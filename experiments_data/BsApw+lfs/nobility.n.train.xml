      <context> But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish . It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel_de_Cervantes ' `` Don_Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide_screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth_Street and Sixty-eighth_Street_Playhouses . More_than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho_Panza , in seventeenth century Spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . Nikolai_Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander_Nevsky and Ivan_the_Terrible , performs the lanky Don_Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner <head>nobility</head> and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . His addle-brained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no_doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues . Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do . He treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect .</context>

      <context> Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present . In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as_much_as_possible speak_for himself . Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family . On his father 's side he was of German descent , on his mother 's he came of the old Swedish <head>nobility</head> . The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake_Va ^ ttern in south central Sweden . It is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations . As a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of Sweden 's ancient glory .</context>
