      <context> These were read at 280 m | m in a Beckman model DU spectrophotometer and tested for antibody activity as described above . For protein identification , fractions from the column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5 ` C or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline . During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at 2 ` C by surrounding the apparatus with ice . Because negative pressure dialysis gave better <head>recovery</head> of proteins , permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler procedure , it was used in all but the earliest experiments . Paper_electrophoresis was carried_out on the concentrated samples in a Spinco model R cell using barbital buffer , pH 8.6 , ionic strength 0.075 , at room_temperature on Whatman 3 MM filter_paper . Five milliamperes / cell were applied for 18 hr , after which the strips were stained with bromophenol_blue and densitometry was carried_out using a Spinco_Analytrol . When paper_electrophoresis was to be used for preparation , eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run / chamber under the conditions described above .</context>
