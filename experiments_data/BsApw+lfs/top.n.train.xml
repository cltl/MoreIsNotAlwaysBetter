      <context> The earliest modern circuses were performed in open air structures with limited <head>covered</head> seating . From the late 18th to late 19th century bespoke circus buildings ( often wooden ) were built with various types of seating , a centre ring and sometimes a stage . The ' traditional ' large tents , commonly known as ' Big Tops ' were introduced in the mid 19th century as touring circuses superseded static venues .</context>

      <context> First attested in English 14th century , the word circus derives from Latin circus , <head>which</head> is the romanization of the Greek κίρκος ( kirkos ) , itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek κρίκος ( krikos ) , meaning " circle " or " ring " . In the book De Spectaculis early Christian writer Tertullian claimed that the first circus games were staged by the goddess Circe in honor of her father Helios , the Sun God . The modern and commonly held idea of a ' circus ' is of a Big Top with various acts providing entertainment therein .</context>

      <context> Some containers such as tubs or jars now have a plastic film heat sealed onto the container : this is often called a <head>lidding</head> film . The word is used metaphorically , as in " keeping the lid on the secret " and " flipped his lid " . An old saying that you never have to put a lid on a bucket of crabs ( because when one gets near the top , another will inevitably pull it down ) is often used as a metaphor for group situations where an individual feels held back by others .</context>
