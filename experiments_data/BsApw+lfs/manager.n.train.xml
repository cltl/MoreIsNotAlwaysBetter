In 1800 , Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed <head>manager</head> of the Lion_Pharmacy . In February 1801 , Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic_battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead . In the following year , 1803 , Oersted , simultaneously with Davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic_battery more_than did salts . Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded_down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' .</context>

For an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment , it must have four properties : ( 1 ) there must be a fixed number of trials , ( 2 ) each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' ( a binomial trial ) , ( 3 ) all trials must have identical probabilities of success , ( 4 ) the trials must be independent of each other . Below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four properties .</context>

In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no_longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning . Some cases in_evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure . An engineer had been made the works <head>manager</head> of a firm , supplanting a retired employee who had been considered outstandingly successful . The engineer had more_than seven years of experience in the firm , was well trained , was considered a hard_worker , was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded_as a `` comer '' .

      <context> An extension of this program into the other distressed areas should be undertaken . Some of this trend toward area vocational_schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry . The major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of pre employment training for a large_number of semi-skilled machine operators . A_few key skilled_workers experienced in the company 's type of work usually must be brought_in with the plant <head>manager</head> , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere . A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training_programs in the area to supply future skilled_workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees . The existence of a public_school vocational training_program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled . Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked_out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being .</context>
