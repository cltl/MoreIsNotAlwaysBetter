It is not enough in accounting_for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect .

      <context> The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials . When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance . These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice . The <head>presence</head> of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even_though it is but vaguely understood . Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed . Experience is not seen , as it is in classical rationalism , as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character , movements , and changes on the tabula_rasa of an uninvolved intellect . Neither is primary experience understood according_to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other_than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense_organs .</context>

      <context> The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data . A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table 5 - 1 . From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude . The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density * * f except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar_system in the <head>presence</head> of solar_radiation pressure . The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors . It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant . The values agree with the data from 1958_Alpha and 1959_Eta .</context>

      <context> Therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial_artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus . If this be true , the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial_arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema .

The <head>presence</head> of normally occurring bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch , and thereafter by many others . Nakamura ( ' 58 ) , Verloop ( ' 48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ( ' 50 ) , von_Hayek ( ' 53 ) , and Tobin ( ' 52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human_being . Miller ( ' 50 ) is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint .

      <context> It is presumed to occur in other members of the Brassica family . There is some evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development of goitre , particularly in Tasmania and Australia ( Clements and Wishart , 1956 ) . There it seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen , which is then secreted in the milk . Besides the <head>presence</head> of goitrogens in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid_gland . In the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia , hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity ( Money , Rall and Rawson , 1952 ; Stanbury , Brownell , Riggs , Perinetti , Itoiz , and Del_Castillo , 1954 ) . In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre is about 100 | mg per day .

      <context> Similar findings have been noted in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzymes , whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide . In_addition , depending_on availability of dietary iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine .

Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid_gland for their release from proteins before secretion . The <head>presence</head> of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid . One of the proteases has pH optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 ( McQuillan , Stanley and Trikojus , 1954 ; Alpers , Robbins and Rall , 1955 ) . The finding that the concentration of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid_glands from TSH treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in_vivo .

      <context> Above , the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds , diluting the valley 's dark to a pallid light . Then the figures which held his attention became a group of shattered trees , standing like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene . Even_so , he could not ease the tension of his body ; the rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax . Sensing the unseen <head>presence</head> of the other men in the patrol , he felt mutely united to these nine near strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him . He sensed something precious in the perilous moment , something akin to the knowledge gained on his bicycle trip through the French countryside , a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness . In France he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown up to the sky , and always as he wandered , he felt a stranger to their exultation . They were poems in a strange language , of which he could barely touch a meaning - enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sensed there .</context>

At the end of a shaft_of_light , the pews appeared to be broad stairs in a long dungeon . Far away , standing before a curtained window in the study room , was his father , hands tucked under his coattails , and staring into the dark church . The figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence .</context>

It was evident that a second transfer had to be effected , and that it had to take_place between the time the fille finished the doctor 's room and the time she began Alex 's . They waited three minutes and_then crept out on tip-toe ; the halls were empty and they passed down_the_stairs to number nine and listened at the door . A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille_de_chambre 's <head>presence</head> inside ; they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact . The doctor shot_down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory was occupied . Although a look of alarm passed_over his face , he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower_room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine . Alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat ; unwarranted they were in_any_case for , as he stood facing the fille_de_chambre , his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower_room .</context>

      <context> All this went through Casey 's mind in the first instant , but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at_all .

He wanted to ask her about Jenkins now , but he knew he could n't do so in Needham 's <head>presence</head> .
