      <context> So with four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 1 , four of No. 2 , four of No. 3 and four to six sets of the Incline_Bench_Press , you can see that Henri_de_Courcy has had a terrific mass building , muscle shaping , torso defining workout that cannot be improved upon . Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone . Rarer still is a Mr._America or Mr._Universe of true Herculean build . The aspects of physical development that catch the <head>judges</head> ' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion - superior definition of the muscles . Now good definition is one thing that all_of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light weight workouts . But contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor 's chisel - is something quite different . This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him .</context>

      <context> Only when the newest Mr._America or Mr._Universe rediscovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once_again see how effective they really are . The exercise I shall discuss in this - the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition specialization of a particular body_part - is the One_Leg_Lunge . Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no_matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ! It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline - that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders - a criterion of muscle `` drama '' that_is unforgettable to <head>judges</head> and audiences alike - the facet of muscular development that wins prizes . Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable . The One_Leg_Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts . But for purely definition purposes - used in conjunction with your regular Squatting , Leg_Curling , Leg_Extensor programs - a heavy weight is not needed .</context>

      <context> These are a great aid for planning use back at the office . For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry_through the study . However , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation . County <head>judges</head> , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and_others who have lived in the area for a long_time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences . A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring_out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area . How much study is required ? This , of_course , depends_on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive_at a good decision .</context>

      <context> But people can n't be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards ) by law . I was having lunch not_long ago ( apologies to N._V._Peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the European Middle_Ages , one in American history , and one in the Far_East ) , and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy '' ( Francis_Thompson 's words for the Hound_of_Heaven 's pursuit ) by judicial fiat . They did n't seem to be able to think_of any . A Virginia <head>judge</head> a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change . But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation - the sort of change which Tacitus was talking_about when he said , `` They make a desert , and call it peace '' ( `` Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' . ) . Moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable ; it can be changed ; it has been , many times .</context>

      <context> The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by Mickey_Spillane 's Mike_Hammer . At_first_glance , this hero seems to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors . For Hammer , nothing is forbidden . He kills when he pleases , takes his women where he finds them and always acts_as <head>judge</head> , jury and executioner rolled_into_one .</context>

      <context> It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government . It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority . Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society . To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative_officials and <head>judges</head> - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with . Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society . Indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society . Government itself was based upon contract ; business_organization - the corporation - was analyzed in contractual terms ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement .</context>

      <context> Cattle stealing and killing , again serious during the spring of 1891 , placed the land_grant company officers in a perplexing position . They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property , thus running_the_risk of creating disturbances such_as that on the Vermejo , and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle_thieves and running_the_risk of being shot . And the law virtually ignored the situation . The <head>judge</head> became ill just as the Colfax_District_Court convened , no substitute was brought_in , no criminal cases heard , only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried , and court adjourned sine_die after sitting a_few days instead_of the usual three weeks . Pels complained : `` Litigants and witnesses were put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact business ; public money spent ; justice delayed ; nothing accomplished , and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute farce '' . Word reached the company that the man behind these depredations was Manuel_Gonzales , a man with many followers , including a number who were kept in line through fear of him .</context>

      <context> Houses of settlers who 'd treated the company herds as a natural_resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards . The small half-heartedly tended fields of men who 'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow . No cow thief could count_on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any_longer . Jury , <head>judge</head> and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated . For three straight years , Tom_Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures , and how_many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he killed Lewis and Powell ) will never be known . It is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at_all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state . It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him .</context>
