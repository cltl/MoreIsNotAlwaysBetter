Near absolute zero , a substance exists as a solid . As heat is added to this substance it melts into a liquid at its melting point , boils into a gas at its boiling point , and if heated high enough would enter a plasma state in which the electrons are so energized that they leave their parent atoms .</context>

      <context> I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal_Newman . As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated country . Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England . In representing part of this new picture , I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments ; but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican_Churches and about the present religious <head>state</head> of England . Since the Protestant clergy for_the_most_part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my Roman_collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman_Catholic cleric . In_any_case , I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen , even in Devonshire and Cornwall , where anti Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest . Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism .</context>

      <context> The true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this . `` Eve was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as_yet she was a virgin . And even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as_yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human_race ; so also did Mary , having a man betrothed [ to her ] , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human_race '' . Because he interprets the primitive <head>state</head> of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no_doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' . His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary . That parallelism affects his picture of man 's disobedience too ; for as it was Christ , the Word_of_God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word_of_God in_the_beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe . With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality .</context>

    <instance id="br-d04#w1554_0" docsrc="br-d04">
      <context> Nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God , and he still rules . Even death , therefore , has a providential as_well_as a punitive function . `` Wherefore also He [ God ] drove him [ man ] out of Paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because He envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because He pitied him , [ and did not desire ] that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable . But He set a bound to his [ <head>state</head> of ] sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take_place in the earth , so_that man , ceasing at_length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to God '' . This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus ' theology ; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ . As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life . It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is .</context>

      <context> The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural_order of time and change . On_the_other_hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence . It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law . If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the <head>state</head> into which man is put by the will of the Creator . This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced . If death receives more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through Christ begins to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence . Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history .</context>

      <context> At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on_trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as_well_as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ?

In_other_words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted_on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .</context>

The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' . But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann 's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it . Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and <head>states</head> . Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ?</context>

The state universities of Maine , New_Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; they had less immigration to contend with . A Yale historian , writing a_few years ago in The Yale_Review , said : `` We in New_England have long_since segregated our children '' . He was referring not_only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory_schools .</context>

      <context> Father_Murray goes_back to the Declaration_of_Independence , too , though I may add , with considerably more historical perception . I will reserve discussion of_it for a moment , however , to return to President_Kennedy . As symptomatic_of the common_man 's malaise , he is most significant : a liberal and a Catholic , elected by the skin_of_his_teeth . Does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , <head>state</head> of the public mind ? What is the common_man 's complaint ? Let 's take a panoramic look back over the course we have come . Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under Eisenhower ?</context>

      <context> This notion of the General Will gave_rise to the Commune_of_Paris in the Revolution and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship . And it is clearly argued by Lord_Percy of Newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , The Heresy_of_Democracy , and in a more general way by Voegelin , in his New_Science_of_Politics , that this same Rousseauan idea , descending through European democracy , is the source of Marx 's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat . This is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after World_War_2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace . The long road that had taken liberals in_this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist <head>State</head> . And the USSR existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in_this country was spiritually Marxist . We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San_Francisco to set_up the legal framework , finally and at_last , to rationalize war - to rationalize want and fear - out of the world : the United_Nations .</context>

      <context> The right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated . To perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming_to_the_fore , and is basically anti democratic . When the proprietor dies , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it . Strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting_as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the <head>state</head> would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part of the whole . Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship .

      <context> There is evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William_Gilmore_Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such_as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him . Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus_Baldwin_Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern <head>states</head> , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy_Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him . Others who wrote_of low characters and low life included Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , creator of the Big_Bear of Arkansas and Tom_Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson_Jones_Hooper , whose character Simon_Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem_Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried_out his will ; and George_Washington_Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut_Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner 's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a_hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner 's time . Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long established literary precedent .</context>

      <context> Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78_th_Congress in 1943 passed P._L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure . Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the <head>States</head> , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services .</context>

      <context> From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public_Law 236 , 66_th_Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation_program has been to assist the <head>States</head> , by means of grants-in-aid , to return disabled men and women to productive , gainful employment . The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation_program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social_Security_Act in 1935 . Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78_th_Congress in 1943 passed P._L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure .</context>

      <context> Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the <head>States</head> on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services . Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry_out the provisions of the Act . The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational_rehabilitation_program , providing_for a three part grant structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational_rehabilitation - and in_addition for short-term training and instruction .</context>

The Act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State . It stipulates , in_addition , that all amounts remaining as_a_result_of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums .</context>

      <context> This is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential_energy for equilibrium . This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields . The relation between osmotic_pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way . In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics_of_equilibrium ( referred to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady <head>state</head> . This can be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared . This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' . There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed_out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar .</context>

In_other_words , if an ideal_gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat_sink .

      <context> Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types . Two of the fluids showed a high positive normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in_comparison_with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two . Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure . Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady <head>state</head> was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built_up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate . A system had_to be used which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time . A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure . By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular_weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an atmosphere .</context>

The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular_weights which were stated to be 520 and 300 . These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular_weight . The maximum suction was 3.25 '' of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady <head>states</head> were apparently reached with these fluids . It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus . This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head * * f since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes .

      <context> This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock_therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl_test . Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl_test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm . Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not_yet been tested on an adequate number of patients . The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical <head>states</head> , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable . It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep wakefulness cycle . A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting .

      <context> Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political_system that was central to world politics for a century . International_law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European_nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international_law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political_system in which a number of <head>states</head> were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; second , it had to be compatible with the value_system that they shared . In both respects , international_law was Europeanized . It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions . On_the_one_hand , the major European_nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience .</context>

      <context> Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society . Indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society . Government itself was based upon contract ; business_organization - the corporation - was analyzed in contractual terms ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement . It is not surprising that the international obligations of <head>states</head> were also viewed in_terms_of contract . In_fact , some - Anzilotti is the principle example - went so far as to say that all international_law could be traced to the single legal norm , Pacta sunt Servanda . The displacement ( at_least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international_law theory and doctrine . In_the_first_place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal_system .</context>

Private international_law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international_law proper , or , as it is often called , public international_law . <head>States</head> were free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , their own rules as_to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law_merchant , and to enact legislation with regard_to many claims arising on the high_seas .

During the Brown trial , however , the <head>state</head> 's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence_Daily_Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not_only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal_governments . The Providence_Daily_Journal answered the Daily_Post by stating that the raid of John_Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican_Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' . The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history . While the Daily_Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily_Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket_Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men .</context>
