      <context> The aspects of physical development that catch the judges ' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion - superior definition of the muscles . Now good definition is one thing that all_of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light weight workouts . But contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor 's chisel - is something quite different . This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the <head>knowledge</head> of exactly what works best for him . Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others . Because they are `` minority '' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten . Only when the newest Mr._America or Mr._Universe rediscovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once_again see how effective they really are .</context>

      <context> Roy_Mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of John_Sell_Cotman . And like this English master , Mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in_reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them . As a boy Roy_Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods . His father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting_expeditions , and imparted to them his <head>knowledge</head> and love of nature . Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on_the_wing - almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . It is this subject_matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors . Mason had_to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting .</context>

      <context> The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it . In_fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in_this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears . In_fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty . Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased <head>knowledge</head> of the nature of disease .

      <context> Then the figures which held his attention became a group of shattered trees , standing like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene . Even_so , he could not ease the tension of his body ; the rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax . Sensing the unseen presence of the other men in the patrol , he felt mutely united to these nine near strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him .

      <context> He found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap , and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt , its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost .

David_Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface . He knew that many were using it for their own ends .

      <context> Was it love ? I had no_doubt that it was . During the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster_casts and spatter prints of Catskill flowers and leaves was all_but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions of Jessica that my mind served_up to me for contemplation and delight . Nothing in_all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a <head>knowledge</head> of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world . In final separation from them , in the railroad_terminal across the river from New_York , I would nearly cry . My parents ' welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted . But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or mess-hall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond .</context>

What I'm getting at is that we were fully prepared for Felix 's being an odd one . We 'd seen his handiwork out in the back_yard , and the little his tenants had told us of him did make him sound a_little special .
