      <context> Insurance <head>contracts</head> are generally considered contracts of adhesion because the insurer draws up the contract and the insured has little or no ability to make material changes to it . This is interpreted to mean that the insurer bears the burden if there is any ambiguity in any terms of the contract . Insurance policies are sold without the policyholder even seeing a copy of the contract .</context>

      <context> The insurance contract or agreement is a contract whereby the insurer will pay the insured ( the person <head>whom</head> benefits would be paid to , or on behalf of ) , if certain defined events occur .

The uncertainty can be either as to when the event will happen ( e.g. in a life insurance policy , the time of the insured 's death is uncertain ) or as to if it will happen at all ( e.g. in a fire insurance policy , whether or not a fire will occur at all ) .</context>

      <context> Insurance contracts were traditionally written on the basis of every single type of risk ( where risks were defined extremely <head>narrowly</head> ) , and a separate premium was calculated and charged for each . This system of " specific risk " or " named perils " coverage proved to be unsustainable in the context of the Second Industrial Revolution , in that a typical large conglomerate might have dozens of types of risks to insure against . For example , in 1926 , an insurance industry spokesman noted that a bakery would have to buy a separate policy for each of the following risks : manufacturing operations , elevators , teamsters , product liability , contractual liability ( for a spur track connecting the bakery to a nearby railroad ) , premises liability ( for a retail store ) , and owners ' protective liability ( for negligence of contractors hired to make any building modifications ) .</context>

If the insured desires coverage for a risk taken out by an exclusion on the standard form , the insured can sometimes pay an additional premium for an endorsement to the policy that overrides the exclusion .

The largest of these organizations at_present denies to the full_time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog . This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students . The professor in_turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the <head>policies</head> and standards of which he has no voice . This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands .

The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first_step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West .

The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in_fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet <head>policy</head> .

The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence .

While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United_States since World_War_2 , . Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here presented . The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price_competition , but which is so basic that its wage price <head>policies</head> are held in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . In_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation .</context>

The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage <head>policy</head> - its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment . The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases , but we abstract from these forces here . For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs . Productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time_period is not even well_known to the industry , much_less to the union or to the public .</context>

      <context> For the purposes of this discussion , the problem of relative prices is encompassed in these two variables , since GNP includes other prices . ( We abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change proportionately . ) The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of GNP . The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price <head>policies</head> are affected with a public interest . Because of its importance , and because the lack of price_competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases . The threat of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of endangering relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases . For the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry limited price ( but not below average_cost ) .</context>
