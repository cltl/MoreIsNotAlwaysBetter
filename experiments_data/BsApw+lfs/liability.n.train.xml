More word_class ratios determined in more languages will no_doubt ultimately answer the question . If word_classes differ in their resistance or <head>liability</head> to stem replacement within meaning slot , it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans lingually . Hoijer 's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings ( with allowance for several near synonyms like stomach belly , big large , long far , many much , die dead , say speak ) . For Yokuts , I tabulated these 71 items in five columns , according_as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more_than 4 stems . The totals for these five categories are not too uneven , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively .</context>
