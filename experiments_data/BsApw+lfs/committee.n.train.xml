      <context> Under Formby 's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant_governor , speaker of the House , attorney_general and chief_justice of the Texas_Supreme_Court . State representatives decided Thursday against taking_a_poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State_Affairs_Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . Rep._Wesley_Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the <head>committee</head> can kill the bill . The West_Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman_Bill_Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice .</context>

      <context> Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . But questions with which committee_members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of_it . Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal_year next Aug. 31 . He told the <head>committee</head> the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on_the_books `` since Texas was a republic '' . It permits the state to take_over bank_accounts , stocks and other personal_property of persons missing for seven years or more . The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance_firms , pipeline_companies and other corporations to report such property to the state_treasurer . The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared .</context>

      <context> State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called_for yesterday in a report of a `` blue_ribbon '' citizens_committee on the aid to dependent children program . The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New_York_City welfare consulting_firm , listed 10 long_range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case_load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C._Virgil_Martin , president of Carson_Pirie_Scott_+_Co. , <head>committee</head> chairman . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend_upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' .</context>

      <context> According_to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church_of_England , the `` total of confirmed members is 9748000 , but only 2887671 are registered on the parochial church_rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church_of_England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' . An amazing article in the Manchester_Guardian of last November , entitled `` Fate of Redundant Churches '' , states than an Archbishops ' Commission `` reported last month that in the Church_of_England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years ' time . A further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 '' . And in the last five years , the `` Methodist chapel <head>committee</head> has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels '' . Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman_Catholics '' , and have done so . While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population_shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going_to church . It should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics ( one paper writes 50 per_cent ) .</context>

      <context> In 1930 , the Lambeth_Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate . In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth_control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere . Many other Protestant_denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action . In March , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a <head>committee</head> of the Federal_Council_of_Churches ratified artificial methods of birth_control . `` As_to the necessity '' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question . There is general_agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual_affection without relation_to procreation is right '' . Since then , many Protestant_denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not_only approved birth_control , but declared it at_times to be a religious duty .</context>

      <context> To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company 's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain_from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . With their customary source of supply cut_off , the Fort_Garry free_traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country . Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St._Paul and goods from St._Paul to Red_River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement . This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per_cent after February 1835 , but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per_cent on the initiative of the London <head>committee</head> . The trade in a_few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49 th parallel .</context>
