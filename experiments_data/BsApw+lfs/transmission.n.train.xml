      <context> <head>===</head> Audio === AM radio uses amplitude modulation , in which the amplitude of the transmitted signal is made proportional to the sound amplitude captured ( transduced ) by the microphone , while the transmitted frequency remains unchanged . Transmissions are affected by static and interference because lightning and other sources of radio emissions on the same frequency add their amplitudes to the original transmitted amplitude .</context>

      <context> An <head>antenna</head> ( or aerial ) is an electrical device which converts electric currents into radio waves , and vice versa . It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver . In transmission , a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency ( i.e. high frequency AC ) to the antenna 's terminals , and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves ( radio waves ) .</context>

      <context> Amplitude modulation of a carrier wave works by varying the <head>strength</head> of the transmitted signal in proportion to the information being sent . For example , changes in the signal strength can be used to reflect the sounds to be reproduced by a speaker , or to specify the light intensity of television pixels .

      <context> Radio frequencies occupy the range from a 3 kHz to 300 GHz , although commercially important uses of radio use only a small part of this spectrum .

It was first applied to communications in 1881 when , at the suggestion of French scientist Ernest Mercadier , Alexander Graham Bell adopted " radiophone " ( meaning " radiated sound " ) as an alternate name for his photophone optical transmission system .</context>

Various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound_waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean_floors , and even communicate under water . In medicine the frequencies are much higher , transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in sonar . Because the body contains so much liquid , <head>transmission</head> of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood_vessels .

      <context> But then this theory confesses that it is completely at_a_loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain . The opening paragraph of the chapter titled The_Theory_Of_Representative_Perception , in the book Philosophies_Of_Science by Albert_G._Ramsperger says , `` passed_on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception '' . But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather_than to theorize on the <head>transmission</head> of an image which is already in required location . Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness . Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists_of minute waves of energy . We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound_waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite .</context>
