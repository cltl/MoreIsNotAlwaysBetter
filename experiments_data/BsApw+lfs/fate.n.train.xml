Carl Jung coined the <head>term</head> synchronicity , which he described as " a meaningful coincidence " .

      <context> Before the adoption of luck at <head>the</head> end of the Middle Ages , Old English and Middle English expressed the notion of " good fortune " with the word speed ( Middle English spede , Old English spēd ) ; speed besides " good fortune " had the wider meaning of " prosperity , profit , abundance " ; it is not associated with the notion of probability or chance but rather with that of fate or divine help ; a bestower of success can also be called speed , as in " Christ be our speed " ( William Robertson , Phraseologia generalis , 1693 ) . The notion of probability was expressed by the Latin loanword chance , adopted in Middle English from the late 13th century , literally describing an outcome as a " falling " ( as it were of dice ) , via Old French cheance from Late Latin cadentia " falling " . Fortuna , the Roman goddess of fate or luck , was popular as an allegory in medieval times , and even though it was not strictly reconcilable with Christian theology , it became popular in learned circles of the High Middle Ages to portray her as a servant of God in distributing success or failure in a characteristically " fickle " or unpredictable way , thus introducing the notion of chance .</context>

      <context> He flounders and lets music sprawl . There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion . So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein , but not great Brahms . The concert opened with another big romantic score , Schumann's Overture_to_Manfred , which suffered <head>fate</head> , this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat . Hindemith 's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands translucent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit . It got the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style . The Bayreuth_Festival opens July 23 with a new production of `` Tannhaeuser '' staged by Wieland_Wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by Wolfgang_Sawallisch .</context>

      <context> A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city_university , following Anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated Mass before more_than a_hundred . The Protestants themselves are the first to admit the great falling_off in effective membership in their churches . According_to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church_of_England , the `` total of confirmed members is 9748000 , but only 2887671 are registered on the parochial church_rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church_of_England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' . An amazing article in the Manchester_Guardian of last November , entitled `` <head>Fate</head> of Redundant Churches '' , states than an Archbishops ' Commission `` reported last month that in the Church_of_England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years ' time . A further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 '' . And in the last five years , the `` Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels '' . Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman_Catholics '' , and have done so .</context>

      <context> fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the nations . But though this characterization in_no_way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of_it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting <head>fates</head> of the countries in which the Final_Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? Should not everyone have been awakened to_it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard_to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by_no_means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .</context>

      <context> Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage . Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations . First , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma . Second , they believed it important to determine the <head>fate</head> of the captain - a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on American towns and counties , on a great American river , and on half a_million square_miles of Arctic seas . The name : Henry_Hudson . This is the story of his last tragic voyage , as_nearly_as we are able - or ever , probably , will be able - to determine : The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson 's fourth in four years .</context>

      <context> The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies . We should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call_for effort as_well_as enthusiasm . Above_all , we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible_for their <head>fates</head> . Only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance . With_respect_to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their illusions , we can afford to wait , for in_time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see . Our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments .</context>

      <context> When Napoleon 's ship had borne him to Elba , French wines had started to cross the Channel , the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years , but the supplies had not_yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled . As they waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in_hand , while Byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers . `` Sex is overpriced '' , he said . `` The great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against <head>Fate</head> , not man against man for the prize of a woman 's body .

When the <head>fate</head> of the individual is visited on the group , then ( the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently ) , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted .
