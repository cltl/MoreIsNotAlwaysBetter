      <context> All just by_chance , and in_a_way tracing back to poor Frank , all_of it , because naturally - brothers , living together - and Angie - Mr._Skyros did not at all like the look on Angelo 's regular featured , almost girlishly good-looking face - or indeed anything about Angelo . Mr._Skyros was not a man who thought very_much about moral_principles ; he found money much more interesting ; but all_the_same he thought now , uneasily , of the way in which Angelo earned his living - and paid for his own stuff - and eyed the soft smile , and the spaniel like dark eyes , and he felt a_little ill . `` Look , my friend '' , he said , `` in my life I learn , how is it the proverb says , better an ounce of prevention to a <head>pound</head> of cure . I stay in business so long because I 'm careful . Two_weeks , a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this_and_that , then we make a little deal , is n't it '' ? `` That 's a long while '' , said Angie .</context>

      <context> Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target . Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte_Gulf area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships . Greg himself took two flights , with Todman leading the second , to patrol and look_for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte . Each plane carried two five-hundred <head>pound</head> bombs . A weapons_carrier took Greg , Todman , Belton , Banjo_Ferguson , and Walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip . It was a rough long ride through the mud and pot_holes . No one had much to say .</context>
