      <context> Ten is the base of the decimal numeral system , by far the most <head>common</head> system of denoting numbers in both spoken and written language . The reason for the choice of ten is assumed to be that humans have ten fingers ( digits ) . A collection of ten items ( most often ten years ) is called a decade .</context>

      <context> It was with the assistance of one of the members of_this expedition , Lauritz_Esmarch , that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric_discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric_current was made to flow . Together they also developed a new form of voltaic_cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper , thereby producing stronger currents . Esmarch was among those who witnessed Oersted 's first demonstration of his discovery . The association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic_forces had been recognized by investigators for many <head>decades</head> . Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles . In the late 1700 's Beccaria and van_Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it . Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden_jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch spring steel making its ends magnetic .</context>

      <context> Do you have a long-term ( 5 - or 10 - yr . ) marketing program ? The key to effective marketing is wrapped_up in defining your company 's marketing problems realistically . Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management .

Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge .</context>

      <context> Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts . The change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention - practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted . Have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under_way during the first <head>decade</head> . As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share_in the manufacturer 's as_well as the distributor 's profits - which is , in_effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do . Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded . Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain_stores have insisted on high_quality - and the customer seems to have caught_on .</context>

      <context> He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman_Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy . A year later in Albany , N._Y. , a Roman_Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned_Parenthood_Association . Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious_belief and conscience . These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several <head>decades</head> has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue . It has flared_up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family welfare agencies . It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries . Where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment .</context>

      <context> The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation . The first_step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good_will and friendly communication on other_than the polemical level . Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached . `` All_too frequently '' , points_out James_O'_Gara , managing_editor of Commonweal , `` Catholics run_roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth_control has changed in recent <head>decades</head> '' . All_too often our language is unduly harsh . The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family_planning . Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .</context>

      <context> Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one . I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high_school and was highly successful in the business which he entered . He may or may_not be `` better_off '' than his classmate who went_on to a college and professional school . But in the next <head>decades</head> the nation needs_to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent . In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high_school where he is found . In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation . High motivation towards higher_education must start early enough so_that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at_least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work .</context>

In response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion_picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day . Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at_heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short_story . Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .</context>

      <context> Adam_Smith was wrong . Not_only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism . The rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe and the United_States dates_from the period 1880 - 1900 . Now , although the roots of the mystery_story in serious literature go_back as far as Balzac , Dickens , and Poe , it was not until the closing <head>decades</head> of the 19_th century that the private_detective became an established figure in popular fiction . Sherlock_Holmes , the ancestor of all private_eyes , was born during the 1890 s . Thus the transformation of Adam_Smith 's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life . Driven from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguises himself as a private_detective .</context>

      <context> Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark_Young 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner 's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the <head>decades</head> before the Civil_War . It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen_Glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society . Faulkner 's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life . They have an ancestry extending back , however , at_least to 1728 , when William_Byrd described the Lubberlanders he encountered in the back_country of Virginia and North_Carolina .</context>

There is evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William_Gilmore_Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such_as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him .</context>

It is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by_no_means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research . The student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at_the_same_time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another . Let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought - turning our attention from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent <head>decades</head> . We may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts .

No one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them .</context>

Further we cannot go , for the Dark_ages deserve their name . Many aspects of civilization were not_yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure .

Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist . It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that informs those details .
