      <context> Richards ' view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety : for him it constitutes , in part , the organization of impulses .

In the wide <head>range</head> of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate . The study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way . William_Wimsatt and Cleanth_Brooks , it seems to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in_which this control is effected : `` For if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation ) - then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affections at_all . Something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like '' expressions `` of these emotions , without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement '' .</context>

      <context> Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical_exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon_tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate . Data on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in Table /1 . . In series /1 , the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the <head>range</head> from 14.7 to 29.2 cm. . The last column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4 ( 14.7 cm. distance ) calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity . Direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series /2 , where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen .</context>

      <context> The intra nasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organisms . The importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated . The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory_tract , such_as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi , are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence . Very small particles , however , in a size <head>range</head> of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar_bed of the lungs .

      <context> Furthermore , a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety . Although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present , different autonomic somatic patterns underlie aggression and anxiety , respectively , as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines , the state of the muscle_tone , and the Mecholyl_test . The psychological incompatibility of these emotional_states seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference . In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological <head>range</head> , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems , respectively . We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic somatic downward discharge as_well_as regarding the hypothalamic cortical discharge . Although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first approximation , it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic cortical discharges account_for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances , in experimental and clinical neurosis , and as the result of psychopharmacological agents . In_view_of the important role which emotional_disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes .</context>
