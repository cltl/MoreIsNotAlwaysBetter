Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress .

But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at_work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another . Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype - a `` How are you now '' ? or an `` I want to go_home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning .

There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the startled horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are_born at the end of an ancestral line long_since divorced from money-making and which , besides , has kept its estate intact .

Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers . Then she fell_asleep again as suddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes . She stood_up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming_in or going_out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in_a_moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests .</context>
