      <context> Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann 's heroes . The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns_on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love .

This prohibition on love has an especially poignant <head>relation</head> to art ; it is particularly the artist ( Tonio_Kro^ger , Aschenbach , Leverku^hn ) who suffers from it . The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough '' in the realm of art .

      <context> His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him . My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked_at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by_no_means new with him , and most_of the problems he takes_up have had the attention of authors before him . A useful comment on his <head>relation</head> to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region . The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at_least since John_Pendleton_Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank_Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature . The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil_War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way_of_life which had been destroyed . As they looked with_nostalgia to a society which had been swept_away , they were probably no_more than half conscious that they painted_in_colors which had never existed .</context>

      <context> Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp . The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas_Nelson_Page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So_Red_the_Rose , by Stark_Young . Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark_Young 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential <head>relation</head> with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner 's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil_War . It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen_Glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society .</context>

The psychological incompatibility of these emotional_states seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference .

We stressed the reciprocal <head>relation</head> of these systems with respect to the autonomic somatic downward discharge as_well_as regarding the hypothalamic cortical discharge . Although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first approximation , it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic cortical discharges account_for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances , in experimental and clinical neurosis , and as the result of psychopharmacological agents . In_view_of the important role which emotional_disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes .</context>

The foreign entry limit price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage rates do not enter foreign costs directly . Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure .

      <context> The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of GNP . The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest . Because of its importance , and because the lack of price_competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases . The threat of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of endangering relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some <head>relation</head> to cost increases . For the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry limited price ( but not below average_cost ) . For such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs ( due_to rising wages , etc . ) . Thus , if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate .</context>

      <context> Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's_length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; the granular texture thus created likewise called_attention_to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . These areas by_virtue_of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued - and set to shuttling again - only by conventional perspective ; that_is , by being placed in such <head>relation</head> to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth .

It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint .</context>

      <context> The trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no_longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses , but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing_paper and establish depth on top of_it . Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper , and the only lesser immediacy of block_capitals that simulate window lettering , manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture_plane so that it does not `` jump '' . At_the_same_time , the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them , and by their placing in_relation_to the block_capitals ; and these capitals seem in_turn to be pushed_back by their placing , and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining . Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every_other part and plane ; and it is as if the only stable <head>relation</head> left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface . And the same thing , more_or_less , can be said of the contents of Picasso 's first collage . In later collages of both masters , a variety of extraneous materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in_conjunction_with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think_of . The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material - or simply of a painted in form - will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth .</context>
