      <context> This is n't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11 - year old boys in America cannot chin themselves once , and that English school_girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) . The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw . For arm and shoulder strength a chinning_bar is recommended . It should be installed over a <head>door</head> that is in_full_view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a_little to one side . Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin_up each time they pass under it . Those who are too weak , should climb_on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down . When they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin_up .</context>

      <context> Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded_down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' . He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood . The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level . His broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many <head>doors</head> to him . His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong . The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek_out the philosophers as he had on his first journey . In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws_of_nature in German and this was issued in French translation ( Paris , 1813 ) under the title Recherches_sur_l_'_identite_des_forces_chimiques_et_electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists .</context>

      <context> What one actually remembers is its greenness . From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible . One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower . Every path from back <head>door</head> to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit_trees . In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet_shrub , snowball , rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead . From above one could only occasionally catch_a_glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block . That was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch .</context>

      <context> Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field . A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy . The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials . When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the <head>door</head> of consciousness and clamors for entrance . These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice . The presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even_though it is but vaguely understood . Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed .</context>

      <context> Thus the cocktail_party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness . In_spite_of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group , the * * f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving_system beyond comprehension if N exceeds about six . The crowd consequently breaks_up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes . For the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a_few honored newcomers , then the `` open_house '' system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the <head>door</head> . We consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land_sites necessary for family subsistence . We assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most_of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in Figure 2 . Information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second - , third - , and fourth hand as a distortable rumor .</context>

      <context> I realized , now , that she had been showing me , in what impressed me as being a very accurate way , something her mother had once said to her ; it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her . What had been an unmanageably powerful introject was now , despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like . Earlier , this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at_times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice . A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used_to often seclude herself in her room , often sounded through the closed <head>door</head> - as I would find on passing_by , between our sessions - for_all_the_world like two persons , a scolding mother and a defensive child . Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome . I have found , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior . For_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got_up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the end of each session .</context>

      <context> No suburban shopping-center branch - not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store . Telephone_orders distort the picture : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather_than a central city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminates city sales_tax . The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass <head>doors</head> had never opened . Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are . In many cases that statement `` We break_even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' would be turned_around if the cost_analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store . Fear of the competition - always a great motivating force in the American economy - makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival 's shiny new branches .</context>
