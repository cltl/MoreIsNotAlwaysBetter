      <context> Friends , a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary_organization of employees of the Gulf_Telephone_Company at Foley , Alabama . `` If the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf_Coast '' , the account reads , `` they can count_on heavy opposition from a group of commando trained telephone employees - all girls . Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast moving Civil_Defense outfit , 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move_into action at a minute 's notice '' . According_to Friends , the unit was organized by John_Snook , a former World_War_/2 , commando who is <head>vice_president</head> and general_manager of the telephone_company . The girls , very fetching in their uniforms , are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump_truck ; they are also trained with carbines , automatic weapons , pistols , rifles and other such ladies ' accessories . This may be opera_bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold_war mount in frenzy . The country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means .</context>

      <context> A former du_Pont official became a General_Motors <head>vice_president</head> and set_about maximizing du_Pont 's share of the General_Motors market . Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several du_Pont products were actively promoted . Within a_few years various du_Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General_Motors ' eight operating divisions . The Fisher_Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting_trust even though General_Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from du_Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General_Motors divisions .</context>

      <context> This was nearly completed May 23 , 1901 with a promise of lights by June 10 , but the first light did not go_on until September 28 . It was at the end of the sidewalk in_front of the Dellwood_Cemetery cottage . The first directors of the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company were John_Marsden , M._L._Manley , William_F._Orvis , George_Smith , and John_Blackmer . The officers were John_Marsden , president ; John_C._Blackmer , <head>vice-president</head> ; George_Smith , treasurer ; and William_F._Orvis , secretary . Marsden was manager of the company for ten years and manager of its successor company , the Colonial_Light_and_Power_Company , for one year . At about the time the Marsden enterprise was getting under_way , the Vail_Light_and_Lumber_Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present Bennington_Co-operative_Creamery , intending to use its surplus power for generating electricity . Manchester then had two competing power_companies until 1904 , when the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company purchased the transmission system of the Vail_Company .</context>

      <context> Early equipment was very flimsy ; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles , making communications impossible . But companies continued to spring_up . By 1883 the `` Battenkill_Telegraph_Company '' was in existence and Alvin_Pettibone was its president . Operating in 1887 was the `` Valley_Telegraph_Line '' , officers of which were E._C._Orvis , president ; H._K._Fowler , <head>vice-president</head> and secretary ; J._N._Hard , treasurer ; F._H._Walker , superintendent ; H._S._Walker , assistant superintendent . Two companies now had headquarters with Clark_J._Wait , who by then had his own drugstore at Factory_Point - the `` Northern_Union_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Western_Union '' . Operators were Arthur_Koop and Norman_Taylor . Still existing on a `` Northern_Union '' telegraph_form is a typical peremptory message from Peru grocer J._J._Hapgood to Burton and Graves ' store in Manchester - `` Get and send by stage sure four pounds best Porterhouse or sirloin steak , for Mrs._Hapgood send six sweet_oranges '' .</context>

      <context> Lawrence could not put his finger on_it precisely , and this worried him . When you disliked or distrusted a man , you should have a reason .

He observed the Florentine vase in the hall , the Renoir painting in the library , as_well_as the long shelves of well-bound volumes ; the pattern of the Oriental rug , the delicate cut-glass chandelier . He said to the Secretary , `` I understand you came from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre .</context>
