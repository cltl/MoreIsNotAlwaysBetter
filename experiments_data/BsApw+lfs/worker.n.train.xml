      <context> Not always , though , does the development of a bumblebee colony take_place in the smooth fashion we have just described . Some members of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives . Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo_bumblebee '' as it is called in some European_countries . Female individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the <head>workers</head> and queens of the bumblebees they victimize . The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind_legs which in the case of the idler , Psithyrus , lack the pollen baskets - naturally ! The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host . When she succeeds , she usually manages to slip_in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment .</context>

      <context> When she succeeds , she usually manages to slip_in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment . The hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally . Thus , the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread . Later_on , they and the mother Psithyrus are fed by the Bombus <head>workers</head> . Worse still , in a number of cases it has been claimed that the Psithyrus female kills_off the Bombus queen . But let us return , after this gruesome interlude , to our willow catkins in the spring ; there are other wild bees that command our attention . It is almost certain that some of these , usually a_trifle smaller than the honeybees , are andrenas or mining_bees .</context>

      <context> Each now makes a tough , papery cocoon and pupates . After another two_weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker_bees , collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen retires to a life of egg_laying . The first worker_bees do not mate or lay eggs ; males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season . The broods of <head>workers</head> that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed . By the middle of the summer , many_of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is `` optimal '' , and it is then that young queens begin to appear . Simultaneously , males or drones are produced , mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers , although a few may be produced by the queen . The young queens and drones leave the nest and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the fertilized young queens will begin to dig in for the winter .</context>

      <context> The structured schools were in an industrial city , with three family tenement_houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes . The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle - to upper-middle_class , but fringed by an industrial area . In_order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods . School_principals and guidance <head>workers</head> made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas . An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data . Equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle_class neighborhoods . Individual differences in maturation and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement .</context>

      <context> The Taylor_Scale was adapted from the Minnesota_Multiphastic_Personality_Inventory , with item selection based upon clinical definitions of anxiety . There is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees . Reliability and validation work with the Children 's Anxiety_Scale by Castaneda , et_al. demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale . Although the Taylor_Scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained <head>workers</head> who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items . The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . The two ratings yield a correlation of + .04 , which is not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics . In_theory , compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer .</context>

      <context> Much of the available information comes not from the Federal_government but from an exchange of experiences among states . State and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities .

      <context> The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches . Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act_as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover . When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing . Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the <head>worker</head> with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easier than to the downtown department_store , though both are the same distance from home . Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown . Raymond_Vernon reports that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the lot next_door .</context>
