The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great_Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War_of_1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go_to Red_River where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest_Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire . The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the <head>output</head> of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward .

Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort_Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland .</context>

      <context> The mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked_out , but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin ( Astwood , 1954 ) . On_the_other_hand , there are a_few antithyroid drugs of this same general type , such as resorcinol , possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine . Any of the antithyroid drugs , of either type , if given in large enough doses for a long period_of_time will cause goitre , owing to inhibition of thyroid_hormone synthesis , with production of hypothyroidism . The anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased <head>output</head> of TSH , causing the thyroid to enlarge . The effect of drugs that act_on the iodide concentrating mechanism can be counteracted by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet .
