      <context> But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing_officer 's report to be likewise turned_over to the registrant . While the regulations formerly required that the hearing_officer 's report be placed in the registrant 's file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952 . Moreover , the hearing_officer 's report is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney_General and , of_course , is not the recommendation of the Department . It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an <head>attorney</head> in the Department_of_Justice , of which the Attorney_General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection . It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes_into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board . It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing_officer 's notes were furnished to the appeal board . Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board .</context>
