In_any_event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at_all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen_fit to place us .

      <context> It is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some code of `` right '' and `` wrong '' . I do not know that this is true ; both Flugel and Ranyard_West deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologians as Niebuhr and Buber . It forms the core of many , perhaps most , problems of psychotherapy . I am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary_study in the development of conscience - most_of their attention is to a pre-literate <head>period</head> of life , or , for the theologians of_course , to the influence of religion . Still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one 's ideas of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic_books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of_this influence . Probably the most important thing to focus_on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available .

      <context> The actual moments of contact are vitally important . These moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative_literature must be frequently concerned .

Certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any <head>period</head> of Western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the Bible .

In much the same way , we recognize the importance of Shakespeare 's familarity with Plutarch and Montaigne , of Shelley 's study of Plato 's dialogues , and of Coleridge 's enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from Plato to Schelling and William_Godwin , through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of English men_of_letters .</context>

      <context> An idea , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned . In this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas , that are so_to_speak `` writ_large '' in history of literature where they recur continually . Outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself , including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries ; also secondary notions such_as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man . One might , indeed , argue that the history of ideas , in_so_far as it includes the literatures , must center_on characterizations of human nature and that the great <head>periods</head> of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning . We need not , to_be_sure , expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature . An idea , of the sort that we have_in_mind , although of_necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images , especially those appearing in lyric_poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience . Thus Burns 's `` My love is like a red , red rose '' and Hopkins ' `` The thunder-purple sea beach , plumed purple of thunder '' although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned .</context>

On_the_other_hand , Arnold 's `` The unplumbed , salt , estranging sea '' , taken in its context , certainly does so .

Thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject_matter typical or atypical of its <head>period</head> . Again , he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways . Our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries . Very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or `` belongs_to '' some way of thought labelled as a `` school '' or an `` - ism '' , i._e. a complex or `` syndrome '' of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification .</context>

For purposes of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the States `` unadjusted Federal share '' . Beginning in 1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as_required ) 25 % a_year , so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40 % pivot State share , with maximum and minimum State shares of 50 % and 30 % , respectively .

      <context> Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence . It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as_well_as Hand , it seems to be the method_of_choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood . As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions - particularly the former - provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age <head>period</head> . Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress . It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2 . As one approach to doing this , Figures 3 and 4 have been constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 .</context>

      <context> It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as_well_as Hand , it seems to be the method_of_choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood . As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions - particularly the former - provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period . Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific <head>periods</head> of delay in skeletal developmental progress . It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2 . As one approach to doing this , Figures 3 and 4 have been constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 . The differences between onset age and completion age with_respect_to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows .</context>

The first attempts to isolate TSH came a decade later , when Janssen and Loeser ( 1931 ) used trichloroacetic_acid to separate the soluble TSH from insoluble impurities . After their work other investigators applied salt fractionation techniques to the problem , as_well_as fractionation with organic solvents , such_as acetone . Albert ( 1949 ) has concluded that the most active preparations of TSH made during this <head>period</head> , from 1931 to 1945 , were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material . Much of this work has been reviewed by White ( 1944 ) and by Albert ( 1949 ) . Developments up_to about 1957 have been discussed by Sonenberg ( 1958 ) . In the last few years , the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the problem of isolating TSH has led to further purification ( Bates and Condliffe , 1960 ; Pierce , Carsten and Wynston , 1960 ) .</context>

      <context> Second , what is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction ? It is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary TSH if the fragmentary chemical information about blood TSH is to be discussed rationally . The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 ) . Whether this abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH , or is , alternatively , normal TSH with its <head>period</head> of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible_for the blood activity with pituitary TSH . In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them . The introduction of the United_States_Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid stimulating activity have made_it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time . We should_like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in_terms_of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units .</context>

The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia . This patient was a 65 - year old white male accountant who entered the New_York_Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . In 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood_transfusions were given over a <head>period</head> of 4 years . Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered foci of fibrosis '' suggestive_of myelofibrosis .

Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social_system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective . In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . The colonial <head>period</head> has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them - and that with independence free_men do not have_to work to realize the benefits of modern life .

The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence .

Since writing was practiced in the Aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful .

The dominant pottery of the century was Geometric ; political organization revolved_about the basileis ; trade was just beginning to expand ; the gods who protected the Greek countryside were only now putting_on their sharply anthropomorphic dress . The modern student , who knows what was to come next , is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century . Not all men of the <head>period</head> would have accepted this emphasis . Many potters clung_to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas ; the poet of the Iliad deliberately archaized . Although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era , I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of Greek civilization . On this principle of division I must postpone the evolution of sculpture , architecture , society , and politics ; for the developments in these areas make_sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself .</context>
