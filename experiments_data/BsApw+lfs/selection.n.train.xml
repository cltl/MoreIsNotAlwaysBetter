Johnson makes this accusation of atheism with reference to Charles Hodge 's book What Is Darwinism <head>?</head> ( 1874 ) . However , unlike Johnson , Hodge confined the term to exclude those like American botanist Asa Gray who combined Christian faith with support for Darwin 's natural selection theory , before answering the question posed in the book 's title by concluding : " It is Atheism .

While the term Darwinism had been used previously to refer to the work of Erasmus Darwin in the late 18th century , the term as understood today was introduced when Charles Darwin 's 1859 book On the Origin of Species was reviewed by Thomas Henry Huxley in the April 1860 issue of the Westminster Review .

      <context> The most prominent example of evolutionary psychology <head>,</head> notably advanced in the early work of Noam Chomsky and later by Steven Pinker , is the hypothesis that the human brain has adapted to acquire the grammatical rules of natural language . Other aspects of human behaviour and social structures , from specific cultural norms such as incest avoidance to broader patterns such as gender roles , have been hypothesised to have similar origins as adaptations to the early environment in which modern humans evolved . By analogy to the action of natural selection on genes , the concept of memes—"units of cultural transmission , " or culture 's equivalents of genes undergoing selection and recombination—has arisen , first described in this form by Richard Dawkins in 1976 and subsequently expanded upon by philosophers such as Daniel Dennett as explanations for complex cultural activities , including human consciousness .</context>

      <context> Most recreation work calls_for a good_deal of pre planning . This is particularly true in site selection . You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed . With such a program you can make constructive <head>selections</head> of the best sites available . Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible . These are becoming more_and_more available through the work of counties and other government agencies . The new_editions of topographic maps being made by the federal_government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site .</context>

      <context> There are three principal feed_bunk types for dairy and beef_cattle : ( 1 ) Fence-line bunks - cattle eat from one side while feed is put_in from the opposite side of the fence by self unloading wagons ; ( 2 ) Mechanized bunks - they sit within the feed_lot , are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface ; ( 3 ) Special bunks - as discussed here , they permit cattle to eat from all sides . Feed is put_in with an elevator . Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed_bunk . The <head>selection</head> of materials depends_on skills of available labor for installation , cost of materials available locally , and your own preference . No one material is best for all situations . Selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem . Animals eat only from one side , so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk .</context>

With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today - and it will be tougher in_the future . Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due_to the demanding combination of qualifications called_for by this type of management work .

      <context> An aggressor would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity in a target population . A solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized .

      <context> Fourth , the two indicators are for_the_most_part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center . The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood . Onsets , Completions , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile . It may be assumed that differences in ratings due_to <head>selection</head> of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according_to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body . Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence . It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as_well_as Hand , it seems to be the method_of_choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood .</context>

Therefore , third grade children were chosen as subjects for this study . For purposes of sample <head>selection</head> only ( individual tests were given later ) we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third grade population in each school_system . The subjects for this study were randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution , one-third as underachievers , one-third medium , and one-third over-achievers . Children whose reading scores were at_least one standard_deviation below the regression_line of each total third grade school population were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection .

The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers .

      <context> An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal_systems , including some of the more unusual types . By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no_more of the range of possibilities in tone_systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour_languages . This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone . Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative <head>selection</head> of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist . Papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work . The second need is better field techniques . The great majority of present-day linguists fall_into one or more of a number of overlapping types : those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed , those who are personally scared of tone and tone_languages generally , those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter .</context>
