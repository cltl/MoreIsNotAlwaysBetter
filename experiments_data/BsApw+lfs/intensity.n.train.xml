      <context> This difference is made_up of many factors . Some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings .

Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests . Yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records .

Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in_that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) . But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel 's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student 's approach as distinctly his own . Schnabel 's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous <head>intensity</head> all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one . Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity .

      <context> This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 ) . Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 a , b , c ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 ) . In the relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave_lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 cm . The observable characteristics of planetary radio_radiation are the <head>intensity</head> , the polarization , and the direction of arrival of the waves . The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute_of_arc . This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction , and consequently the radio_emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved . It should be possible , however , to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio_sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers .</context>

      <context> A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting . In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such_as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs . The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated . Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies_in the fact that changes in the <head>intensity</head> of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity . A state of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not_only an increase in the parasympathetic reactivity this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli , but leads also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus acting sympathetically under control_conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response ! Furthermore , conditioned_reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level , and several types of behavioral changes probably related_to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observed . If , for_instance , such a change is produced by one or a_few insulin comas or electroshocks , previously inhibited conditioned_reactions reappear .</context>

Since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation , Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding . Appropriate experiments showed that this is , indeed , possible . He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses .</context>

      <context> This tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways . It is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism . Before we comment further on these pathological conditions , we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness . Thus , a low <head>intensity</head> of hypothalamic cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition . Moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induces , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous_system . With the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur . Since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep , it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus .</context>

The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit .

To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy .
