Many speculators pay little attention to the fundamental value of a security and instead focus purely on price movements .

On 3 December 2009 , Representative Peter DeFazio , who blamed " reckless speculation " for the 2008 financial crisis , proposed the introduction of a financial transaction tax , which would specifically target speculators by taxing financial market securities transactions .</context>

      <context> Certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical_Symphony seriously , and with a good_deal of pleasure . His life-long friend , Serge_Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , New_York , and Washington , D._C. , to_which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation . Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world_premiere of the Love_for_Three_Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third_Piano_Concerto . `` Uncle_Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold <head>speculations</head> and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden_Twenties '' . We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano_sonatas , chamber_music , gavottes , and marches ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities . We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers . Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms .</context>
