      <context> Most commercial beekeepers in the US are migratory , spending winter in warm climates and moving with the spring to follow the bloom <head>,</head> or pollination contracts for almonds , apples , blueberries , and other fruits and vegetables that require bees . Migratory beekeeping also is practiced in France , Australia , South Africa , Argentina , and to a lesser extent , in other nations . Some researchers suggest that snowbirds â€” Canadian and U.S. citizens who move to warmer climates during the winter â€” exhibit patterns of seasonal migration .</context>

There are a half_dozen reasons helping to account_for the <head>migration</head> to the campgrounds . Among them , according to the U._S. Department_of_Commerce , are : ( 1 ) shorter work_weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid_vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education . The more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn . Camping is family fun , and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever saw before .</context>

      <context> But I think that something more than this is involved . How did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New_England as it did in other parts of the country ? Is n't it a_bit odd that the three states of Southern New_England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode_Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A_+_M_colleges ? Was it supposed , perchance , that A_+_M ( vocational_training , that_is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant_class which flooded that part of the New_England world in the post Civil_War period , the immigrants having been brought_in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make_up for the labor shortage caused by <head>migration</head> to the West ? Is it not ironical that Roger_Williams 's state , Rhode_Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? The state universities of Maine , New_Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; they had less immigration to contend with . A Yale historian , writing a_few years ago in The Yale_Review , said : `` We in New_England have long_since segregated our children '' .</context>
