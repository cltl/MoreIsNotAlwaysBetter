It is debated whether the politicians should apply a code of ethics , or whether it is a profession entirely discretionary , just subject to compliance with the law : however , recently codes of practice have been approved in this field .</context>

      <context> If there were only the mess , all would be clear ; but there is also compassion . As a Christian , I know I do not stand where Beckett stands , but I do see much of what he sees . As a writer on the theater , I have paid close attention to the plays . Harold_Clurman is right to say that `` Waiting_for_Godot '' is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of Europe 's present politics , <head>ethic</head> , and common way_of_life '' . Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to . `` Waiting_for_Godot '' sells even better in America than in France . The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America , but it is the consciousness that most `` mature '' societies arrive_at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not strictly practical ends of culture .</context>

      <context> The religion supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values . Even in the united_states , with its freedom of religious_belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values . This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value_orientation elsewhere ; for_example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism . In America also all_of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic <head>ethic</head> which is reflective of our common religion . Even the non church_members - the freewheelers , marginal religionists and_so_on - have the values of Christian civilization internalized in them . Furthermore , religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values ; for_example , those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends . Finally , it gives sanctity , more than human legitimacy , and even , through super empirical reference , transcendent and supernatural importance to some values ; for_example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the state as a divine instrument .</context>
