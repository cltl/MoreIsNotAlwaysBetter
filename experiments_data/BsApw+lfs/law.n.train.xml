      <context> One night , so some of these theories run , Adam would have fallen_asleep , much_as he fell_asleep for the creation of Eve ; and thus he would have been carried_over into the life_eternal . The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural_order of time and change . On_the_other_hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence . It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the <head>law</head> . If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator . This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced . If death receives more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through Christ begins to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence .</context>

      <context> Recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction . He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as_well_as of mortality . Therefore Irenaeus describes man 's creation as_follows : `` So_that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted_up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take_up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a <head>law</head> was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all . And He laid_down for him certain conditions : so_that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' . These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result . There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) .</context>

That_is_to_say Gabriel 's fundamental_law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor <head>law</head> any_more . It is a weakness of Gabriel 's analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental_law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy .

      <context> As is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula . Prior to 1960 , in_order to provide matching for the minimum ( base ) allotment , State funds had to equal 1954 State funds . Prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related_to the fiscal capacity of the State , with a pivot of 40 % State ( or 60 % Federal ) participation in total program costs . The percentage of Federal participation in such costs for any State is referred to in the <head>law</head> as that State 's `` Federal share '' . For purposes of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the States `` unadjusted Federal share '' . Beginning in 1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as_required ) 25 % a_year , so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40 % pivot State share , with maximum and minimum State shares of 50 % and 30 % , respectively . The pre 1960 rate of Federal participation with_respect_to any State 's base allotment , as_well_as the adjusted rate in_effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is designated by the statute as that State 's `` adjusted Federal Share '' .</context>

      <context> Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the <head>law</head> as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis .

      <context> There were rumors that the Ministry_of_the_Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings .

It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations .

The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted . The readers of the Providence_Daily_Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old_Brown '' had a fair trial . Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her <head>laws</head> , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' . In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical .

However , the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever . The new interchange among the four Los_Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square_mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller_Center in New_York . It is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the <head>law</head> calls `` the highest and best use '' of centrally located urban land . As it affects the city 's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . Subways improved land values without taking_away land ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by_a_long_shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed . Downtown Los_Angeles is already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking_lot and garage - one of those preposterous `` if '' statistics has already come to pass .</context>
