      <context> It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel_de_Cervantes ' `` Don_Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide_screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth_Street and Sixty-eighth_Street_Playhouses . More_than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho_Panza , in seventeenth century Spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . Nikolai_Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander_Nevsky and Ivan_the_Terrible , performs the lanky Don_Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . His addle-brained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous <head>code</head> of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no_doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues . Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do . He treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect . Directed by Grigory_Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world .</context>

      <context> He is , first_and_foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society . It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts_for the great appeal of the mythological detective . By_virtue_of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private_eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle_class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let_the_devil_take_the_hindmost . At_the_same_time , because the personal <head>code</head> of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle_class eyes a virtuous man .

      <context> One would need_to test this proposition carefully ; after_all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) Reader 's Digest literature on the `` most unforgettable character I ever met '' deals with village grocers , country_doctors , favorite if illiterate aunts , and_so_forth . Scientists often turn_out to be idiosyncratic , too . But still , the proposition is worth examination . It is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some <head>code</head> of `` right '' and `` wrong '' . I do not know that this is true ; both Flugel and Ranyard_West deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologians as Niebuhr and Buber .

Still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one 's ideas of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic_books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of_this influence . Probably the most important thing to focus_on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the <head>code</head> which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available . This is in large part a code_of_behavior and a glossary of values : what is it that people do and should do and_how one should regard it . In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint . Literature may be said to give people a sense_of_purpose , dedication , mission , significance .</context>
