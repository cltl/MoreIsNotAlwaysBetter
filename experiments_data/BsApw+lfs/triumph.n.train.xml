      <context> Three were doubles , Brooks_Robinson getting a pair and Marv_Breeding one . Bill_Kunkel , Bob_Hartman and Ed_Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West_Palm_Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami_Stadium . The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took_over in the top of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee_Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning appearance , and merited the <head>triumph</head> . Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . Whitey_Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base_on_balls .</context>

      <context> End Gene_Raesz , who broke a hand in the Owl 's game with LSU , was back working_out with Rice_Monday , and John_Nichols , sophomore guard , moved_back into action after a week 's idleness with an ankle injury . The Texas_Aggies got a day_off Monday - a special gift from Coach Jim_Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night , but Myers announced that halfback George_Hargett , shaken_up in the Tech game , would not play against Trinity Saturday . Halfback Bud_Priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly mending sprained ankle , joined TCU 's workout Monday . The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American_Football_League starts - a 19 - 12 <head>triumph</head> over the Denver_Broncos - but their visit will be a short one . The Texans have two more road_games - at Buffalo and Houston - before they play for the home_folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank_Stram 's men will meet the Bills just_as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings . Buffalo coach Buster_Ramsey , who has become one of the game 's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex National_Football_Leaguers , M._C._Reynolds and Warren_Rabb . Rabb , the former Louisiana_State field_general , came_off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22 - 12 upset victory over the Houston_Oilers , defending league champions .</context>

      <context> In the third Frank_Robinson hammered a long home_run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on . Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball_game , trailing only 6 - 3 , but the drive fizzled when John_Edwards fouled_out with men on second and third and two out . In the fifth , Wally_Post slashed a 2 - run homer off Bud_Daley , but by that time the score was 11 - 5 and it really did n't matter . The Yankee <head>triumph</head> made Ralph_Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World_Series victory in his first year as a manager . Only Bucky_Harris , the `` boy manager '' of Washington in 1924 , and Eddie_Dyer of the St._Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat .</context>

      <context> A year later they were 4 - 13 . Since 1949 , the St._Louis club has been below .500 on May 1 just four times . The '49 team was off to a so-so 5 - 5 beginning , then fell as low as 12 - 17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories . The '52 Cards were 6 - 7 on May 1 but ended with 88 <head>triumphs</head> , the club 's top since 1949 . Then last season the_Birds tumbled as low as 11 - 18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . Since 1949 , the only National_League club that got_off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team . Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 .</context>

      <context> State_Department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary , and driving two blocks into East_Berlin under military escort , will not avail . Tanks lined_up at the border will be no_more helpful . The materials for compromise are at_hand : The Nation , Walter_Lippmann and other sober commentators ( see Alan_Clark on p. 367 ) have spelled them out again_and_again . A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of <head>triumph</head> , but it will save Berlin . Or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence , if that is what the West wants . The removal of Stalin 's body from the mausoleum he shared with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in the Kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history . It is , in_fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead .</context>

      <context> `` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' . Morrison points_out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet_Union or Red_China , it is the most vulnerable of the great_powers - Europe of_course must be written_off out_of_hand . He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United_States is the least risky path our government can take . His proposal is opposed to that of Richard_Nixon , Governor_Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic_Energy_Commission , Dr._Edward_Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of <head>triumph</head> in the exacerbation of the cold_war . These gentlemen are calling_for a resumption of testing - in the atmosphere - on the greatest possible scale , all in_the_name_of national security . Escalation is their first love and their last ; they will be faithful unto death . Capable as their minds may be in some directions , these guardians of the nation 's security are incapable of learning , or even of observing .</context>

      <context> The sound may be good ; but if you know The Real_Thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation . Command 's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one . Like the recent Scheherazade from London ( High_Fidelity , Sept. 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather_than on creating sensational effects . Because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers ' <head>triumph</head> . The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values . The engineering as_such never obtrudes_upon your consciousness . The effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance .</context>

      <context> By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ; he collapses , and dies . In the work of every artist , I suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about ; not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image , a single moment . So here . The horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone_wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed_up as a whore dressing_up as a baby ; the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; the bringing_together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering '' ) ; the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant - all this seems a <head>triumph</head> of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ; beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann 's work . When I try to work_out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , I come_up with the following ideas , which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay . Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann 's heroes . The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns_on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love .</context>

      <context> But Mercer 's explanation was simple : `` I made_out the check and carried it around a_few days unsigned - in_case I lost it '' . When he remembered that he might have not signed the check , Mercer made_out another for the same amount , instructing the bank to destroy the other - especially if he had happened_to have absent-mindedly signed both of them . When the family business failed , Mercer left school and on his mother 's urging - for she hoped that he would become an actor - he joined a local little theater group . When the troupe traveled_to New_York to participate in a one act play competition - and won - Mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in <head>triumph</head> , remained in New_York . He had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah . But Mercer hung_on , living , after_a_fashion , in a Greenwich_Village fourth flight walk-up . `` The place had no sink or washbasin , only a bathtub '' , his mother discovered when she visited him .</context>

      <context> It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions . Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church - his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career - but for the one clear victory he had talked_about to the colonel . He was not sure how much of this desire was_due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego , demanding to be satisfied , for the two were intertwined and could not be separated . He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated , the Communists in the village rooted_out , the mission standing triumphant , for in the <head>triumph</head> of the Lord he himself would be triumphant , too . But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan , that man 's ambition when linked with God would be a driving , indefatigable force for good in the world . He sighed . How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice .</context>

She would have said <head>triumph</head> . Then Angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen . Jessica_Packard lifted her head and followed the retreating figure , her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips . For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; then she snorted and groped_for her fork .</context>
