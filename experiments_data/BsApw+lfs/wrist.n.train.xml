      <context> A man has 32 souls , one for each part of the body . Those souls like to wander off , and must be called back . With the divinities present and our souls in_place , we were wished health , happiness , and power . Then , one_after_another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our <head>wrists</head> . These were to be kept on , to hold_in the 32 souls . As we stepped_out into the sunlight , a man came_up_to John_Cool and silently showed him his hand . It had a festering hole as big as a silver_dollar .</context>

      <context> First , the upper portion requires series of films for every child , consisting_of those from Hand , Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , and Foot . The lower portion necessitates only films of Hand . Second , the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round_bones of the five regions . The lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round_bones predominantly , since only two long_bones are included in Hand and <head>Wrist</head> as a region . Third , the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level , Onset and Completion . The lower portion utilizes the full_complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as_well_as their Onset and Completion . Fourth , the two indicators are for_the_most_part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center .</context>

      <context> In France he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown up to the sky , and always as he wandered , he felt a stranger to their exultation . They were poems in a strange language , of which he could barely touch a meaning - enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sensed there . Brittany , that stone-gray mystery through which he traveled for thirty days , sleeping in the barns of farmers or alongside roads , had worked some subtle change in him , he knew , and it was in Brittany that he had met Pierre . Pierre had no hands ; they had been severed at the <head>wrists</head> . With leather cups fitted in his handlebars , he steered his bicycle . He and Warren had traveled together for four days . They visited the shipyards at Brest and Pierre had_to sign the register , vouching for the integrity of the visiting foreigner .</context>

      <context> Then she went_back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water . `` My nephews will be coming_down '' , she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining_room , the whole meal on a vast linen covered tray . She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years ; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had faded to a near absence of color which had , possibly from her constant looking_at the water , something of the light of the sea in them . Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark <head>wrist</head> drew_off the cloth . She smiled , and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face . `` That will be so nice for you , Mrs._Packard '' , she said . Her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in Sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose .</context>

He saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her <head>wrist</head> . `` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now . `` I 've had enough of_that .
