      <context> Nakamura ( ' 58 ) , Verloop ( ' 48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ( ' 50 ) , von_Hayek ( ' 53 ) , and Tobin ( ' 52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human_being . Miller ( ' 50 ) is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint . In criticism of the latter 's views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all_of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level . As early as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial_artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary_artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial_artery flow would occur in response to a relative <head>drop</head> in pulmonary_artery pressure . Berry , Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this . Our own studies in which bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by injecting the bronchial_artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary_artery or vein , and then by injecting the pulmonary_artery and vein afterwards . It is distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence , uninjectable .</context>
