      <context> One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite . Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy . The London_Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping_out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one_hundred years . With traditional nationalistic spirit , some Englishmen <head>claim</head> that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best . I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics . It has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses at Mass . They hope , of_course , to reclaim the non-Catholic population to the Catholic faith , and at every Sunday Benediction they recite by_heart the `` Prayer_for_England '' :</context>

      <context> This recording surely belongs in everyone 's collection . Must records always sound like records ? From the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real_Thing have regularly been put in circulation . Seen in perspective , many_of these releases have a genuine <head>claim</head> to be milestones . Although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original . On the basis of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal under Karl_Muck 's baton , or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini created in his years with the New_York_Philharmonic . Since the concept of high_fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold .</context>

      <context> You may find certain coverage costing much more_than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions . Check to see if some of your benefits - such_as on-the-job disability pay - can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you .

      <context> In_the_first_place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale . Robert_Frost , for_instance , writes about rural life in New_England , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems . This has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk_poet '' , simply because he is a rural one . In the second place , a large_number of writers , making a more direct <head>claim</head> than Frost to being `` folk_writers '' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material . Stephen_Vincent_Benet 's John_Brown's_Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John_Steinbeck 's The_Grapes_of_Wrath and Carl_Sandburg 's The_People,_Yes . The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass . Folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it .</context>

His unsuccessful strivings to give_up drink are represented as religious strivings ; he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe Praisegod_Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue - and still in_the_end capitulated '' . The cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic Life , `` blithe and carefree '' . `` He made no <head>claims</head> to belong_to the great and mighty of this earth '' . Piepsam is grotesque , a disturbing parody ; his end is ridiculous and trivial . He is `` a man raving_mad on_the_way to the churchyard '' .

      <context> The historian 's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them . It is a characteristic of thoughts that , in re-thinking them we come , ipso_facto , to understand why they were thought '' . Such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition . `` History has this in_common with every other science : that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his <head>claim</head> by exhibiting to himself in_the_first_place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based . This is what was meant , above , by describing history as inferential . The knowledge in_virtue_of_which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events '' . It is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by_no_means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research .</context>

      <context> Wage price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces - no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage price behavior of a_few very important industries . While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular <head>claim</head> of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United_States since World_War_2 , . Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here presented . The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price_competition , but which is so basic that its wage price policies are held in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands .</context>

      <context> One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded_as the law_of_nations . Admiralty_law , the law_merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law_of_Nations and made dependent_on the several national laws . Private international_law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international_law proper , or , as it is often called , public international_law . States were free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , their own rules as_to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law_merchant , and to enact legislation with regard_to many <head>claims</head> arising on the high_seas . The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in_fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations .</context>

      <context> All_around the Mediterranean_Sea , Asia_Minor , northern India , and Tibet , Hebrew was the native tongue . In southern Europe , between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic_speaking peoples of northern Europe , was a thin but long stretch of territory called March . This was no_man's_land , disputed by the Haijac_Union and the Israeli_Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years . Neither nation would give_up their <head>claim</head> on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic_War . So , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own borders ) . Its citizens spoke all_of the world 's surviving tongues , plus a new one called Lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet_of_paper . Hal saw in his mind the rest of Earth : Iceland , Greenland , the Caribbean_Islands , and the eastern half of South_America .</context>
