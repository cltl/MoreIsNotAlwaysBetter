      <context> `` This is one of the major items in the Fulton_County general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the State_Welfare_Department `` has seen_fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton_County , which receives none of_this money . The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' . Nevertheless , `` we feel that in_the_future Fulton_County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said . `` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate <head>burden</head> '' on Fulton taxpayers . The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary 's court which has been under_fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation . The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating_procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand_juries , the Atlanta_Bar_Association and an interim citizens_committee . `` These actions should serve to protect in_fact and in_effect the court 's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said .</context>

      <context> It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment . He may have_to depend_upon custom service for specialized operations , such_as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have_to wait his turn .

This may be true whether the farm is owned or rented . If the farm is rented , the rent must be paid . If it is owned , taxes must be paid , and if the place is not free_of mortgage , there will be interest and payments on the principal to take_care of .</context>

      <context> When you see them again give them my love - not best respects now , but love by God '' . William_R._Stillwell , an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the Georgia_Department_of_Archives_and_History , liked to tease his wife in his letters . After he had been away from home about a year he wrote : `` [ Dear Wife ] If I did not write and receive letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married I do n't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar_as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as I am so forgitful '' . A Yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote : `` I am growing so fat I am a <head>burden</head> 2 myself '' . Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer : `` Now I lay me down to sleep , The gray-backs o ' er my body creep ; If they should bite before I wake , I pray the Lord their jaws to break '' `` . Charles_Thiot , a splendid Georgia soldier , differed from most_of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of_age .</context>

      <context> Well , after everybody has followed the New_England pattern of segregating one 's children into private_schools , only the poor folks are left . And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction . A dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew_up in the South and has spent many years in New_England , said to me not_long ago : `` I can n't forgive New_England for rejecting all complicity '' . Being a teacher of American literature , I remembered Whittier 's `` Massachusetts_to_Virginia '' , where he said : `` But that one dark loathsome <head>burden</head> ye must stagger with alone , And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown '' . There is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his `` English_Notebooks '' . and one finds it again in Thomas_Nelson_Page ) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves . Whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value .</context>

      <context> It is the concern of the Department_of_State that the American people are safe and secure - defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department_of_Defense . It is also the concern of the Department_of_State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active - this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department_of_Commerce . We can no_longer rely_on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments . Assistant_Secretaries_of_State will now carry an increased <head>burden</head> of active formulation and coordination of policies . Means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign_policy . I think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action . Every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer .</context>

      <context> In their book American_Skyline , Christopher_Tunnard and Henry_Hope_Reed argue that Franklin_Roosevelt 's New_Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility - a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote . The first superhighways - New_York 's Henry_Hudson and Chicago 's Lake_Shore , San_Francisco 's Bay_Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania_Turnpike - were built as part of the federal works_program which was going_to cure the depression . At_the_same_time , Roosevelt 's Federal_Housing_Administration , coupled with Henry_Morgenthau 's cheap-money policy , permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes . Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U._S. government ; householders who had been unable to pick_up the <head>burden</head> of short-term high interest mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per_cent , under government aegis .</context>

      <context> So_much_for the tiresome facts , as familiar to you , I'm sure , as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake . The foregoing , aided by several clues I 'll withhold to keep you on_your_toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of Inspector_Javert , but before they close_in , gird yourselves , I repeat , for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless . Fourteen of the sculptures you took posses properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls_out in patches . In_time , these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce , riddling you with frambesia , the king's_evil , sheep_rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence becomes a <head>burden</head> and you cry_out_for release . All this , though , is simply a prelude , a curtain-raiser , for what ensues , and I doubt whether any Occidental could accurately forecast it . If , however , it would help to intensify your anguish , I can delimit the powers of a_few of the divinities you 've affronted and describe the punishment they meted_out in one analogous instance . Hold_on tight .</context>
