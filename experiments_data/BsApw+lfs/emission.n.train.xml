      <context> Measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth . There have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation . The measurements made with the NRL 50 - foot reflector , which is altitude azimuth mounted , would have shown a systematic change with local hour_angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized . Recent interferometer measurements ( Radhakrishnan and Roberts , 1960 ) have shown the 960 - Mc <head>emission</head> of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate_in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk . Other_than this very significant result , most_of the information now available about the radio_emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation . The concept of apparent black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets . The received radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical black-body which subtends the same solid_angle as the visible disk of the planet .</context>

      <context> Mare_Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it . These contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio_brightness with latitude . Very recently , observations have been made at 8 - mm wave_length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2 ' ( Amenitskii , Noskova , and Salomonovich , 1960 ) . The constant temperature contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm by Coates ( 1959 a ) , and apparently the <head>emission</head> at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features . Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave_lengths in_order_that the radio_emission of the moon can be properly interpreted . The observations of Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described . Measurements at 3.15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 to June 19 , 1956 , using the 50 - foot reflector at the U.S._Naval_Research_Laboratory in Washington .</context>

      <context> No attempts to measure the radio_emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small diameters , or low_temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave_lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity . In_spite of this , the very large radio_reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio_emission of most of the planets in a_few years . The study of the radio_emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25 - cm wave_length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 ) . This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25 - cm <head>emission</head> of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) . They deduced from their measurements that the radio_emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less_than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared_emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio_emission came about 3 - 1 2 days after Full_Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared_emission , which reaches its maximum at Full_Moon . Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing_out that rocklike materials which are likely to make_up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio_waves , although opaque to infrared_radiation . The infrared_emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due_to solar_radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase .</context>

The infrared_emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due_to solar_radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase . Since the absorption of radio_waves in rocklike material varies with wave_length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material . The radio_emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when Burke and Franklin ( 1955 ) identified the origin of interference like radio_noise on their records at about 15 meters wave_length as <head>emission</head> from Jupiter . This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 ) . Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 a , b , c ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 ) . In the relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave_lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 cm .</context>
