The Serge_Prokofieff whom we knew in the United_States_of_America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur - and very capable as a professional musician . These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post World_War_1 , era .

Prokofieff 's Classical_Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well trained musician still in his twenties .

We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers . Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich <head>America</head> - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms . So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting_grounds of `` Uncle_Sam '' ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought .

I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention . You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment - I certainly do - but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United_States not_only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U._S. - Soviet relations for the foreseeable future .

The other charge was that <head>America</head> 's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years . The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world_affairs can quarrel with it .

      <context> In a book review of `` The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State_Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West_Contacts_Staff in_order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy_and_Bess ' overrode the State_Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz_musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo_montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry_Ford , Hugh_Cooper , Thomas_Campbell , the International_Harvester_Co. , and David_W._Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of <head>America</head> in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' . Perhaps the public 's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no_more exists in America . In his stead is a milquetoast version known_as `` the corporation '' . But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ; and our loss of `` prestige '' abroad is the direct result .</context>

      <context> The religion supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values . Even in the united_states , with its freedom of religious_belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values . This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value_orientation elsewhere ; for_example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism . In <head>America</head> also all_of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common religion . Even the non church_members - the freewheelers , marginal religionists and_so_on - have the values of Christian civilization internalized in them . Furthermore , religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values ; for_example , those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends . Finally , it gives sanctity , more than human legitimacy , and even , through super empirical reference , transcendent and supernatural importance to some values ; for_example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the state as a divine instrument .</context>

      <context> A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and <head>America</head> , broke this unity and this universality . It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action . To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy .</context>

      <context> If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children 's clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too_much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount_business in big-ticket items . Department_stores were built_on dry_goods , especially ladies ' fashions , and in this area , in_the_long_run , the suburban branches will be hard_put to compete against downtown . If this analysis is correct , the suburban branches will turn_out to be what management 's cost_accountants refuse to acknowledge , marginal operations rather_than major factors . Historically in <head>America</head> the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered . `` How ya gonna keep ' em down on the farm '' ? was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree .
