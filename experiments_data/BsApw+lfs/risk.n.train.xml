      <context> Risk <head>of</head> infection is a nursing diagnosis which is defined as " the state in which an individual is at risk to be invaded by an opportunistic or pathogenic agent ( virus , fungus , bacteria , protozoa , or other parasite ) from endogenous or exogenous sources " and was approved by NANDA in 1986 . Although anyone can become infected by a pathogen , patients with this diagnosis are at an elevated risk and extra infection controls should be considered . The risk of infection depends on a number of endogenous sources .</context>

      <context> There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world . by analogy , the church also has been regarded_as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in_order to be the church . But , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a_fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God 's providence , presents it . And yet this is exactly the <head>risk</head> we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men . Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends . In arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ; and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set_forth reasons to justify such a conviction . But the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable .</context>

      <context> So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard_to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation 's needs for survival . The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society . Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society . Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and <head>risk</head> for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by_any_means other_than the corporate form , e._g. constructing major airports or dams . Thus , if corporations are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject_to public control and needs . In all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services . Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human_beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests .</context>

      <context> Two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time . One , a reservation on the point I have just made , is the phenomenon of pseudo thinking , pseudo feeling , and pseudo willing , which Fromm discussed in The_Escape_from_Freedom . In_essence this involves grounding one 's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather_than in one 's own values and experience . There is a <head>risk</head> that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else . Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important . Moreover , if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo thinking ; if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity . The second timely part of_this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary_works and the ephemeral mass_culture products of today .</context>

      <context> So would radar picket_ships . A squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task_forces . Three requirements go_with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; and it must be enforced without discrimination . Once these conditions of international_law are met , countries that try to run to blockade do so at their own <head>risk</head> . Blockade runners can be stopped - by gunfire , if necessary - searched and held , at_least temporarily . They could be sent to U._S. ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated .

      <context> It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a <head>risk</head> , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins ' pronouncement in Pleas_of_the_Crown from a metaphysical point_of_view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married_couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such_that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal_law as if there were no marriage . By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself .</context>
