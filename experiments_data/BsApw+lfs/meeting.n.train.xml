      <context> the success of Communism 's war against the West does not depend_on such spectacular and definitive conquests . Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence . Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages . Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant - in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine <head>meetings</head> of undercover conspirators , at the United_Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences - preferably at the highest level . The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first_step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West . Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country . The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in_fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy .</context>

      <context> From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government . Until the Charter_of_Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes . The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 , but the P.D.I. ( Parti_Democratique_de_l'Independance ) , the most important minor party at the time , objected to the Istiqlal 's predominance in the civil_service and influence in Radio_Maroc . There were rumors that the Ministry_of_the_Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned <head>meetings</head> . The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be supported by the King himself .

      <context> I made inquiries , I read a book of etiquette . In December I wrote her with_authority that we would meet on the steps of the Hotel_Astor , a rendezvous spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated . We would attend a film and , later_on , I stated , we might go to the Mayflower_Coffee_Shop or Child 's or Toffenetti 's for waffles . I set the hour of our <head>meeting</head> for seven . At five o'clock that night it was already dark , and behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a groom . I wore a new double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapels like a devil 's ears . My camp made leather wallet , bulky with twisted , raised stitches around the edges , I stuffed with money I had been saving .</context>

      <context> Suppose her father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave ? Suppose at this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans ? I grew uneasy . All about me there was a hectic interplay of <head>meetings</head> taking_place , like abrupt , jerky scenes in old silent_movies , joyous greetings and beginnings , huggings and kissings , enthusiastic forays into the festive night . Whole platoons were taking_up new positions on the steps , arriving and departing , while I stayed glued , like a signpost , to one spot . At 7 : 25 two hotel doormen came thumping down the steps , carrying a saw-horse to be set_up as a barricade in_front_of the haberdashery_store window next to the entranceway , and as I watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground , their golden , fringed epaulets and spic , red visored caps , I suddenly saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making her way through the crowd . My heart almost stopped beating .</context>

      <context> On the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests ; the scene looked_like a Christmas_card . On the third floor one of the two windows was lighted ; it was framed in maroon drapes , and no faces were visible . This would be Mahzeer 's office . He and the prime_minister would be back from the window , seated at Mahzeer 's desk ; they would be going_over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a <head>meeting</head> . In a minute , or five minutes , the business would be done ; Mahzeer would stand_up , the prime_minister would follow . Mahzeer would direct the prime_minister 's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and_then step to one side . The single shot would come ; Hoag would carry its sound to his grave .</context>

      <context> He slumped against a log fence_rail , then tried to lift himself . Two more shots followed in quick succession , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground . An inquest was held , and after a good_deal of testimony about the anonymous notes , the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards . Rumors of the offer Tom_Horn had made at the Stockgrowers'_Association <head>meeting</head> had leaked_out by then , and as a grand_jury investigation of the murder got underway , the prosecuting_attorney , a Colonel_Baird , ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning . It took some time to locate Horn . He was finally found in the Bates_Hole region of Natrona_County , two counties away . Prosecutor_Baird immediately assumed he was hiding_out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment .</context>

      <context> `` I do n't mind at_all '' , he said , delighted with her attention . Changing his clothes , he put_on his dark-blue flannel suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for_good . But it was a hopeful sign , he told himself . She no_longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their <head>meeting</head> that first night in Parioli . That day they loafed around , just getting the feel of the city . They looked at the ruins of the old Roman wall on the lower Via_Veneto , then they went_to the Farnese_Gardens . She had some amusing scandal about the Farneses in the old days .</context>

      <context> Carpenters all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's_son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working_on the school job . There was a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way . Nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going_to be taken drunk . Mr._Crumb would probably see him at Lodge <head>Meeting</head> the next night . If he was sober , which was doubtful , he 'd have him get_in_touch with Mr._Crombie . Mr._Blatz had been at_least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned_out to be the greatest boon that had come into Mr._Crombie 's life since he moved to Highfield , in_spite_of the fact that he did n't work very fast or very long at_a_time , and he did n't like to work at_all unless Mr._Crombie hung_around and talked to him . He said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they was n't nobody with you .</context>
