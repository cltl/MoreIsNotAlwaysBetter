      <context> While it might be expected that it is preferable to keep one ’s options open , research <head>has</head> shown that having the opportunity to revise one ’s decisions leaves people less satisfied with the decision outcome . A recent study found that participants experienced higher regret after having made a reversible decision . The results suggest that reversible decisions cause people to continue to think about the still relevant choice options , which might increase dissatisfaction with the decision and regret .</context>

Further research has expanded on choice overload , suggesting that there is a paradox of choice . As increasing options are available , three problems emerge .</context>

      <context> Others say that there is never too much choice and that there is a difference between happiness and satisfaction : a <head>person</head> who tries to find better decisions will often be dissatisfied , but not necessarily unhappy since his attempts at finding better choices did improve his lifestyle ( even if it was n't the best decision he will continually try to incrementally improve the decisions he takes ) . Choice architecture is the process of encouraging people to make good choices through grouping and ordering the decisions in a way that maximizes successful choices and minimizes the number of people who become so overwhelmed by complexity that they abandon the attempt to choose . Generally , success is improved by presenting the smaller or simpler choices first , and by choosing and promoting sensible default options .</context>

      <context> If the arrival at a choice includes more <head>complex</head> motivators , cognition , instinct and feeling can become more intertwined . Most people regard having choices as a good thing , though a severely limited or artificially restricted choice can lead to discomfort with choosing , and possibly an unsatisfactory outcome . In contrast , a choice with excessively numerous options may lead to confusion , regret of the alternatives not taken , and indifference in an unstructured existence ; and the illusion that choosing an object or a course leads necessarily to control of that object or course can cause psychological problems .</context>
