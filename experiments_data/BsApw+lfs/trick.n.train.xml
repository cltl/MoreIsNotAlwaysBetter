Many magical routines use combinations of effects .

      <context> A special type is misère games , which are usually variants of <head>positive</head> games which can only be won by not winning a single trick .

      <context> In many games such as Hearts and Oh Hell , all players play individually <head>against</head> each other , but in other games there are fixed or varying partnerships . In some contract/auction games for three or more players , e.g. most Tarot variants , the contractor ( declarer or taker ) plays alone against all opponents , who form an ad hoc partnership ( the defenders ) . In some games the contractor forms a partnership with the winner of the first trick , or with the player who holds a certain card .</context>

In some games , in addition to or separately from a trump suit , certain fixed cards are always the highest trumps , e.g. the Jacks in Skat , the Jacks or Jokers in Euchre , the Rook Bird card in Rook , or the Fool in certain Tarot games .

      <context> `` To get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments Dr._Schillinger of the Lincoln_Institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps . He must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish . He must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding '' ' . Too many husbands , Dr._Schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they 're doing '' , and fear that their success depends_on some <head>trick</head> or technique of sexual play .</context>

      <context> The `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to_be_sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo . In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film . Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time . This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician 's <head>tricks</head> produced on film . It was Porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued . The movie was The Great_Train_Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all_but incalculable . Overnight , for_one_thing , Porter 's film multiplied the standard running_time of movies by ten .</context>

      <context> From above one could only occasionally catch_a_glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block . That was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch . Another had ended before it began . Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ; the <head>tricks</head> that time plays_with memory and memory with time are queerest of all . From maturity one looks_back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large . In a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a_lot of water ; the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it . Time in the sum is nothing .</context>

      <context> It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it brings_together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious , riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for Mann 's work . The wife , Amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` bird like brain '' . La^utner , for his part , `` belonged_to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in_order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so_far not fulfilled : `` They will be destroyed '' . The <head>trick</head> these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as_well . His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other_than abasement and humiliation . At_the_same_time the multiple transvestitism involved - the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby - touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby 's , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life . The music which La^utner has composed for this episode is for_the_most_part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' .</context>

The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda . They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie 's fire , rolled and lighted brown paper cigarettes , lounged_about . There was some idle_talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day 's drive .</context>

When he had left , I could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index_finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . The children loathed him , too . This_evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds_and_ends of dessert distributed over them .</context>
