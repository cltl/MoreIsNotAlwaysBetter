      <context> Consumer communities have suffered at_the_hands_of the productive interests . Negroes , Puerto_Ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities . Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century . The identification of the basic unit of religious organization - the parish or congregation - with a residential area is self_defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the <head>closing</head> of an iron_trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation . Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle_classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion . This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches . It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle_classes .</context>

      <context> The element is inserted in the discharge circuit in_place_of the exploding wire , and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy . This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element . A high-speed shutter has been developed in_order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion . The shutter consists_of two parts : a fast opening part and a fast <head>closing</head> part . Using Edgerton 's method , the fast closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires . The fast opening of the shutter consists_of a piece of aluminum_foil ( approximately * * f ) placed directly in_front of the camera_lens so that no light may pass into the camera . The opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil .</context>
