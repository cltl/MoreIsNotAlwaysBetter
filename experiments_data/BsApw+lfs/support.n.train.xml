Rep._Mac_Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal <head>support</head> for public education , provided_that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would_like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution .

      <context> The Presto ma_non_assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real Allegro_con_spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet . In_the_end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings . Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at_times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song . The engineering provides exactly the <head>support</head> needed for such a result . Too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment . The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration .

      <context> The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman .

SAAMI 's financial <head>support</head> since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach .

The following table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , appropriations , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching_funds for this part of the grant program .

The Act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State . It stipulates , in_addition , that all amounts remaining as_a_result_of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums . These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per_capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State .</context>

There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa_constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda ) .

If , in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet .</context>

      <context> The local Istiqlal and U.M.C.I.A. offices did not campaign and lost heavily . The value of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as shown in Table /1 , . The chamber_of_Commerce elections were , of_course , an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections . The U.N.F.P. learned that its urban organization , which depends heavily on U.M.T. <head>support</head> , was most effective . The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete , precise problems of internal politics .

A second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections .</context>

      <context> The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called_in and notices of further investigation appeared from_time_to_time . In January , 1958 , the Minister_of_the_Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied . In late 1957 the M.P. ( Mouvement_Populaire ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council_of_Government under Balafrej was formed without <head>support</head> from progressive elements in the party . The parties were on_the_whole unprepared for elections , while the people were still experiencing post independence let-down and suffering the after_effects of poor harvests in 1957 . Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue . They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held .</context>

      <context> Another problem is who will pay for the training . Local school districts are hard_pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training . Programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business_leaders demand it . Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local <head>support</head> for training unless a new industry is in_sight and requests it . State_governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational_schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities . Only the Federal_government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs . If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states .</context>

      <context> However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment . Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . This probably would require some <head>support</head> for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment_compensation or a Youth_Conservation_Corps . A maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from home . A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor . Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training .</context>

      <context> During the latter days of November to the day of Brown 's execution , it seems that most Rhode_Islanders did not concur in `` E._B. 's '' suggestion . On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown 's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions . A week later the Daily_Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John_Brown on the day of his execution . The editor of the Daily_Journal warned , `` that if such a demonstration be made , it will not find <head>support</head> or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak_for Providence '' . The Providence_Daily_Post 's editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be held in Providence .
