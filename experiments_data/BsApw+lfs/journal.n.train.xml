      <context> A plain <head>bearing</head> ( in railroading sometimes called a solid bearing ) is the simplest type of bearing , comprising just a bearing surface and no rolling elements .

      <context> What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months ? What happened to the fourteen missing men ?

All_told , they offered a highly confused picture . But since 1927 , researchers digging_into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information . Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage .</context>

      <context> On the third voyage , a near mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew_members on the Half_Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in mid Atlantic .

The mate , Robert_Juet , who had kept the <head>journal</head> on the half_Moon , was experienced - but he was a bitter old_man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity . Philip_Staffe , the ship 's carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent . Arnold_Lodley and Michael_Perse were like the rest - lukewarm , ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis .

      <context> Among us , we three handled quite a few small commissions , from spot drawings for advertising_agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs . Each of us had his own specialty besides . George did wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out of a medieval miniature : hundreds of delicate details crammed into an eight by ten sheet and looking as if they had been done under a jeweler's_glass . He also drew precise crisp spots , which he sold to various literary and artistic <head>journals</head> , The New_Yorker , for_instance , or Esquire . I did book_jackets and covers for paperback reprints : naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , daring the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt_sleeves clutching a revolver . The book could be The_Brothers_Karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket illustration . I remember once I did a jacket for Magpie_Press ; the book was a fine historical novel about Edward_3 , , and I did a week of research to get the details just_right : the fifteenth century armor , furnishings , clothes .</context>
