      <context> The medical title of `` Lobar_Ventilation_in_Man '' by Drs._C._J._Martin and A._C._Young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process . At the University_of_Washington_Medical_School , the electronics group has developed the `` Respiratory_Gas_Analyzer '' shown in Fig. 3 . This unit , affectionately dubbed `` The_Monster '' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient 's breathing . In the lower center rack an 8 - channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon_dioxide and <head>nitrogen</head> from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with_respect_to each_other . Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing_still , or in some other medically significant position . From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail . The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today 's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat .</context>

      <context> Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 * * f and at pressures up_to 250 atm , an overload of 300 psi , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at_most , one millimeter_of_mercury . A 6 - year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed . This project was carried_out under sponsorship of the Ballistic_Missile_Division_of_the_Air_Research_and_Development_Command , U._S._Air_Force , and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat_energy of chemical binding . A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more_than unity in the <head>nitrogen</head> dissociation region . Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present . The results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1000 to 10000 * * f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from * * f to * * f times normal density . In March , 1961 , representatives of the national laboratories of Australia , Canada , The_Netherlands , United_Kingdom , U._S._S._R. , United_States , and West_Germany , met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 * * f .</context>

      <context> Second_moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration . Corrections were applied for modulation broadening , apparatus background , and field shift . Spectra were obtained over the temperature range of 77 - 294 ` K . For the low-temperature measurements the sample was cooled by a cold <head>nitrogen</head> gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and Eades . The temperature was maintained to within about **f for the period_of_time required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour ) . One sample , which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375 ` C , showed the presence of adsorbed water ( about 0.3 wt % ) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room_temperature and which disappeared , due_to broadening , at low_temperature . The data reported here are either from spectra from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples evacuated and sealed_off at 375 ` C which contain no adsorbed water .</context>
