It is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the I._Q. .

      <context> His first conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on Ath. and Yok . ) was partially positive .

Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an <head>index</head> of persistence , which weights not_only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative_frequency . Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is : stem identical in 8 languages , 100 % ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86 % ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , 64 % ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57 % . His formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material . But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; and Gleason presumably is on_the_way with a further contribution in this area .</context>
