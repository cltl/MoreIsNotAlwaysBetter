      <context> In 1952 , it will be remembered , the G._O._P. without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly . All_of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you . But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common_man , to point_up what happened to him under Eisenhower 's leadership . A perceptive <head>journalist</head> , Sam_Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as The Revolt Of The Moderates . He opens his discourse , however , with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age . The show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny . Lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue .</context>

      <context> Arthur_Hays_Sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement . I am pleased to note that Mr._Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman_of_the_board of the New_York_Times . Mr._Sulzberger 's successor as publisher is Mr._Orvil_E._Dryfoos , who is president of the New_York_Times_Co. , and who has been with the Times since 1942 . Mr._Dryfoos ' outstanding career as a <head>journalist</head> guarantees that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world 's great newspapers will be maintained . I am also pleased to note that Mr._John_B._Oakes , a member of the Times staff since 1946 , has been appointed as editorial page editor . Mr._Oakes succeeds Charles_Merz , editor since 1938 , who now becomes editor emeritus . I should_like at this time , Mr._Speaker , to pay warm tribute to Arthur_Hays_Sulzberger and Charles_Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism .</context>

      <context> Not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese . In news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs . `` While Henry_Morgan was escorting Miss_Vera_Green from the church social last Saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit Mr._Morgan on the public_square '' . Such items recall the California <head>journalist</head> who reported an accident involving a movie_star : `` The area in which Miss_N - was injured is spectacularly scenic '' . The double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gags of Weber and Fields . When a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus , he replied , `` No , it was in the stomach '' . Strangely_enough , this always brought_the_house_down .</context>

      <context> Ben_Franklin said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr._Fogg . You explain English by Greek '' . Richard_Brinsley_Sheridan said , `` I think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two '' . And a witty American <head>journalist</head> remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` Many_a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can n't understand his own meaning '' . There are many types of ambiguity and many_of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology , parisology , and other ologies . In common parlance they would be described as misses - misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds . One species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition .</context>
