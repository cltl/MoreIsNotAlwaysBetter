      <context> This is especially in_evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle_class . Time_and_again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern_world are only_too painfully obvious . The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture Protestantism '' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches . In the <head>absence</head> of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at_hand - and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation . This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman_Vincent_Peale 's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel . But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most_of the pundits seem to have suspected . However , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at_least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace .</context>

      <context> As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life . It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is . This applies to his picture of Adam . It is borne_out also by the <head>absence</head> of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next . It becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality . This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek speaking ones . They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history .</context>

      <context> The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values . The engineering as_such never obtrudes_upon your consciousness . The effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance . This <head>absence</head> of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not_only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue . A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained . The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental_to playing . Yet you feel the orchestra is near at_hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall .</context>

      <context> Freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ; but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit , then Algerian freedom must be postponed . Justice is a worthy objective ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union_of_South_Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer . Prosperity is a worthy objective ; but if providing higher standards_of_living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made . It may be , of_course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in_favor_of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the <head>absence</head> of Soviet Communist power . This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used . This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power .

      <context> The neighborhood high_schools are not , strictly_speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high_school instead of the local school . Indeed , one school_superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high_school for the senior_high_schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational_programs . He prefers to designate such schools as `` general '' high_schools . The suburban high_school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high_school because of the <head>absence</head> of vocational_programs . The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community .

      <context> I have chosen to use the word `` mimesis '' in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the Christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the Greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection . In the first instance , `` mimesis '' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in_terms_of vivid images rather than in_terms_of abstract ideas or conventional designations . By `` image '' is meant not_only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith . This is the primary function of the imagination operating in the <head>absence</head> of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated . Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself . The images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately ; they are fields_of_force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one_another . They bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality .</context>

      <context> His father was a good friend of Rabbi_Szold , and Joe lived with the Szolds for_a_while . Both these youths , who greatly admired Henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring Friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine ; and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with Papa , whose mind - although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it - naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were . Besides , Miss_Henrietta - as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back - had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; so Cyrus_Adler became interested in her friend Racie_Friedenwald , and Joe_Jastrow - the only young_man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta , and signed himself Joe - fell_in_love with pretty sister Rachel . Henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe 's older and more serious brother , Morris , who was just_about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa , when he substituted for Rabbi_Jastrow at Rodeph_Shalom_Temple there during its Rabbi 's <head>absence</head> in Europe .

Unlike his younger brother , Joe , he never presumed_to address her more familiarly than as `` My dear friend '' , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style .

      <context> Hence it is difficult to conceive_of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence . The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen_atoms to occupy general , rather_than special , positions along the [ 111 ] axis . If the **f bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen_atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen_atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheets ; ( 2 ) all hydrogen_atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ( 3 ) hydrogen_atoms are asymmetrically placed , either randomly or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen_atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms . Position ( 2 ) appears to us to be unlikely in_view_of the <head>absence</head> of a piezoelectric_effect and on general chemical structural grounds . A randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen_atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit_cell , for which no evidence exists . Therefore , the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen_atoms are located symmetrically ( 1 ) or asymmetrically ( 3 ) .

      <context> We then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment . Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects . The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in_terms_of various motional modified models of the **f bond in **f . Theoretical studies of the hydrogen_bond generally agree that the **f bond will be linear in the <head>absence</head> of peculiarities of packing in the solid . Moreover , it will be asymmetric until a certain critical **f distance is reached , below which it will become symmetric . There is ample evidence from many sources that the **f bond in **f is symmetric . The **f distance in **f is 2.26 A .</context>

      <context> The gross details of the structure appear reasonable . The structure appears to be unique among ROOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by **f . The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal . However , the possible <head>absence</head> of a center of symmetry not_only moves the hydrogen_atom off **f , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent , with **f at **f and **f at **f ( space group **f ) , where **f represents the oxygens on one side of the **f layers and **f those on the other side . However , any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short **f interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non hydrogen_bonded **f interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 A . Hence it is difficult to conceive_of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence . The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen_atoms to occupy general , rather_than special , positions along the [ 111 ] axis .</context>

      <context> Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin . Its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems , nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in_vitro been unequivocally proven . There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination , for in certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments ( Wolff , Robbins and Rall , 1959 ) . Similar findings have been noted in a patient with congenital <head>absence</head> of the organification enzymes , whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide . In_addition , depending_on availability of dietary iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine . Since the circulating thyroid_hormones are the amino_acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine ( cf. Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid_gland for their release from proteins before secretion . The presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid .</context>

Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process . The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco .</context>

      <context> Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . In_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells_out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the <head>absence</head> of union pressures for higher wages .
