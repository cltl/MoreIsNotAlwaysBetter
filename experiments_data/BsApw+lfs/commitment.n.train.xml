      <context> We marvel at their blindness for not seeing this . Yet are not we of the mid twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there is any such `` thing '' as the devil , just as bad off as they - only in a different way ? In our disbelief we think that we can no_longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in_this play . We are left helpless to cope_with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a <head>commitment</head> to that which has already been discredited and proved false . Even Mr._Miller himself seems uncertain on this score . In a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point : `` However , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer 's many faced lieutenants . And his belief is not to his discredit .</context>

      <context> Lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us . The personal quality of Samuel_Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays . He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern . `` Perhaps '' stands in_place of <head>commitment</head> . At_the_same_time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly . If there were only the mess , all would be clear ; but there is also compassion . As a Christian , I know I do not stand where Beckett stands , but I do see much of what he sees .</context>

      <context> He knows that he must give the expert his place , but he knows that he must also keep him in it . He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing . He knows that he is thinking_about action in_relation_to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog . But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy , well established precedents , the <head>commitments</head> of the United_States under international charters and treaties , basic statutes , and well understood notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such_as country papers and National_Security_Council papers accumulated in the Department . He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted . He must think_about which of these principles must take precedence . He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance .</context>

      <context> On the economic front , the first priority of these countries is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources . Several related tasks must be carried_out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved . These countries must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy . They must in their planning be able to count_on at_least tentative <head>commitments</head> of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years . Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go_forward . Capital flows must be coordinated with national needs and planning . Finally , a balance must be effected among project finance , utilization of agricultural surpluses , and general balance_of_payments support .</context>

      <context> He settled_on the sofa with his coffee , warming his hands on the cup , although the room was heavy with heat . The three had little to say to each other . The previous night 's horror - the absolute failure , overcast with the intrusions of the press , had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness , of play-acting . Sipping their coffee , discussing the weather , the day 's shopping , Fritzie 's <head>commitments</head> at the network ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoided the radio , the morning TV news_show , even the front page of the Santa_Luisa_Register , resting on the kitchen bar . Kidnapper Spurns Ransom ; Amy Still Missing . Once , Andrus walked by it , hastily scanned the bold black headline and the five column lead of the article ( by Duane_Bosch , staff correspondent - age not given ) , and muttered : `` We a buncha national celebrities '' . McFeeley told the parents he would escort them to police_headquarters in a half hour .</context>
