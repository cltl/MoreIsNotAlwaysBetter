      <context> In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at_hand - and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation . This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman_Vincent_Peale 's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel . But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most_of the pundits seem to have suspected . However , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at_least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete <head>indifference</head> to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace . To_be_sure , when this is pointed_out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from Paul 's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of First_Corinthians . But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indignation ? Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking_about the same thing ?</context>

      <context> He had no apparent comprehension of morality ; he divided humanity into `` right guys '' and `` wrong guys '' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under . He had what was described by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality '' . He walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns . Landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly '' but he was , in_fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless <head>indifference</head> to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath . He was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld , the roughneck king . O_'_Banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer , in the North_Side 's Little_Hell , close by the Sicilian quarter and Death_Corner . He had been a choir_boy at the Holy_Name_Cathedral and also served as an acolyte to Father_O_'_Brien .</context>

      <context> These polar concerns ( imitation vs. formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period_of_time . The breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given_rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes . Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi mechanistic powers . The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and <head>indifference</head> of man or_else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery . The image of God has simply disappeared . All such imitations of negative quality have given_rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at_least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak_to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved . The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems .</context>

      <context> Scotty did not go_back to school . His parents talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the University_Hospital - Mr._McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family - and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off , spend a_lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty_much as he chose - provided , of_course , he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating . His teacher and his school_principal were conferred_with and everyone agreed that , if he kept_up with a certain amount of work at home , there was little danger of his losing a term . Scotty accepted the decision with <head>indifference</head> and did not enter the arguments . He was discharged from the hospital after a two day checkup and he and his parents had what Mr._McKinley described as a `` celebration lunch '' at the cafeteria on the campus . Rachel wore a smart hat and , because she had been warned recently about smoking , puffed at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick . Scotty 's father sat sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a cricket , looking about at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression of proprietorship .</context>

      <context> `` Why , I meant what I said '' , Lord declared . `` What else would I mean , anyways '' ? She looked at him , lips compressed . Then , with a shrug of pretended <head>indifference</head> , she took a compact from her purse and went_through_the_motions of fixing her make-up . In his mood , it was the best way to handle him ; that_is , to show no curiosity whatsoever . Otherwise , she would be baited into a tantrum - teased and provoked until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom_Lord Vs. Joyce_Lakewood . The car lurched along at a snail 's crawl , the left front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire , occasionally scraping against the road itself .</context>
