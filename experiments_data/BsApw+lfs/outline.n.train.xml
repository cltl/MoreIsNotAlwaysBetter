      <context> Among the recipients of the Nobel_Prize for Literature more_than half are practically unknown to readers of English . Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner_von_Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago . Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present . In the following sketch we shall present a brief <head>outline</head> of his life and let him as_much_as_possible speak_for himself . Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family . On his father 's side he was of German descent , on his mother 's he came of the old Swedish nobility . The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake_Va ^ ttern in south central Sweden .</context>

An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal_systems , including some of the more unusual types .

Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in Chiba , and divided his life between the land and the sea , supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing_boat .
