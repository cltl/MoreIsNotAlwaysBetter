      <context> In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university 's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist . However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals . In 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen_University , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 . During Oersted 's attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the <head>sciences</head> . He was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof._J._G._L._Manthey ( 1769 - 1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in_addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` Lion_Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him . Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted 's disposal during and after his graduation . In 1800 , Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion_Pharmacy .</context>

      <context> At 12 , Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science . His earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life . In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University_of_Copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session . While Hans devoted himself to the <head>sciences</head> of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law . The brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt . They supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could . So impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society .</context>

      <context> Wiry and burr_headed , with steel_blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals , Chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper . The truth is , however , that when Mel_Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel_chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil . Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical_Service_Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas_City_Medical_Depot when he decided that if he was going_to make the Army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it . Though he knew no more about military <head>science</head> and tactics than any other desk_officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces . The next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding_officer of Troop_H , 7_th_Cavalry , in_the_middle of corps maneuvers in Japan . Outside of combat , he could n't have landed in a tougher spot . First_of_all , no unit likes to have a new CO brought_in from the outside , especially when he 's an armchair trooper .</context>

      <context> We are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very_much at the mercy of man . In_fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day_by_day increasing our fear of each other . I want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear . There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human <head>sciences</head> which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears . Lucretius has remarked : `` The reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of God '' . Perhaps things were even worse then . It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man .</context>

      <context> As cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy increasing properties of the external world . The useful suggestion of Professor_David_Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments . One wonders about its applicability to people . Will advances in human <head>sciences</head> help us build social_structures and governments which will enable us to cope_with people as_effectively_as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic_acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? The answer is of_course yes . For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people . Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes .</context>

      <context> The historian 's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them . It is a characteristic of thoughts that , in re-thinking them we come , ipso_facto , to understand why they were thought '' . Such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition . `` History has this in_common with every other <head>science</head> : that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in_the_first_place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based . This is what was meant , above , by describing history as inferential . The knowledge in_virtue_of_which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events '' . It is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by_no_means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research .</context>
