Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted_out in one shameful moment of covetousness . He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape_Ann property which had seemed to have no_end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer .
