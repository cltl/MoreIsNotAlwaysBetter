      <context> This dissatisfaction led to Howsam 's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game . The powerful New_York Yankees won their 19th world_series in a 5 - game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13 - 5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale . With Mickey_Mantle and Yogi_Berra both out_of_action due_to injuries , the American_League champs still mounted a 15 - hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game . Johnny_Blanchard , Mantle 's <head>replacement</head> , slammed a 2 - run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey_Jay in a 5 - run first inning . Hector_Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3 - run homer off Bill_Henry during another 5 - run explosion in the fourth . The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors . The crowd of 32589 had only two chances to applaud .</context>

      <context> Demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual_beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars . In such a world the words `` matter '' and `` spirit '' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all . In it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in_general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously . The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual <head>replacement</head> of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit_world of the entities which previously populated it . In carrying_out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit . The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support . Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time .</context>

      <context> Check your cafeteria location to make sure it 's convenient for most employees . You may save valuable production minutes with a change . Spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two_weeks . This will cut the expense of vacation <head>replacements</head> . And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates . Also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation . You might try providing standard vacation time_off but make the vacation pay depend_on the number of hours worked in the previous year .</context>

      <context> The commands are specified by the military regulations ; are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound ; and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade_ground . This monitoring is necessary because , on a parade_ground , everyone can hear too_much , and without monitoring a confused social_event would develop . With troops dispersed on fields_of_battle rather than on the parade_ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication . Years ago this was true , but with the <head>replacement</head> of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too_much is heard . In contrast to cocktail_parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal . In the extreme and oversimplified example suggested in Figure 3 , the organization is more easily understood and more predictable in behavior . A military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command .</context>

      <context> The coronary_arteries were sclerotic and diffusely narrowed throughout their courses , and the right_coronary_artery was virtually occluded by a yellow atheromatous plaque 1.5 cm. distal to its origin . The myocardium of the posterior base of the left_ventricle was replaced by gray scar tissue over a 7.5 cm. area . The valves were normal except for thin yellow plaques on the inferior surface of the mitral leaflets . Microscopically , sections from the posterior base of the left_ventricle of the heart showed several large areas of <head>replacement</head> of muscle by fibrous_tissue . In_addition , other sections contained focal areas of recent myocardial necrosis that were infiltrated with neutrophils . Many of the myocardial fibers were hypertrophied and had large , irregular , basophilic nuclei . The intima of the larger coronary_arteries was thickened by fibrous_tissue containing fusiform clefts and mononuclear cells .</context>

      <context> These changes were more marked in the atrophic right kidney than in the left . In_addition , there were 2 small papillary adenomas in the right kidney . The bone of the vertebral bodies , ribs , and sternum was soft and was easily compressed . The marrow of the vertebral bodies was pale and showed areas of fatty <head>replacement</head> . Microscopically , there were many areas of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity . The cells of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic series were normal except for their numbers . There was no evidence of fibrosis .</context>

      <context> I was at_least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication , in which , in listing ' Two_Stem_Meanings ' , I set_off by asterisks those forms in which n of stem B was * * f of stem A_3 , the unasterisked ones standing_for * * f ; or under ' Four_Stems ' , I set_off by asterisks cases where the combined n of stems * * f was * * f . These findings , and_others which will in_time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry . If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per_cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per_cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem <head>replacement</head> would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller . And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones . It is evident that Swadesh has not_only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items . Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list ?</context>

      <context> 22 % of his total list as against 3.5 % in mine . Or the exception may be_due to a particular durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb . More word_class ratios determined in more languages will no_doubt ultimately answer the question . If word_classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem <head>replacement</head> within meaning slot , it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans lingually . Hoijer 's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings ( with allowance for several near synonyms like stomach belly , big large , long far , many much , die dead , say speak ) . For Yokuts , I tabulated these 71 items in five columns , according_as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more_than 4 stems . The totals for these five categories are not too uneven , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively .</context>

      <context> While the U._S. Department_of_Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning . The U._S. Office_of_Education continues to stress local surveys rather_than national surveys . This procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment . Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in_order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future <head>replacement</head> needs for certain skills to justify training_programs for those skills . No effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained . Moreover , the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary . There simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in_demand and the types of training_programs that are required or most suitable .</context>
