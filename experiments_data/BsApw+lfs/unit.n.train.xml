      <context> Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according_to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county <head>unit</head> system - a system which the party opposes in its platform .

The identification of the basic <head>unit</head> of religious organization - the parish or congregation - with a residential area is self_defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron_trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation .

This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches .

( b ) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times . ( c ) Decisions of a general kind are made by the central command .</context>

In the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking_water is equivalent_to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water .

      <context> Still , even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect . A third explanation is suggested by Richardson 's analysis of Sukuma tone . There we see a basically simple phonemic_system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic_system . While the phonemes can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in_some_way to morphemic <head>units</head> , i._e. until the morphophonemics is worked_out , or at_least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success . In the `` typical tone_language '' , tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics . The phonemic_systems which must support these morphophonemic_systems , however , are very different . The inventory of tones is much smaller , and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension , pitch level .</context>

      <context> This can only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are insufficiently general . If , as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems . One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems . Since tone_systems typically comprise fewer <head>units</head> than either consonant or vowel_systems , we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis . Actual practice does not often work_out this way . Tone_systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal_systems . Welmers has suggested one explanation .</context>

      <context> These findings , and_others which will in_time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry . If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per_cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per_cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller . And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable <head>units</head> than with variously unstable ones . It is evident that Swadesh has not_only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items . Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list ? It is the urge to obtain a list as free_of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible .</context>

      <context> When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesized '' - into larger planar shapes themselves simply in_order to maintain the integrity of the picture_plane . Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut_away too abruptly into depth ; and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump_out of plane . Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to_the_extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) . It was because of this chain-reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar <head>unit</head> in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_objects , or at_least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there . Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities . Synthetic_Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this was the_point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it .</context>

      <context> In the midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . The high cost of land and a_few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per <head>unit</head> volume . Research at Fayette_, Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg / l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb BOD / day / acre . Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer .</context>
