      <context> Catholics , Protestants and Jews are in_agreement over the objectives of family_planning , but disagree over the methods to be used . The Roman_Catholic_Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm_method , also_known_as the use of the infertile or safe period . The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature 's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them .

Here is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement . The grounds for the Church 's position are Scriptural ( Old_Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural_law . The latter plays a prominent role in Roman_Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods .</context>

      <context> Men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth floor of the Hotel_Dumont and blew it off again , and did the same in a tiny , almost airless room in a tenement in the West_Forties . And men also used vacuum_cleaners in both rooms , sucking dust up once_more . Men from the Third_Detective_District , Eighteenth_Precinct , had the longest , the most tedious , job . At the Hotel_Dumont there had , at the time in_issue , been twenty-three overnighters , counting <head>couples</head> as singular . These included , as one , Mr. and Mrs._Anthony_Payne , who had checked_in a little after noon the day before , and had not checked_out together . But Gardner_Willings was not included ; he had been at the Dumont for almost a week . There was , of_course , no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel .</context>

A taxi took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car , and a_few minutes later he found a parking_place across the street from his apartment . Because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past <head>couple</head> of hours , he did not think to look and see if Jerry_Burton 's car was still there . In_fact , he did not think_about Jerry_Burton at_all until he entered his living_room and closed the door behind him . Only then , when his glance focused_on the divan and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem . Even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread_over Burton , the pillow , the sheet_of_paper on top of it .</context>

      <context> Even in the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still disappearing . For less_than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on - a blatant and defiant rustler named Fred_Powell . `` Fred was mighty crude about the way he took_in cattle '' his own hired_man , Andy_Ross , mentioned later . `` Everyone knew it , but he sort_of acted like he did n't care who knew it - even after them notes came , even after he 'd heard about Lewis , even after he 'd been shot at a <head>couple</head> o ' times hisself '' !
