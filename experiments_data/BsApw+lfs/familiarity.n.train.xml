      <context> Certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of Western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the Bible . This reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence . A contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , St._Augustine , John_Bunyan , and Thomas_Jefferson , all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great_deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression . In much the same way , we recognize the importance of Shakespeare 's <head>familarity</head> with Plutarch and Montaigne , of Shelley 's study of Plato 's dialogues , and of Coleridge 's enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from Plato to Schelling and William_Godwin , through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of English men_of_letters . We may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists . English philosopher Samuel_Alexander 's debt to Wordsworth and Meredith is a recent interesting example , as also A._N._Whitehead 's understanding of the English romantics , chiefly Shelley and Wordsworth . Hegel 's profound admiration for the insights of the Greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth century philosophy .</context>

      <context> Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant_systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal_systems , including some of the more unusual types . By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no_more of the range of possibilities in tone_systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour_languages . This limited <head>familiarity</head> with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone . Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist . Papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work . The second need is better field techniques .</context>

      <context> He looked lazy , spoiled , a_little querulous . Rachel had little to say . She greeted her husband 's colleagues with smiling politeness , offering nothing . Mr._McKinley , for all his sprawling and his easy <head>familiarity</head> , was completely alert to his son , eyes always on the still face , jumping to anticipate Scotty_'s desires . It was a strained , silent lunch . Rachel said , `` I 'd_better get him to bed '' . The doctors had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger .</context>

      <context> It had been five days too late before he learned that she 'd gone_through the wedding_ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum , administered by her mother .

He had left her inviolate , thinking <head>familiarity</head> would gentle her in_time . But each mile westward , she had hated him the deeper . He stared at the dipper , turning it over_and_over in his wide , calloused hands . `` I suppose '' , he muttered , `` I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks , once we find a settlement '' .</context>
