      <context> If an offense occurs in a meeting , the assembly , <head>having</head> witnessed it themselves , can vote on a punishment without the need for a trial . The chair has no authority to impose a penalty or to order the offending member to be removed from the hall , but the assembly has that power . Mason 's Manual of Legislative Procedure states that the power of discipline is within the assembly as a whole and not the presiding officer acting alone .</context>

      <context> The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission . After this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men ; a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation - hunger and exposure . In this changed world , Prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose . Here , this happy , roving son of good_fortune proved that he could accept the <head>disciplines</head> of a new social economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world . Here , Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism - producing music for the masses . It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges . One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous .</context>

      <context> He accepted the environment of his destiny - took_root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise . By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people : `` I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at_the_same_time I have by_no_means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody . This is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose - the clarity must be new , not old '' . How right he was ; how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the <head>discipline</head> of modern traditionalism . And with what resource did Prokofieff back_up his Credo of words - with torrents of powerful music . Compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little Classical_Symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent Fifth_Symphony ; or the Love_for_Three_Oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , The Stone_Flower . This masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people : earthy , salty and humorous .</context>

      <context> The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms , but about 1930 it was in_favor_of games . The parallel_bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal_bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football . But the Russians use gymnastics as the first_step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance . The gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , <head>discipline</head> , persistence and the desire for perfection . In short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great_deal of character as_well . The addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen . Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life .</context>

      <context> Finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing_up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with Cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann 's stories . We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates . For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody . Professionally a lawyer , that_is_to_say associated with dignity , reserve , <head>discipline</head> , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed_up , disguised - that_is , paradoxically , revealed - as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child . That this abandonment takes_place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring_down upon him the punishment for art ; that_is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann 's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even_though the constant elements of the artist nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and La^utner . It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann 's early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic . In a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one_and_the_same .</context>

      <context> Their meditations were approaching a violent cusp that would shape Martian art for many millennia . On Earth elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited_edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation_marks and spaces ; Time_magazine reviewed it and suggested that the Federation_Assembly_Daily_Record should be translated into the medium . A colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs of plants and Mrs._Joseph_Shadow_of_Greatness_Douglas was quoted as saying : `` I would no_more sit_down without flowers on my table than without serviettes '' . A Tibetan swami from Palermo , Sicily , announced in Beverly_Hills a newly discovered , ancient yoga <head>discipline</head> for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and cosmic attraction between sexes . His chelas were required to assume the matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while he read aloud from Rig-Veda and an assistant guru examined their purses in another room - nothing was stolen ; the purpose was less immediate . The President_of_the_United_States proclaimed the first Sunday in November as `` National_Grandmothers_'_Day '' and urged America to say it with flowers . A funeral_parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting .</context>
