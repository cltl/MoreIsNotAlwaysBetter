      <context> In_the_end , Picasso and Braque plumped_for the representational , and it would seem they did so deliberately .

      <context> Now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers , merge without let . Self 's <head>integrity</head> was and is and ever had been . Mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves , the many threes-fulfilled on Mars , corporate and discorporate , the precious few on Earth - the unknown powers of three on Earth that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at_last long waiting he grokked and cherished himself . Mike remained in trance ; there was much to grok , loose_ends to puzzle_over and fit into his growing - all that he had seen and heard and been at the Archangel_Foster_Tabernacle ( not just cusp when he and Digby had come face_to_face alone ) - why Bishop_Senator_Boone made him warily uneasy , how Miss_Dawn_Ardent tasted like a water_brother when she was not , the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping_up_and_down and wailing - Jubal 's conversations coming and going - Jubal 's words troubled him most ; he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling , struggling to bridge between languages , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in .</context>
