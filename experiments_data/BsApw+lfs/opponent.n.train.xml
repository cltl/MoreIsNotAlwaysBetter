      <context> Rep._Wesley_Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West_Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman_Bill_Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . <head>Opponents</head> generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice . All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep._Bill_Jones , who was absent . Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas ' big cities Thursday . Rep._James_Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water_development bill passed by the Texas House_of_Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort_Worth to cover_up places like Paradise , a Wise_County hamlet of 250 people .</context>

      <context> Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent_on following compulsively in his footsteps . When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural . Thus , when the Russians sent up their first sputnik , American chagrin was human enough , and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable . But to imitate an <head>opponent</head> when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly . When East_Germans fled to the West by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists . They are less vocal now , when it is the West_Berliners who are migrating . The flood is not as great - only 700 a week according_to one apparently conservative account - but it is symptomatic .</context>

      <context> He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college . He loved them . It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known . Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his handicap , his irons , his stance , his <head>opponents</head> , and his weather in_detail , but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries . His money was tied_up in a Nassau hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been running against him . His worries harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window . In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves .</context>
