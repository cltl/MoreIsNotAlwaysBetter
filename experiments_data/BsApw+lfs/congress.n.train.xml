      <context> It is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at_least the practical consequences thereof , upon others . It is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched_fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others . Both Roman_Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past . Consider what happened during World_War_1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through <head>Congress</head> . Many_of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful . With over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . With the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens .</context>

The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders .

When in 1816 an act of <head>Congress</head> forced the foreign firm out of the United_States , its British born employees , now become American citizens - Joseph_Rolette , Joseph_Renville and Alexis_Bailly - continued in the fur business . On Big_Stone_Lake near the headwaters of the Red_River , Robert_Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian_Department of Canada , had a trading_post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces . His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red_River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts . These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander_Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk colony was begun .</context>

      <context> I am naive , they say , to make use of such words . I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? - liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as_well_as democratic processes may have to yield before it . This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a President of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative <head>Congress</head> or Supreme_Court . As for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms . The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one . Why , in_the_first_place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ?</context>

One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage .

      <context> The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of GNP . The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest . Because of its importance , and because the lack of price_competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases . The threat of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of endangering relations with customers , <head>Congress</head> , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases . For the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry limited price ( but not below average_cost ) . For such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs ( due_to rising wages , etc . ) . Thus , if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate .</context>
