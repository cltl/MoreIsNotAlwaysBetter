      <context> A prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested . The transducer is a null type instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm , 0.001 in. thick and 1 in. in diameter . A small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced 0.001 in. apart ( for * * f ) . Spherical concave <head>backing</head> surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit . Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 * * f and at pressures up_to 250 atm , an overload of 300 psi , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at_most , one millimeter_of_mercury . A 6 - year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed . This project was carried_out under sponsorship of the Ballistic_Missile_Division_of_the_Air_Research_and_Development_Command , U._S._Air_Force , and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat_energy of chemical binding .</context>

      <context> The concentration of effective power in Rabat leads not_only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in_addition to contributing to more meaningful elections . Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber_of_Commerce elections , which took_place three weeks before national elections . The Istiqlal sponsored U.M.C.I.A. ( L'Union_Marocaine_des_Commercants , Industrialistes_et_Artisans ) was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P. ( L'Union_National_des_Forces_Populaires ) in nearly all urban_centers . As the more conservative group with strong <head>backing</head> from wealthy businessmen , the U.M.C.I.A. was generally favored against the more progressive , labor based U.N.F.P. The newer party campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small_businessmen to support them as they had done for many years . The local Istiqlal and U.M.C.I.A. offices did not campaign and lost heavily . The value of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as shown in Table /1 , . The chamber_of_Commerce elections were , of_course , an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections .</context>

      <context> But this situation of Kent_House was more subtle . The wages involved were larger and more regular . The inmates were white and from out of town , avoiding local friction . The <head>backing</head> from the white town was greater and there was little publicity . Good wages , patronage and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes . And yet Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go . And for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean practically the end of his career in the Methodist_church , if not in all churches .</context>
