      <context> But how can one figure symbolize both ? Christianity declares that in the life and death of Jesus_Christ the unique and the universal concur . Perhaps no church_father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as Irenaeus . To be the Savior and the Lord , Jesus_Christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own ; he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to <head>earth</head> for_a_while but never identifies itself with man 's history . Yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind . His history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it . His death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of Jesus .</context>

      <context> Nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God , and he still rules . Even death , therefore , has a providential as_well_as a punitive function . `` Wherefore also He [ God ] drove him [ man ] out of Paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because He envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because He pitied him , [ and did not desire ] that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable . But He set a bound to his [ state of ] sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take_place in the <head>earth</head> , so_that man , ceasing at_length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to God '' . This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus ' theology ; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ . As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life . It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is .</context>

      <context> The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam . As Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of Christ . `` Whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ? From God 's Will and Wisdom , and from virgin <head>earth</head> . For ' God had not rained ' , says the Scripture , before man was made , ' and there was no man to till the earth ' .

      <context> He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as_well_as of mortality . Therefore Irenaeus describes man 's creation as_follows : `` So_that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted_up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take_up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all . And He laid_down for him certain conditions : so_that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into <head>earth</head> , whence his frame had been taken '' . These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result . There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) . Man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil 's promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality .</context>

      <context> When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia . It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment . His pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale ; they universalize in_terms_of weather , skies , <head>earth</head> , and people . By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , Roy_Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art .

      <context> Radio_observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets .

This result suggests a very high_temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black_body merely by coincidence . For the case of Jupiter , the radio_emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the <head>earth</head> is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non thermal components .

It should be possible , however , to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio_sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers . Measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth .</context>

But even before he started across the oiled road to his Plymouth , parked in the lot under the cypress_trees across from the station , he knew that he was n't going_home . Not_yet . It was nine o_'_clock in the morning : the hour which , like a spade turning clods of <head>earth</head> , exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain_dormant in the quiet night . Mission_Street at this hour was populated by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his tour of duty - the neighborhood that had known Urbano_Quintana by day . Sol_Phillips had purchased the Alliance_Furniture_Mart seventeen years ago . It was professedly worth three thousand dollars in stock and good_will , and the name was written in gold in foot high letters across each of the two display_windows .</context>

On <head>Earth</head> elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited_edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation_marks and spaces ; Time_magazine reviewed it and suggested that the Federation_Assembly_Daily_Record should be translated into the medium . A colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs of plants and Mrs._Joseph_Shadow_of_Greatness_Douglas was quoted as saying : `` I would no_more sit_down without flowers on my table than without serviettes '' . A Tibetan swami from Palermo , Sicily , announced in Beverly_Hills a newly discovered , ancient yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and cosmic attraction between sexes . His chelas were required to assume the matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while he read aloud from Rig-Veda and an assistant guru examined their purses in another room - nothing was stolen ; the purpose was less immediate .</context>

      <context> I called the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves_Moreland , the Anglo-American literary critic - his mother was_born in Ohio - who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson_Downs , raising_hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old_man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such_as human stature , hope , and humor . My unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in_terms_of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from <head>earth</head> , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe_in the cult_of_personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . A bee 's place is in the hive '' . `` I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and_then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand .</context>
