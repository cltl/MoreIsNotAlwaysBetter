      <context> The Postmaster_General recently reported that mail_order frauds - among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently - are at the highest level in history . Similarly , the American_Cancer_Society ( ACS ) , the Arthritis_and_Rheumatism_Foundation , and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high . For_example , the BBB has reported it was receiving four_times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as_many complaints compared with two years ago . Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any <head>sum</head> they come_up with is only a surface manifestation - turned_up by their inevitably limited policing - of the real loot of the medical racketeer . In this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative . The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of_course . But it is our health - more precious than all the money in the world - that these modern witch_doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away .</context>

      <context> His plunder is therefore far higher - running into hundreds of millions . According_to the Food_and_Drug_Administration ( FDA ) , `` Doctor '' Ghadiali , Dr._Albert_Abrams and his clique , and Dr._Wilhelm_Reich - to name three notorious device quacks - succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines . Authorities believe that many_of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business . Look_at the <head>sums</head> paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland . Sarah_Gross , a dress_shop proprietor , paid $ 1020 to a masseur , and Mr._A. , a laborer , paid $ 4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines - the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' . Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually . You will come_up with a frightening total .</context>

      <context> Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ; the tricks that time plays_with memory and memory with time are queerest of all . From maturity one looks_back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large . In a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a_lot of water ; the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it . Time in the <head>sum</head> is nothing . And yet - a year to a child is an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one 's being - a certain mental landscape - will seem to have endured without beginning and without end . The part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate , `` It could have been like that for only a_little while '' ; but true memory does not count nor add : it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time . Once , then - for how many years or how few does not matter - my world was bound round by fences , when I was too small to reach the apple_tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull myself up .</context>

      <context> These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services .

The first part of the new structure - that for supporting the basic program of vocational_rehabilitation services - is described in this Section .

      <context> Such an operator is obviously the zero operator ; for since it is nilpotent , the minimal polynomial for this operator is of the form * * f for some * * f ; but then since the operator is diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root ; hence * * f and the minimal polynomial is simply x , which says the operator is 0 . Thus we see that * * f and * * f . Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field F , e.g. , the field of complex_numbers . Then every linear_operator T on V can be written as the <head>sum</head> of a diagonalizable operator D and a nilpotent operator N which commute . These operators D and N are unique and each is a polynomial in T . From these results , one sees that the study of linear_operators on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators . For vector spaces over non algebraically closed fields , we still need to find some substitute for characteristic values and vectors .</context>

      <context> Binomial_distributions were treated by James_Bernoulli about 1700 , and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called Bernoulli trials . Each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success . Therefore each binomial trial can be thought_of as producing a value of a random_variable associated with that trial and taking the values 0 and 1 , with probabilities q and p respectively . The several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random_variable X , the total number of successes , which is just the <head>sum</head> of the random_variables associated with the single trials . The marksman gets two bull's-eyes , one on his third shot and one on his fifth . The numbers of successes on the five individual shots are , then , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 . The number of successes on each shot is a value of a random_variable that has values 0 or 1 , and there are 5 such random_variables here .</context>
