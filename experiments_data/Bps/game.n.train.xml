      <context> Baltimore 's bulky spring_training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul_Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit . `` Take a ride on this one '' , Brooks_Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third_sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third inning two run double off the left centerfield wall tonight . It was the first of two doubles by Robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate . Just before <head>game</head> time , Robinson 's pretty wife , Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer . Unfortunately , Brooks ' teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven hit pitching of three Kansas_City rookie hurlers . Hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with Lee_MacPhail ; J._A._W._Iglehart , chairman of the Oriole board_of_directors , and Public_Relations_Director Jack_Dunn . Their flight was delayed , Dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane .</context>

      <context> Indications as_late_as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory drought as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage . Over the first five frames , Jack_Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in_the_middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American_League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick_Hyde , submarine_ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock . A two run homer by Norm_Siebern and a solo_blast by Bill_Tuttle tied the <head>game</head> , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . With one down in the eighth , Marv_Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . Catcher Frank_House 's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . Then Heywood_Sullivan , Kansas_City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run .</context>

The Orioles once_again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas_City pitchers .

Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally .</context>

      <context> It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics . Taking first things first , let 's understand the sport called gymnastics . It is made_up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run_through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work . The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms , but about 1930 it was in_favor_of <head>games</head> . The parallel_bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal_bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football . But the Russians use gymnastics as the first_step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance . The gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection .</context>

With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now . There were umbrella_tents , wall_tents , cottage_tents , station_wagon tents , pup_tents , Pop_tents , Baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper_trailers , travel_trailers , and even a_few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps .

We saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70 mile long National_Seashore_Recreation_Area . Dealers would do_well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers . Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry .</context>

      <context> Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account_for group_actions , to provide a focal_point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification . One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United_States in more recent years . The popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American_War , the steady currency of the Lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass_media are cases_in_point . Nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national <head>game</head> in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of American life , that learned societies such_as the American_Folklore_Society and the American_Historical_Association were founded in the 1880's , or that courses in American literature , American civilization , American anything have swept our school and college curricula . Of_course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth century United_States . Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man_in_the_street . It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine .</context>
