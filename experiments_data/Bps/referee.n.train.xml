      <context> This further demonstration of O_'_Banion 's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone . In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self_aggrandisement for their liking . He behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness . They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado - as , when his bodyguard , Yankee_Schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by Dave_Miller , a prize-fight <head>referee</head> , chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were Hirschey , a gambler politician in loose beer running league with Torrio and O_'_Banion , Frank , a policeman , and Max , the youngest . To settle this slight , O_'_Banion went down to the La_Salle_Theatre in the Loop , where , he had learned , Dave_Miller was attending the opening of a musical_comedy . At the end of the performance , Dave and Max came_out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first_nighters . O_'_Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave , severely wounding him in the stomach .</context>
