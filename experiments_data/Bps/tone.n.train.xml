      <context> Now , not_only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious_orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non_Catholic members of the University . Some Catholic priests lecture there ; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students . Further evidence that Roman_Catholicism enjoys a more favorable_position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to_it in the mass_media of England . The general <head>tone</head> of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester_Guardian and the Sunday_Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic_Church is now at_least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches . On successive Sundays during October , 1960 , Paul_Ferris ( a non-Catholic ) wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen of the Church_of_England , the Church_of_Rome and the Nonconformist_Church . The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came_out the best . There were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very_much to do as clergyman .</context>

      <context> About the Pro_Arte 's contribution I am less happy . I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group . From a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro_Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here . The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his <head>tone</head> is pinched and edgy . The twenty-five year old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet . There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is_due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs . Turning_to the more modern versions , Curzon 's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work .</context>

      <context> We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers . Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms . So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting_grounds of `` Uncle_Sam '' ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedoms in <head>tone</head> , color , dance , design , and thought . Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing . In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native_land . The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission .</context>

      <context> Inspiring - yes ; instructive - maybe ; duplicable - no ! But for the technical fact , we have the artist 's own testimony : `` Of_late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors . First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately * * f inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values - the lightest light , the middle <head>tone</head> , and the darkest dark - by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns . If a human figure or wild_life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch . For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose . `` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .</context>

However , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents .

      <context> Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field . A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy . The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials . When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when <head>tones</head> of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance . These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice . The presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even_though it is but vaguely understood . Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed .</context>

Sadie studied piano ; played Chopin in the `` Soiree_Musicale of Mr._Guthrie 's Pupils '' ; and she recited `` Hector 's_Farewell_to_Andromache '' most movingly , to the special delight of Rabbi_Jastrow at his home in Germantown near Philadelphia , where the Szold girls took_turns visiting between the visits of the Jastrow boys at the Szolds ' in Baltimore .

      <context> It is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient 's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding_sway . One learns to become alert to changes in his vocal <head>tone</head> - to his voice 's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrotlike . The content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph_needle were stuck in one groove ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over_and_over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . Eventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior - which , as_usual , went_on without any accompanying words from her - she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny '' ?</context>

At another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother introject began to emerge more_and_more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' ! I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; but a_few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory <head>tone</head> , `` Your father despises you '' !

      <context> While the phonemes can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in_some_way to morphemic units , i._e. until the morphophonemics is worked_out , or at_least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success . In the `` typical tone_language '' , tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics . The phonemic_systems which must support these morphophonemic_systems , however , are very different . The inventory of <head>tones</head> is much smaller , and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension , pitch level .

The possibilities in the consonantal_system are very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually used .

Tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the <head>tone</head> . The possibilities are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater .
