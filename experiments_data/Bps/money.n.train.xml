Nor have we remembered that in the melting_pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material .

      <context> For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs . Productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time_period is not even well_known to the industry , much_less to the union or to the public . Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit_margins related to a productivity increase should be shared . The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in <head>money</head> wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity share increases as distinct from a cost raising increase in the basic wage rate . We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price level increases may offset wage rate increases , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate . For internal political reasons , the union asks for ( and accepts ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up_to the discretion of the companies of the industry . Changes in the basic wage rate are cost raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices .</context>

      <context> Indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific . In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliament - the elected representatives - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary . When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit - when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands - two purposes were served : Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law became a rational system for implementing that will , for serving conscious goals , for embodying the `` public policy '' . It is true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , inhibited the free flow of <head>money</head> , goods , and labor ; but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy . Law was seen as an emanation of the `` sovereign will '' . However , the sovereign was not Hobbes ' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin . It was , too , an optimistic philosophy , and , though it separated law from morality , it was by_no_means an immoral or amoral one .</context>

      <context> To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative_officials and judges - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with . Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society . Indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society . Government itself was based upon contract ; business_organization - the corporation - was analyzed in contractual terms ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and <head>money</head> was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement . It is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in_terms_of contract . In_fact , some - Anzilotti is the principle example - went so far as to say that all international_law could be traced to the single legal norm , Pacta sunt Servanda . The displacement ( at_least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international_law theory and doctrine .</context>

Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in_theory or in_practice . Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; even houses changed once a decade ; six hours of manual_labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; no private_property , no <head>money</head> ; no sort of pricing at_all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term . Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist .

      <context> the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather_than a central city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminates city sales_tax . The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened .

In many cases that statement `` We break_even on our downtown operation and make <head>money</head> on our branches '' would be turned_around if the cost_analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store . Fear of the competition - always a great motivating force in the American economy - makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival 's shiny new branches . The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches . Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act_as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover .</context>
