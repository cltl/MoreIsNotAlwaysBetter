      <context> First , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per_se cannot take economic leadership . Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind . When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism . The biggest loss , of_course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the <head>growth</head> of his company and our economy .

An aggressor would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity in a target population . A solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized . It must be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent .</context>

      <context> Beebe had a 3 - foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces . A difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size . I have little information on the anaconda 's rate_of_growth . Hans_Schweizer had one that increased from 19 - 1 2 inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years , and J_._J_._Quelch records a <head>growth</head> of from less_than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years . It is very unlikely that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate . In 1948 , Afranio_do_Amaral , the noted Brazilian herpetologist , wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes . He concluded that the anaconda 's maximum length is 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meters , which would approximate from 39 to 42 feet ( 14 meters is slightly less that 46 feet ) .</context>

      <context> Felix_Kopstein states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length '' , but goes_on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three_times that at maturity . It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is_due to captive conditions . Additional records of slow <head>growth</head> have been omitted . It is possible to make a_few generalizations about the six giants themselves . There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa_constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda ) . Data on the former are scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length .</context>

      <context> For four of the six ( the anaconda and the amethystine_python cannot be included for lack of data ) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa_constrictor being the smallest and the Indian_python the next in size at the former stage . Let us speculate a_little on the maximum size of the anaconda . If , in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet .

As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions - particularly the former - provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period . Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress . It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 <head>growth</head> centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2 . As one approach to doing this , Figures 3 and 4 have been constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 . The differences between onset age and completion age with_respect_to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows . The data for boy 34 appear in Figure 3 , and for girl 2 in Figure 4 .</context>

If modernization programs are imposed from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulties . Land_reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries . It should be American policy not_only to encourage effective land_reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic <head>growth</head> and modernization of the society . As an isolated policy , land_reform is likely to be politically disruptive ; as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance . It should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone .

      <context> Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go_forward . Capital flows must be coordinated with national needs and planning . Finally , a balance must be effected among project finance , utilization of agricultural surpluses , and general balance_of_payments support . Thus , although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative , and many_of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant , the basic purpose of American economic_policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining <head>growth</head> is not prevented by lack of foreign_exchange . There remain many political and administrative problems to be solved . For_one_thing , although considerable numbers of men have been trained , bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects ; even the famed Indian_Civil_Service is not fully adequate_to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken . Technical assistance in training middle - and upper-level management_personnel is still needed in many cases .</context>

      <context> The major weakness of vocational training_programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands . This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country . Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained_workers . All the manuals for setting_up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the <head>growth</head> of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content . Furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys . Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded_as more hypothetical . While the U._S. Department_of_Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning .</context>

The `` leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam_turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not_yet blighted . The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in selecting his plant site .</context>
