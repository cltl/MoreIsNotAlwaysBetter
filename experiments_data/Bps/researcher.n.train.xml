      <context> From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail . The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today 's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat . For many_of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood_vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed . A group of <head>researchers</head> at the University_of_Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques . One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched . A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed . Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood_vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy .</context>

      <context> And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive - the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response . Marriage manuals and women 's magazine_articles began to stress the importance of the female climax . They began to describe in_detail the woman 's capacity for response . In_fact , the noted psychologist and sex <head>researcher</head> , Dr._Albert_Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men . According to Dr._Ellis , the average 20 - year old American woman is capable of far greater sexual_arousal than her partner . Not surprisingly , Dr._Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out_to claim these capabilities . Yet , paradoxically , according to Dr._Maurice_Linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing_up to them .</context>

      <context> These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of_all_time . For hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted_of ( 1 ) the captain 's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man 's desk on_board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports . All_told , they offered a highly confused picture . But since 1927 , <head>researchers</head> digging_into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information . Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage . Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations . First , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma .</context>
