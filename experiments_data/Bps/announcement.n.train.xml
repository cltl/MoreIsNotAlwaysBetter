      <context> Skorich began his new job auspiciously today . At a ceremony in the reception_room of Mayor_Richardson_Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football .

      <context> He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices . Han 's student days were at_a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent . The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in_charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university . He was stirred by the <head>announcement</head> of Volta 's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic_pile to experiments with acids and alkalis . The following year he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr '' , traveling in Germany , France , and the_Netherlands , meeting the philosophers Schelling , Fichte , and Tieck . He also met Count_Rumford ( born Benjamin_Thompson in Woburn,_Mass . ) who was then serving the Elector_of_Bavaria , and the physicist Ritter ; these were Oersted 's main contacts in science . From Go ^ ttingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` The first question asked everywhere is about galvanism .</context>

      <context> It is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere - about 30 per_cent of the women and 25 per_cent of the men in the graduating_class - the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed_up the estimate . `` Almost everybody in the senior_class is married '' , students say dogmatically . And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the House_Plan_Association ) that have good news to impart . These <head>announcements</head> are , in_effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage_marts . There are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings , pinnings , ringings , engagements , and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity . `` Witt_House happily announces the engagement of Fran_Horowitz to Erwin_Schwartz of Fife_House '' . The Brooklyn_College student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models .</context>

      <context> Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social_system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective . In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them - and that with independence free_men do not have_to work to realize the benefits of modern life . For_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its <head>announcement</head> . The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies . We should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call_for effort as_well_as enthusiasm .</context>

      <context> They were , in_a_sense , `` tried_out '' in realistic situations . From the point_of_view of the applicants , less time was wasted in being evaluated - and they got a meal out of it as_well_as some insights into their performances . Another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real_life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work . The position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an <head>announcement</head> was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions . All applicants were generally familiar_with the work of the receptionist . At the end of work one day , the personnel man took the applicants one_at_a_time , asked them to sit behind the receptionist 's desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes . Each girl was independently `` tested '' by the personnel man , and he served not_only as the director , but as the antagonist and the observer .</context>

      <context> But one day , she expected , he would somehow discover , without her having_to tell him , that there was such a woman in the world ; a woman who was willing to give him love , faith , and anything else a woman could give a husband . Indeed , there was a woman who , unasked , had already given him love . Unquestionably , Blanche loved Stanley . And_then , unexpectedly , Stanley made his <head>announcement</head> . On that first day , Blanche literally thought she was going_to die , or , at the very least , go out of her mind . It might have been easier for her if Kitti_Walker had n't been everything that Blanche was not . Kitti was thirty years younger than Stanley , taller than Stanley , prettier than Stanley had any right to hope for , much_less expect .</context>
