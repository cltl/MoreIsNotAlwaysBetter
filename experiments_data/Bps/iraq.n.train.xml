      <context> Indonesia , in the early_days of the Republic , leaned toward the West . Today Sukarno 's government is heavily besieged by avowed Communists , and for all_of its `` neutralist '' pretensions , it is a firm ally of Soviet policy . Ceylon has moved from a pro Western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West . In the Middle_East , <head>Iraq</head> , Syria and Egypt were , a short while ago , in the Western camp . Today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West , are dependent for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel ; in almost every particular follow the Kremlin 's foreign_policy line . A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve . Never_mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination : the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land_mass was under the domination and influence of the West .</context>

      <context> We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene . When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold_war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not_only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development . As a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world community . When we look_at countries like Iran , <head>Iraq</head> , Pakistan , and Burma , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern_men and of social overhead capital , and where institutions of centralized government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy . The men in power are committed in_principle to modernization , but economic and social changes are proceeding only erratically . Isolated enterprises have been launched , but they are not_yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern . The society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector , with very poor communications between the two .</context>
