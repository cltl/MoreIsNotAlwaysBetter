      <context> Natural_gas public_utility companies would be given the right of eminent_domain , under a bill by Sen._Frank_Owen /3 , of El_Paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas . Marshall_Formby of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas_Highway_Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections . Under Formby 's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant_governor , speaker of the House , attorney_general and chief_justice of the Texas_Supreme_Court . State representatives decided <head>Thursday</head> against taking_a_poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State_Affairs_Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . Rep._Wesley_Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West_Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman_Bill_Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 .</context>

      <context> The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice . All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep._Bill_Jones , who was absent . Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas ' big cities <head>Thursday</head> . Rep._James_Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water_development bill passed by the Texas House_of_Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort_Worth to cover_up places like Paradise , a Wise_County hamlet of 250 people . When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas . Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen._Parkhouse .</context>

      <context> Committee approval of Gov._Price_Daniel 's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain <head>Thursday</head> despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered_down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House_Committee_on_Revenue_and_Taxation . Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . But questions with which committee_members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of_it .</context>

      <context> `` This is a poor boy 's bill '' , said Chapman . `` Dallas and Fort_Worth can vote bonds . This would help the little peanut districts '' . A Houston teacher , now serving in the Legislature , proposed <head>Thursday</head> a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods '' . Rep._Henry_C._Grover , who teaches history in the Houston public_schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester_hours the so-called `` teaching_methods '' courses required to obtain a junior or senior_high_school teaching_certificate . A normal year 's work in college is 30 semester_hours . Grover also would require junior senior_high teachers to have at_least 24 semester_hours credit in the subject they are teaching .</context>

      <context> His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott_Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor_B._Jones of Houston , J._B._Brady of Harlingen and Howard_Cox of Austin . Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . Senators unanimously approved <head>Thursday</head> the bill of Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day_schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . It would authorize the Texas_Education_Agency to establish county-wide day_schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of_age to attend the day_schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas_School_for_the_Deaf here .</context>

      <context> `` He 's looking a_lot better , and he 's able to run '' , Meek explained . `` We 'll let him do a_lot of running this week , but I do n't know if he 'll be able to play '' . The game players saw the Air_Force film Monday , ran for 30_minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes . `` We 'll work hard Tuesday , Wednesday and <head>Thursday</head> '' , Meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday . We 'll work_out about an hour on Saturday , then we 'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week , then taper_off '' .

Manager_Hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment . After <head>Thursday</head> 's open date , Solly plans to open with Larry_Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night . Harvey_Haddix , set_back by the flu this season , will start against his former Cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain Kenny_Boyer in tonight 's game at Busch_Stadium . Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck . Haddix has a 13 - 8 record against the Redbirds , despite only a 1 - 3 mark in 1960 .</context>

      <context> It is not news that Nathan_Milstein is a wizard of the violin . Certainly not in Orchestra_hall where he has played countless recitals , and where <head>Thursday</head> night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago_Symphony_orchestra , playing the Brahms_Concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed . There was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white_heat . Not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent . Those would be reserved for the orchestra 's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself .</context>

      <context> This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations . To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores . Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing - and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them . One wife , described by a New_York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual_relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the <head>Thursday</head> night neighborhood card parties . Another put sex on a dollars and cents basis . After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband 's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor . Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .</context>

      <context> It was nearly sundown before they finished the business with Beall and began riding down the stream . They had traveled only a short distance when they spotted five Mexicans riding along a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them . Suspecting an ambush , the two deputies decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short_cut into Catskill . After spending two nights ( Wednesday and <head>Thursday</head> ) in Catskill , the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business . They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old Garnett_Lee ranch . Half a mile below at the mouth of Salyer_'s_Canyon was an old ranch that the company had purchased from A._J._Armstrong , occupied by a Mexican , his wife , and an old trapper . There were three houses in Salyer_'s_Canyon just at the foot of a low bluff , the road winding along the top , entering above , and_then passing down in_front_of the houses , thence to the Vermejo .</context>

      <context> His lordship was concerned in the management of Drury_Lane but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and criticize her novel ? At_last he consented to meet her , and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal : Have you any objection to the following plan ? On <head>Thursday</head> evening we may go_out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles . There we shall be free and unknown ; we can return the following morning . She concluded by asking for a brief interview - `` to settle with you where '' - and she threw_in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild originality of your countenance '' . She opened his reply with trembling fingers .</context>

      <context> She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road . Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window . She had begun to turn_back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood_still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word_of_farewell . He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at_a_time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a_little and his breath came hard through his nicotine choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate_Gallery on a <head>Thursday</head> once . Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure_enough he pointed at her with his index_finger and said `` Toot '' ! once_more and roared_off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked . She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building . There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind .</context>

      <context> A bunch of amateur dervishes ! What we need is to get_back to the group , to learning and apprenticeship , to the cafe and the school '' . He could certainly talk . The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton 's studio - or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he did n't work there himself - and joined the life_class , which met every Tuesday and <head>Thursday</head> from ten to twelve in the morning . It was an awkward hour , but I did n't have to punch any time_clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a_couple_of hours later at the drawing_board to finish_up a job . After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they would n't feel lonely , and we used_to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading `` out to work '' . It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us .</context>
