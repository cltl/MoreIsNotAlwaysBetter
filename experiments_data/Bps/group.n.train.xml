Rabb , the former Louisiana_State field_general , came_off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22 - 12 upset victory over the <head>Houston_Oilers</head> , defending league champions . `` Just our luck '' ! exclaimed Stram . `` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just_as we head that way '' . Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned_in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack_Spikes , though he did the team 's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury .</context>

      <context> A Texas halfback who does n't even know the team 's plays , Eldon_Moritz , ranks fourth in <head>Southwest_Conference</head> scoring after three games . Time stands_still every time Moritz , a 26 - year old Army_Signal_Corps veteran , goes_into the field . Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick - several every Saturday , in_fact - out of football . Moritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip_pads but he 's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the cotton_bowl .</context>

One of the roughest was the TV quiz shows , which gave him inferiority_complexes . Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned_out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many_another intelligent , well-informed American . But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $ 2000000 profit on the stock_market .</context>

      <context> Stacked_heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes . Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps . While white is the coolest summer shade , there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color . In the tintable <head>group</head> are high and little heels , squared and oval throats , and shantung like textures . Do n't overlook the straws this year . They come in crisp basket_weaves in natural honey hues , along with lacy open weaves with a lustre finish in natural , white , black and a whole range of colors . In the casual field straws feature wedge_heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles .</context>

      <context> Flats have a scalloped throat . An electric_toothbrush ( Broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric_razor in the American bathroom . The brush moves up_and_down and is small enough to clean every dental surface , including the back of the teeth . In_addition , the motor has the seal_of_approval of the <head>Underwriters_Laboratories</head> , which means it is safe . The unit consists_of a small motor that goes_on as_soon_as it is plugged_in . The speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index_finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor . The brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so_that every member of the family can have his own .</context>

      <context> And in England , after the Restoration , the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn . The head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster , and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows . Contemplating these posthumous punishments , Stalin should not lose all hope . In 1899 , <head>Parliament</head> erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster , facing Whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands . Nikita_Khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself . The Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy , Moscow is a crowded city , and the creed of communism deplores waste . Who will take Stalin 's place beside Lenin ?</context>

      <context> If some future Khrushchev decided to rake_up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory_workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ? When a man is laid_to_rest , he is entitled to stay_put . If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand . The appointment of U_Thant of Burma as the <head>U.N.'s</head> Acting Secretary_General - at this writing , the choice appears to be certain - offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends . Mongi_Slim of Tunisia and Frederick_Boland of Ireland were early favorites in_the_running , but France did n't like the former and the Soviet_Union would have none of the latter . With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr._Hammarskjold , U_Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto . What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy .</context>

      <context> U_Thant of_course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when Mr._Hammarskjold 's term would have come to an end . Whether the compromises - on both sides - that made_possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen . Mr._Khrushchev 's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ; the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U_Thant represents . In_a_sense , the showdown promised by Mr._Hammarskjold 's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; no precedents have been set as_yet ; structurally , the <head>U.N.</head> is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing_to_bear upon it . But at_least the pessimists who believed that the world_organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong . No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade .

      <context> `` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' . Morrison points_out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet_Union or Red_China , it is the most vulnerable of the great_powers - Europe of_course must be written_off out_of_hand . He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United_States is the least risky path our government can take . His proposal is opposed to that of Richard_Nixon , Governor_Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the <head>Atomic_Energy_Commission</head> , Dr._Edward_Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold_war . These gentlemen are calling_for a resumption of testing - in the atmosphere - on the greatest possible scale , all in_the_name_of national security .

      <context> The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas , for_example , will provide needed space for the extra television_sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids . Also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented . It 's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse . He does n't really need the immense sum_of_money ( probably converted from American gold on the <head>London_Exchange</head> ) he makes them pay . For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot . He has a glorious wife and many children . When he needs money to buy something like , say , the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable_patch , he takes_a_flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies .</context>

      <context> One of the local callers , a retired brigadier apparently left_over from Kipling 's tales of India , does not approve of the way Larkin gets his birds . He does n't think that potting them from a deck_chair on the south_side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting . But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish . It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel_de_Cervantes ' `` Don_Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide_screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth_Street and <head>Sixty-eighth_Street_Playhouses</head> . More_than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho_Panza , in seventeenth century Spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . Nikolai_Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander_Nevsky and Ivan_the_Terrible , performs the lanky Don_Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . His addle-brained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no_doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues .</context>

      <context> Directionality is greatly exaggerated most_of the time ; but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music . You definitely hear some of the instruments close_up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back . This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound . <head>London</head> explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels . These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record . In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special_effects . Some clue to the character of London 's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion '' or `` percussive '' .</context>

The party at Floyd 's penthouse gave the `` chorines '' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era 's nonsense . LaGuardia 's multi lingual rallies , when he is running for <head>Congress</head> , are well staged , and wind_up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical_theater .

The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture Protestantism '' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches . In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at_hand - and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation . This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman_Vincent_Peale 's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel .</context>

      <context> It should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics ( one paper writes 50 per_cent ) . Still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing . An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true . A century ago , Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on <head>English_Protestantism</head> , and that even high_Anglicanism would someday no_longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own '' . That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' . One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite . Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy .</context>

The engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result . Too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment . The <head>Command</head> technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration . Your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score . It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high_fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener . The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope since Feyer 's four-sided LP edition of 1958 for Angel ) , this set is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment .</context>

The home listener is overpowered , all_right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one .</context>

      <context> Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation . In these readings , the double_bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown 's attire - the musical equivalent of a bull_in_a_china_shop . Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances . The occasion for this marathon : <head>Angel</head> 's long awaited reissue in its `` Great_Recordings_of_the_Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro_Arte version . Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . Whether considered alone or in_relation_to other editions , COLH 40 is a document of prime importance . Artur_Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable .</context>

      <context> This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .

The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives . About the <head>Pro_Arte</head> 's contribution I am less happy . I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group .

      <context> Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought_out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout . Some of Curzon 's playing strikes me as finicky , however . Why , for_example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ? The assisting musicians from the <head>Vienna_Octet</head> are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing . ( Special compliments to the double_bass playing of Johann_Krumpp : his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance . ) The Glazer-Fine_Arts edition ( Concert-Disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization .</context>

      <context> Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not_only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it . In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university 's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist . However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals . In 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the <head>Copenhagen_University</head> , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 . During Oersted 's attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences . He was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof._J._G._L._Manthey ( 1769 - 1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in_addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` Lion_Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him . Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted 's disposal during and after his graduation .</context>

      <context> This , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior_design to the many subjects of their home_economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior_design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior_design . In_spite_of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject . There will be no mitigation of these offences until all art_schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation - as do medical_schools - by an art accreditation group such_as the `` National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art '' . Independent art_schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional <head>group</head> .</context>

      <context> The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior_designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference_of_opinion . The architects do not believe that the education of the interior_designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both <head>groups</head> and who has sat through the many round_tables , workshops or panel_discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled_down crux_of_the_matter is education . It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior_designer 's training .</context>

      <context> Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions . When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep . If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real_life . Dr._H._V._Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the <head>University_of_Pennsylvania</head> , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification . As_a_matter_of_fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr._Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day . Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest 's information . Dr._Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream .</context>

      <context> One day Maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in_advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified . Rudyard_Kipling 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ? The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something_About_Myself . One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in <head>Westminster_Abbey</head> his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more_than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation_Of_Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' .</context>

      <context> Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative . Unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated . Generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife 's mercy . `` The pattern '' , says Dr._Morton_Schillinger , psychologist at New_York 's <head>Lincoln_Institute_for_Psychotherapy</head> , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night '' . No one seriously contends , of_course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world . After_all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as Dr._Schillinger points_out . There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master_bedroom .</context>

      <context> `` The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' . Other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage . And just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband . `` To get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments Dr._Schillinger of the <head>Lincoln_Institute</head> , `` the husband must take some very basic steps . He must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish . He must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding '' ' . Too many husbands , Dr._Schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they 're doing '' , and fear that their success depends_on some trick or technique of sexual play .</context>

      <context> They consider it simply a sign of our times . Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority . It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role . `` The sexual_relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , declares Dr._Mary_Steichen_Calderone , medical director of the <head>Planned_Parenthood_Federation_of_America</head> and author of the recent book , Release From Sexual Tensions . `` It reflects what is going_on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself . A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual_relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too '' . Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous .</context>

Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing - and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them . One wife , described by a New_York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual_relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly <head>PTA</head> meetings and the Thursday night neighborhood card parties . Another put sex on a dollars and cents basis . After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband 's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor .

For_instance : In Chicago , some time ago , Mr._H. , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike '' - a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent - sold by the <head>Vrilium_Company</head> of Chicago for $ 306 as a cure-all . `` Hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy , and its rays will cure any disease you have '' , said the company . Mr._H. is dead today because he followed this advice . Doris_Hull , suffering from tuberculosis , was taken by her husband to see Otis_G._Carroll , a sanipractor - a licensed drugless healer - in Spokane .</context>

      <context> Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states . Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and <head>groups</head> , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the nations .</context>

From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth century American folklore .

The popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American_War , the steady currency of the Lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass_media are cases_in_point . Nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of American life , that learned societies such_as the American_Folklore_Society and the <head>American_Historical_Association</head> were founded in the 1880's , or that courses in American literature , American civilization , American anything have swept our school and college curricula . Of_course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth century United_States . Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man_in_the_street . It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine .</context>

      <context> It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine . After_all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control . Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement . Such identification comes for each <head>group</head> in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes . In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose . A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever_changing land . But we must never forget , most_of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends .</context>

      <context> Therefore , the scholar , as he looks_at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts . 1 ) Most_of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at_all . 2 ) The concept that an `` American national folklore '' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend . Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous <head>group</head> of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission . It has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression . Related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence . Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter .</context>

      <context> Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter . In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this . Enthusiastically , Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul_Bunyan tales , Abe_Lincoln anecdotes and labor_union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition . Nor have we remembered that in the melting_pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational <head>groups</head> did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material . Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant . As_long_as his material is Americana , can in_some_way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied .</context>

      <context> Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs ; the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance . The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami_Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3000 feet . Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands . The tsunami warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander_C._K._Green of the <head>Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey</head> staff . It consists_of a series of pipes and a pressure measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface . Ordinary water tides are disregarded . But when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set_in_motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric_circuit .</context>

      <context> The vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while Jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed .

In upper teen Jewish life , the non college <head>group</head> tends to have a sense of marginality . `` People automatically assume that I 'm in college '' , a nineteen year old machinist observed irritably . However , among the girls , there are some morale enhancing compensations for not going_to college .

      <context> All this is simple enough , but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before . Each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , Porter 's camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play . The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen . If the change , at_first_sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the Italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant <head>group</head> of geniuses any art has seen . In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as_well_as a mechanical recording device . He did more than that . He revealed the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film .</context>

      <context> They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers . The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit '' of Protestant religious life ; in_fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal '' Roman_Catholic parish . We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection . The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic <head>group</head> identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members . The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations . There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world .</context>

      <context> In_general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis ; congregational membership , however , is another thing . A congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; that_is , when it can preserve economic integration . Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping <head>group</head> requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining ; the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition . The breakdown of social homogeneity in inner_city areas and the spread of inner_city blight account_for the decline of central_city churches . Central_cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations : ( 1 ) central_cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social_classes ; ( 2 ) central_cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition .</context>

      <context> I am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal 's attitude toward the South . It appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends . His assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at_least partly in_sympathy_with his views . <head>Time</head> 's editor , Thomas_Griffith , in his book , The Waist High Culture , wrote : `` most of what was different about it ( the Deep_South ) I found myself unsympathetic to '' . This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement . Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism . I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North .</context>

      <context> I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand_out quite clearly . They are in_general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual . They include both individual fears and collective ones . They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not_only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or <head>group</head> . Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized . Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act . To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .</context>

Henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe 's older and more serious brother , Morris , who was just_about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa , when he substituted for Rabbi_Jastrow at Rodeph_Shalom_Temple there during its Rabbi 's absence in Europe . Young Morris , who , while attending the University_of_Pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write Henrietta twenty page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of Sarah_Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` Sulamith '' on the Jewish reform_movement being promulgated by the <head>Hebrew_Union_College</head> in Cincinnati . Unlike his younger brother , Joe , he never presumed_to address her more familiarly than as `` My dear friend '' , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style . And when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and Papa did . One thing Papa had not taught Henrietta was how to handle a young_man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself .</context>

And when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and Papa did . One thing Papa had not taught Henrietta was how to handle a young_man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself . She could not resist the opportunity `` of showing her superiority in argument over a man '' which she had remarked as one of the `` feminine follies '' of Sara_Sullam ; and in her forthright way , Henrietta , who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think_of men as the privileged '' and `` women as submissive and yielding '' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris_Jastrow took the slightest exception - he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair , as_well_as on the radical reforms of Dr._Wise of <head>Hebrew_Union_College</head> - until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given_up hope they would ever agree on anything . But that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard_Street . `` We 've got Father and Mother and each_other , '' said Beth on the first page of Louisa_Alcott 's Little_Women ; and , `` I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world '' , burst_out Jo some five_hundred pages later in that popular story of the March family , which had first appeared when Henrietta was eight ; and the Szold family , as it developed , bore a striking resemblance to the Marches . Mr._March , like Benjamin_Szold , was a clergyman , although of an indeterminate denomination ; and `` Marmee '' March , like Sophie_Szold , was the competent manager of her brood of girls , of whom the Marches had only four to the Szolds ' five .</context>

Adele , like Amy , the youngest of the Marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one . For Rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls - and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones - there was no particular March counterpart ; but both <head>groups</head> were so closely_knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content - the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian . The Szolds , like the Marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ; and , as in the March home , any young_man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them .

      <context> Under her father 's influence it did not occur to Henrietta that she might write_on subjects outside the Jewish field , but she did begin writing for other Anglo_Jewish papers and thus increased her output and her audience . And she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of Judas_Maccabeus performed at the Hanukkah festival which came in December .

      <context> One day in a bar , so the legend goes , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monocle and broke it . The innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of honor found in bars , insisted upon replacing the destroyed monocle - and did , over the protests of the former owner - with a square monocle . Mercer is_supposed_to have refused it with , `` Anyone who wears a square monocle must be affected '' ! Everett_Miller , then assistant director for the Garrick_Gaieties , a <head>Theatre_Guild</head> production , needed a lyricist for a song he had written ; he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however . For him Mercer produced the lyric to `` Out_of_Breath_Scared_to_Death_of_You '' , introduced in that most successful of all the Gaieties , by Sterling_Holloway . This 1930 edition also had songs in it by Vernon_Duke and Ira_Gershwin , by E._Y._Harburg and Duke , and by Harry_Myers .

With her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music - though she waited until he was ten - beginning with the piano and following that with the trumpet . Young Mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instruments . Still , he did like music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the <head>Woodberry_Forest_School</head> , near Orange , Virginia , where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well . When he was fifteen John_H._Mercer turned_out his first song , a jazzy little thing he called `` Sister_Susie , Strut_Your_Stuff '' .

      <context> Hegel 's profound admiration for the insights of the Greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth century philosophy .

      <context> Results of_this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which OH may be identified in interstellar gas ; the frequencies are 1665.32 and 1667.36 * * f , with an uncertainty of 0.10 * * f . Success in observing these spectral lines has so_far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ; extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported . Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals . The <head>Bureau</head> is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 * * f . The efforts and accomplishments fall_into three main categories : absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors , and helium 4 vapor-pressure measurements ( see p. 144 ) . An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the thermometric fluid , to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 * * f . Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute_temperature measurement , and may be used as_an_alternative to the gas_thermometer .</context>

In_fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment . Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought_home to all_of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home . Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United_States , violate the Monroe_Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin_American republic .</context>

Once the full extent of_this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President_Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone . But the Latin_American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the <head>Inter-American_Defense_Board</head> . For years the United_States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro 's representative from secret military talks . But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job . There is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week .</context>

Mr._Speaker , in my latest newsletter to my constituents I urged the imposition of a naval_blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from coming into the Western_Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe_Doctrine . Yesterday , I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U._S._News_+_World_Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its disadvantages .</context>

The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation_program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social_Security_Act in 1935 .

The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational_rehabilitation_program , providing_for a three part grant structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational_rehabilitation - and in_addition for short-term training and instruction . The first part of the new structure - that for supporting the basic program of vocational_rehabilitation services - is described in this Section .</context>

      <context> - The deterrent power of our Armed_Forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war . The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers , carrier based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles . The second capability is represented by our deployed ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement . The <head>Strategic_Air_Command</head> is the principal element of our long_range nuclear capability . One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the B-70 , a long range supersonic bomber .

Retired pay costs are increased by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel . These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $ 56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the <head>Army_Reserve</head> components during 1961 . Traditionally , rates_of_pay for retired military_personnel have been proportionate to current rates_of_pay for active personnel . The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing_for a 6 % increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958 .

The ratio of the measured antenna temperature_change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85 .</context>

      <context> In 1948 , Afranio_do_Amaral , the noted Brazilian herpetologist , wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes .

Thus , his estimate lies between Oliver 's suggestion of at_least 37 feet and the 50 - foot `` monstrous freaks '' intimated by Heuvelmans .

Accordingly , if epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche , early and late menarches might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for the 18 girls with `` same schedule '' . As an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion . It is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this <head>group</head> .

      <context> The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early_childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . Second , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . Although the standard_deviation values on which spread of the lines are based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . Third , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other <head>groups</head> of children . The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . It is convenient to classify a child 's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according_to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line . When a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classified according_to the position of the dot with_respect_to the vertical marking denoting the mean age .</context>

The emotional_states produced by drugs influence the cortical_potentials in a characteristic manner ; synchrony prevails in the EEG of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizers , but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive_drugs .

Other classes are included only by myself ( interrogatives , adverbs ) or only by Swadesh and Hoijer ( pronouns , demonstratives ) . What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes : ( 1 ) body_parts and products , which with a proportionally nearly even representation ( 51 terms out of 253 , 25 out of 100 ) come_out with nearly even ratios ; 2.6 and 2.7 ; ( 2 ) Nature ( 29 terms against 17 ) , ratios 3.3 versus 4.1 ; ( 3 ) adjectives ( 16 , 15 terms ) , ratios 3.9 versus 4.7 ; ( 4 ) verbs ( 9 , 22 terms ) , ratios 4.0 versus 3.4 . It will be seen that where the scope is similar , the Athabascan ratios come_out somewhat higher ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4 : 5 ) except for verbs , where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower .</context>

      <context> The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections . Although the elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates . With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly . Both parties and the <head>Ministry_of_the_Interior</head> were busily at_work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance . Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation . The general setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization . The concentration of effective power in Rabat leads not_only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in_addition to contributing to more meaningful elections .</context>

      <context> The parties were on_the_whole unprepared for elections , while the people were still experiencing post independence let-down and suffering the after_effects of poor harvests in 1957 . Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue . They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held . But the eagerly sought `` homogeneity '' of the Balafrej <head>Council_of_Government</head> was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled over foreign_policy , labor politics and economic development . By December , 1958 , when ' Abdallah_Ibrahim became President_of_the_Council , elections had even greater importance . They were increasingly looked_upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new , constructive national effort . To minimize the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government was formed a titre personnel and a special office was created in the Ministry_of_the_Interior to plan and to conduct the elections .</context>

      <context> There remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws through the labyrinth of Palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions . From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results . In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance . In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political <head>group</head> hopes that the elections will give them new prominence , but in a system where there is as_yet no place for the less prominent . Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide , minority parties , such_as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958 , clamor for elections when out of power , but are not at_all certain they wish_to be controlled by popular choice when in power . Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process . The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco .</context>

      <context> Furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys . Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded_as more hypothetical . While the U._S. Department_of_Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning . The U._S. <head>Office_of_Education</head> continues to stress local surveys rather_than national surveys . This procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment . Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in_order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training_programs for those skills . No effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained .</context>

      <context> However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment . Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . This probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment_compensation or a <head>Youth_Conservation_Corps</head> . A maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from home . A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor . Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training .</context>

      <context> Cattle stealing and killing , again serious during the spring of 1891 , placed the land_grant company officers in a perplexing position . They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property , thus running_the_risk of creating disturbances such_as that on the Vermejo , and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle_thieves and running_the_risk of being shot . And the law virtually ignored the situation . The judge became ill just as the <head>Colfax_District_Court</head> convened , no substitute was brought_in , no criminal cases heard , only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried , and court adjourned sine_die after sitting a_few days instead_of the usual three weeks .

      <context> These were the years when people flocked to Manchester not_only to play golf , which had come into vogue , but also to witness the Ekwanok Country_Club tournaments . New_Yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers . This boosted local telegraph business and Manchester basked in all the free advertising . In 1914 when the town was chosen for the <head>U._S._Amateur_Golf</head> tournament , a representative hurried here from the Boston manager 's office . In his wake came the District_Traffic_Supervisor and the cream of the telegraphic profession , ten of Boston 's best , chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge of golf . During that tournament alone , some 250000 words winged their way out of Manchester . The old Morse system was replaced locally by the Simplex modern automatic method in 1929 , when Ellamae_Heckman ( Wilcox ) was manager of the Western_Union office .</context>

      <context> More believed that a man could be both serious and gay . That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all_too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of . Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of <head>Christ_Church</head> and Regius_Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance_English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . But to return to the main line of our inquiry . It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr . Utopia is still widely read because in_a_sense More stood on the margin of modernity .</context>

      <context> On Wednesday evening , November 23 , 1859 , in Warren , Rev._Mark_Trafton of New_Bedford , gave a `` Mission_of_Sympathy '' lecture in which he favorably viewed the Harper_'s_Ferry insurrection . The Warren_Telegraph stated that many of Rev._Trafton 's remarks were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism .

      <context> All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so_as to encompass fictive space in_front of the surface as_well_as behind it . Flatness may now monopolize everything , but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn_into illusion itself - at_least an optical if_not , properly_speaking , a pictorial illusion . Depicted , Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal , undepicted kind , but at_the_same_time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind - and it does so , moreover , without depriving the latter of its literalness ; rather , it underpins and reinforces that literalness , re-creates it . Out of_this re-created literalness , the <head>Cubist</head> subject reemerged . For it had turned_out , by a further paradox of Cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging . In the Analytical phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not_only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in_order to preserve it ; they had also had to generalize it - to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as_such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself . In_order to be saved , plasticity had had to be isolated ; and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more_or_less interchangeable and contour obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method , the subject itself became largely unrecognizable .</context>

      <context> Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easier than to the downtown department_store , though both are the same distance from home . Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown . Raymond_Vernon reports that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of <head>Lazarus_Brothers</head> in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the lot next_door . If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened_away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program . And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble . Today , according_to land economist Homer_Hoyt , shopping_centers and their associated parking_lots cover some 46000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land_area in all the nation 's Central Business_Districts put together .</context>

      <context> Historically in America the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered . `` How ya gonna keep ' em down on the farm '' ? was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree .

Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central_city would be likely to destroy this preference - and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians , is actually upon us . In their book American_Skyline , Christopher_Tunnard and Henry_Hope_Reed argue that Franklin_Roosevelt 's New_Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility - a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote . The first superhighways - New_York 's Henry_Hudson and Chicago 's Lake_Shore , San_Francisco 's Bay_Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania_Turnpike - were built as part of the federal works_program which was going_to cure the depression .</context>

Not_only was Haumd 's intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in_stride . For_example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest F major register up_to a barely audible N minor in four seconds , not skipping , at_the_same_time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist 's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage .</context>
