      <context> In New_York_City in 1958 , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive_device . He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman_Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy . A year later in Albany , N._Y. , a Roman_Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned_Parenthood_Association . Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged <head>invasion</head> of a man 's right to freedom of religious_belief and conscience . These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue . It has flared_up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family welfare agencies . It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries .</context>

      <context> And no_doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors . All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did . Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the <head>invasion</head> , and Reconstruction ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties . But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South - to use the moderate words favored by Mr._Thomas_Griffith - finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North . And this , in_effect , means most of modern America . It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise .</context>

      <context> His ideal was Alexander_of_Macedon , as Napoleon 's was Julius_Caesar . His purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice . Each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god . Each failed catastrophically in an <head>invasion</head> of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him . Each is still glorified as a national hero . The first half of The_Charles_Men , ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second . After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .</context>

      <context> Like Napoleon , he was the worst of losers . There are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity . Then more_than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness . This comes_out in `` When_the_Bells_Ring '' , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an <head>invasion</head> by the Danes . In `` The_King 's_Ride '' , Charles breaks_out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from Turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years . He finds it in utter misery and desolation . All his people ask for is no more war .</context>
