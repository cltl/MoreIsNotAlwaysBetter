      <context> The aspects of physical development that catch the judges ' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion - superior definition of the muscles . Now good definition is one thing that all_of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light weight workouts . But contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor 's chisel - is something quite different . This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep <head>training</head> , but from certain definition specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him . Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others . Because they are `` minority '' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten . Only when the newest Mr._America or Mr._Universe rediscovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once_again see how effective they really are .</context>

It is more than just lack of dance <head>training</head> that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics . Taking first things first , let 's understand the sport called gymnastics . It is made_up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run_through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work .

      <context> Very little in today 's living provides the strength we need , and nothing provides the flexibility . Dancers do have flexibility . They often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength . Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical <head>training</head> they have had , will be very disappointing . Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas . This is n't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11 - year old boys in America cannot chin themselves once , and that English school_girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) . The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw .</context>

Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of <head>training</head> , counseling , and placement on a job . Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78_th_Congress in 1943 passed P._L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure . Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) .</context>

His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit . This is brought_out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United_States ; and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds .</context>

      <context> During World_War 2 , about 7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) Vocational Education for National Defense , and ( 2 ) War Production Training . The total cost of the five year program was $ 297 million . For the Smith-Hughes , George-Barden , and National_Defense_Act of 1958 , the cumulative total of Federal expenditures in 42 years was only about $ 740 million .
