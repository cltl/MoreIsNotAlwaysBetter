      <context> He seems to have at_least a_few 30 - and 50 - megaton_bombs on_hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock . And now , of_course , the hue_and_cry for counter escalation is being raised on our side . Khrushchev threatens us with a 100 - megaton_bomb ? So_be_it - then we must embark_on a crash program for 200 - megaton_bombs of the common or <head>hydrogen</head> variety , and neutron_bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing . So escalation proceeds , ad_infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead_of on their respective proving_grounds . What is needed , Philip_Morrison writes in The_Cornell_Daily_Sun ( October 26 ) is a discontinuity . The escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon .</context>

      <context> Under the sponsorship of the Office_of_Naval_Research and the Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency , a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities . An exhaustive survey was made of the literature , and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued . Selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation . A wall stabilized high current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic <head>hydrogen</head> and oxygen . This apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large_number of other elements . A study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about * * f percent . A set of tables containing spectral intensities for 39000 lines of 70 elements , as observed in a copper matrix in a d-c arc , was completed and published .</context>

      <context> During the discharge the magnetic_forces set_up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center_line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera . Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60 - 80 microseconds . The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil . Besides the well-known <head>hydrogen</head> line at 21 cm wavelength , the spectra of extraterrestrial radio_sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small molecules . The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres . Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH ; somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH , SiH , and ScH . Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ; in interstellar gas , concentrations as low as * * f molecules / * * f may be sufficient , as compared to the * * f hydrogen_atoms * * f required for detection of the 21 - cm line .</context>

      <context> The experimental second_moment **f conforms_to the relation **f in_agreement with theory . Hence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) . The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes . The nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the <head>hydrogen</head> nuclei , but the symmetry of the **f bond in **f remains in doubt . The magnetic_moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic_resonance properties of nuclei . It is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear_resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure . **f appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters , since it is a normal paramagnet , with three unpaired electrons on the chromium , its crystal structure is very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong **f bond provides structural interest .</context>
