      <context> `` No '' , said the official . `` You must play it where it lies '' . `` You 're wrong '' , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules . `` I 'll do as you say , but I 'll also play a provisional ball and get a <head>ruling</head> '' . He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . The golfing fathers ruled_in his favor . So he picked_up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke .</context>

      <context> Three requirements go_with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; and it must be enforced without discrimination . Once these conditions of international_law are met , countries that try to run to blockade do so at their own risk . Blockade runners can be stopped - by gunfire , if necessary - searched and held , at_least temporarily . They could be sent to U._S. ports for <head>rulings</head> whether cargo should be confiscated . Plenty , say the experts . In a broad sense , it would reaffirm the Monroe_Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western_Hemisphere . It could , by avoiding direct intervention , provide a short-of war strategy to meet short-of war infiltration .</context>

      <context> Christiana_Securities_Company and Delaware_Realty_+_Investment_Company , major stockholders in du_Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten year period , of du_Pont 's General_Motors stock allocable to them , as_well_as any General_Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright . If , in the trustee 's judgment , `` reasonable market conditions '' did not prevail during any given year , he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten year period . In_addition , the right_to_vote the General_Motors stock held by du_Pont was to be vested in du_Pont 's stockholders , other_than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware ; du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over General_Motors ; du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in_common with General_Motors , and vice_versa ; and General_Motors and du_Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided_for the purchase by General_Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du_Pont manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent_rights , or for a grant by General_Motors to du_Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General_Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial_enterprise by the two companies . On motion of the amici_curiae , the court directed that a <head>ruling</head> be obtained from the Commissioner_of_Internal_Revenue as to the federal income_tax consequences of the Government 's plan . On May 9 , 1958 , the Commissioner announced his rulings . The annual dividends paid to du_Pont stockholders in shares of General_Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of du_Pont 's earnings and profits . The measure , for federal income_tax purposes , of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market_value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution .</context>

In the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders , the measure would be the lesser of the fair market_value of the shares or du_Pont 's tax basis for them , which is approximately $ 2.09 per share .</context>
