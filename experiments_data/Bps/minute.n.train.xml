      <context> Mr._Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now famous Weider_Push-Pull_Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . So right_away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull_Super-Set consisting_of the wide grip Straight-Arm_Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull_Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib_cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar Bench_Press which specifically works_on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids . As you can see , in this Push-Pull_Super_Set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises , so the complete torso remains pumped-up all_the_time ! Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 1 , the professor allows him about a five <head>minute</head> rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 2 . Super-Set No. 2 is made_up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat_benches . The `` push '' exercise of this Push-Pull_Super-Set is the Bench_Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation . You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs .</context>

      <context> The tsunami warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander_C._K._Green of the Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey staff . It consists_of a series of pipes and a pressure measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface . Ordinary water tides are disregarded . But when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 <head>minutes</head> begin to roll over the ocean , they set_in_motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric_circuit . This in_turn sets_off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress . Such equipment has been installed at Hilo , Midway , Attu and Dutch_Harbor . The moment the alarm goes_off , information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu , which is the center of the warning system .</context>

One reel - from eight to twelve <head>minutes</head> - became the standard length from the year of Robbery , 1903 , until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth_of_a_Nation in 1915 . The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies .

      <context> The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not_only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; these films and these sequences are also seeking_out - instinctively or by_design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative . There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . The man was D.W._Griffith . When he came to the movies - more_or_less by accident - they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few <head>minutes</head> . In about seven years Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film_maker .

In response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion_picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day . Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at_heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short_story . Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .</context>

The_Breeze_And_Chancellor_Neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concerns the attempts of a West German politician to woo a plaster_cast of the Apollo_Belvedere . As you have doubtless guessed already , the plot is plastered with Freudian , Jungian , and Meinckian theory . For_example , when the film is only four <head>minutes</head> old , Neitzbohr refers to a small , Victorian piano_stool as `` Wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano_stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of_course , was Doris ( the English equivalent , when passed_through middle Gaelic derivations , of Wilhelmina ) . For the remainder of the movie , Chancellor_Neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano_stool with a slat from a Venetian_blind that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag . In this manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt_pangs caused by his personal assaults against the_English at Dunkirk . As we find_out at the end , it is not the stool ( symbolizing Doris , therefore the_English ) that he is punishing but the piece of Venetian_blind .</context>
