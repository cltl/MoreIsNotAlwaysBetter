      <context> Also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented . It 's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse . He does n't really need the immense sum_of_money ( probably converted from American gold on the London_Exchange ) he makes them pay . For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his <head>lot</head> . He has a glorious wife and many children . When he needs money to buy something like , say , the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable_patch , he takes_a_flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies . One of those capital-gains ventures , in_fact , has saddled him with Gore_Court .</context>

I spade <head>lots</head> of compost into their bed ; lacking that , decayed manure spread_over the bed is fine . One year I simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile , to which a_little sand had been added , and I had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my neighbors ' experience . In_addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every_other week , diluted to the color of weak tea . As a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used .</context>

The disasters of 1825 - 1826 caused more to leave . After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick . In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June .</context>

      <context> The battle of the Naktong_River is just one example of how the battle_cry and the spirit of The Fighting_Seventh have paid_off . For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment . Take the case of Major_Marcus_A._Reno , who survived the Battle_of_The_Little_Big_Horn in 1876 . From the enlisted_men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a <head>lot</head> of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus_Reno . Many_of his fellow officers refused to speak_to him . But when a board of inquiry was called to look_into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him . He was a member of The Fighting_Seventh .</context>

      <context> For several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship . The stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress . Children , conditioned by this mistaken notion , have feared stepmothers , while adults , by their antagonistic attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one . Debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the <head>lot</head> of the stepchild a happier one . Research , on_the_other_hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers . Helen_Deutsch informed us ( The_Psychology_of_Women , Vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many . Will mere debate on that proposition , even_though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ?</context>

      <context> Mathematically , we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times . These examples are illustrative of the use of the words `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are used in this chapter , but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to restrict them too narrowly . Ten students act_as managers for a high-school football_team , and of these managers a proportion p are licensed drivers . Each Friday one manager is chosen by <head>lot</head> to stay late and load the equipment on a truck . On three Fridays the coach has needed a driver . Considering only these Fridays , what is the probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times ? Exactly 2 times ?</context>

      <context> Note that there are 3 trials of interest . Each trial consists_of choosing a student manager at_random . The 2 possible outcomes on each trial are `` driver '' or `` nondriver '' . Since the choice is by <head>lot</head> each_week , the outcomes of different trials are independent . The managers stay the same , so that * * f is the same for all weeks . We now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments . For an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment , it must have four properties : ( 1 ) there must be a fixed number of trials , ( 2 ) each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' ( a binomial trial ) , ( 3 ) all trials must have identical probabilities of success , ( 4 ) the trials must be independent of each other .</context>

      <context> whether there is such fitness or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do . Let me illustrate . In his novel The_House_of_the_Dead , Dostoevsky tells of his experiences in a Siberian prison_camp . Whatever the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today , Dostoevsky 's companions were about as grim a <head>lot</head> as can be imagined . `` I have heard stories '' , he writes , `` of the most terrible , the most unnatural actions , of the most monstrous murders , told with the most spontaneous , childishly merry laughter '' . Most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very unfitting . If we were asked why we thought so , we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong , and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting .</context>

      <context> Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easier than to the downtown department_store , though both are the same distance from home . Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown . Raymond_Vernon reports that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the <head>lot</head> next_door . If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened_away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program . And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble . Today , according_to land economist Homer_Hoyt , shopping_centers and their associated parking_lots cover some 46000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land_area in all the nation 's Central Business_Districts put together .</context>
