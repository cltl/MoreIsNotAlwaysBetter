      <context> Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting_up Tuttle 's 390 - foot homer over the wall in left center . If the Orioles are to break their losing_streak within the next two days , it will have to be at_the_expense_of the American_League champion New_York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night_game and a single test Sunday afternoon . The flavor of Baltimore 's Florida_Grapefruit_League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron_Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army 's military training_program and is ready for belated spring_training . Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove_in 86 runs on a .255 freshman <head>average</head> , completes the Birds ' spring squad at 49 players . The big , 22 - year old shortstop , the 1960 American_league `` rookie of the year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $ 15000 and was a spectator at tonight 's 5 - to 3 loss to Kansas_City - the winless Birds ' sixth setback in_a_row . The 6 - foot 3 inch Hansen checked_in close_to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting_weight last spring . He hopes to melt_off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks_camp three weeks hence .</context>

      <context> Texas ' 545 - yard spree against Washington_State gave the Longhorns a 3 - game total offense of 1512 yards ( 1065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high . Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A+M , with a 38 - point bulge against Texas_Tech ran_up its biggest total loop play since 1950 . Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards . Texas leads in per game rushing <head>averages</head> , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor 's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas ' 189 ) . A+M has the best defense against passes , 34.7 yards per game . Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in_use , the major_leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in_progress at Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology .</context>

      <context> The record_books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace . In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as_many_as 25 home_runs and stole as_many_as 25 bases . Once the figure was 30 - 30 . Willie 's lifetime batting <head>average</head> of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's . The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick_Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park . It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . THE DENVER-AREA TV_audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home_runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob_Howsam that the games are not to be blacked_out when his Bears are playing at_home .</context>

      <context> `` I 've had it '' , he told a newsman . `` I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going_to be any 25th man on the ball_club '' . This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout . Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a .130 batting <head>average</head> in the first 12 games . He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across_the_nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe_Ann_Olsen , awaited .

      <context> Our pitching is much better than it has shown '' . The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch_Stadium yesterday . Until the Bucs ' bats quieted_down a_bit in Cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over .300 . Despite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of <head>averages</head> : Smoky_Burgess .455 , Gino_Cimoli .389 , Bill_Virdon .340 , Bob_Clemente and Dick_Groat , each .323 , Dick_Stuart .306 , Don_Hoak .280 and Bob_Skinner .267 . Bill_Mazeroski with .179 and Hal_Smith with .143 were the only Pirates dragging_their_feet . Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit_out most of the series is Bob_Friend , who was beaten by The_Man twice last season on dramatic home_runs . Friend is off to a great start with a 4 - 0 record but is n't likely to see action here this week .</context>

      <context> If a nation wished to get a head_start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large_number of the problems that plague American schools . First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both . Oddly_enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty . Certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic <head>averages</head> , since alert children work better . Russia knows this , and that is why there were over 800000 competing for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team . Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try_for the team itself . We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people .</context>

      <context> One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1 , 1755 ; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far_away as the English coast . Tsunami are rare , however , in the Atlantic_Ocean ; they are far more common in the Pacific . Japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 . The Hawaiian_Islands are struck severely an <head>average</head> of once every 25 years . In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland_Sea ; one wave swamped more than 1000 ships and boats in Osaka_Bay . A tsunami in the Hawaiian_Islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( Ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been . In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 27000 people and swept_away 10000 homes .</context>

Practically all the people of Laos , he explained - about two million of them - are rice farmers , and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows .

      <context> He claimed 4_,_-_D classification as a minister of religion , devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching . On November 13 , 1952 , he was classified in Class 1 , -_A . On November 22 , 1952 , he wrote the Board , protesting this classification . He again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; that he was `` devoting an <head>average</head> of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in_addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties , and that he opposed war in any form . Thereafter he was classified 1_,_-_O . On April 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board . In a periodic review , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1_,_-_A and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home .</context>

      <context> The result of the observations is ( in ` K ) **f where the phase angle , |qt , is measured in degrees from new_moon and the probable errors include absolute as_well_as relative errors . This result is plotted along with the 8.6 - mm observations of Gibson ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , a . The variation in the 3 - cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very_much less_than the variation in the 8.6 - mm emission , as would be expected from the explanation of Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) . In the discussion which follows , the time <head>average</head> of the radio_emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component . The 10.3 - cm observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20 , 1958 , using the 84 - foot reflector at the Maryland_Point_Observatory of the U.S._Naval_Research_Laboratory . The age of the moon was about 2 days . The half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about 18 ' .5 , and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a Gaussian_shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon .</context>

A brood of twenty-eight born at Brookfield_Zoo , near Chicago , ranged in_length from 22 to 33 - 1 2 inches and averaged 29 inches . Lawrence_E_._Griffin gives measurements of nineteen young anacondas , presumably members of a brood , from `` South_America '' ; the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower_limit of the Brookfield brood and its <head>average</head> . Raymond_L_._Ditmars had two broods that averaged 27 inches . R_._R_._Mole and F_._W_._Urich give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the Orinoco estuaries . William_Beebe reports 26 inches and 2.4 ounces ( this snake must have been emaciated ) for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from British_Guiana .</context>

      <context> Figure 2 is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group . As predicted , the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly ( * * f ) than those in the structured schools . The interaction effect , which is significant at the .01 level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores . While high anxiety children achieve significantly less well ( * * f ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children , they appear to do at_least as well as the <head>average</head> in the structured classroom . The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools . According_to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit .</context>
