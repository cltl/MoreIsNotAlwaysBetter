      <context> Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty_acids , so necessary for maintaining the good_health of the circulatory_system . Aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamins and C - about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin_E requirement . The B_vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin . Calcium , <head>phosphorus</head> and iron are present in worthwhile amounts , and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts . None of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage .

The study comprised 16 male patients , ranging in age from 27 to 72 .</context>
