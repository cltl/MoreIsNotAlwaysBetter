      <context> Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in_order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village . At_the_same_time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out_of mere curiosity . No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived . When he had given the call a_few moments thought , he went_into the kitchen to ask Mrs._Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English <head>china</head> and the silver tea_service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds . Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn . Rector asked him to move it for_the_time_being ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless . A good initial impression would be important now .</context>

Hastening to the attic , the temperature of_which was easily hotter than the Gold_Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the_like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there .</context>
