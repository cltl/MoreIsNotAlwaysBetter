      <context> The Fulton_County_Grand_Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary_election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took_place . The jury further said in term end presentments that the City_Executive_Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City_of_Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . The September <head>October</head> term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior_Court_Judge_Durwood_Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate_Ivan_Allen_Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of_this city '' . The jury said it did find that many_of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' .</context>

      <context> Khrushchev threatens us with a 100 - megaton_bomb ? So_be_it - then we must embark_on a crash program for 200 - megaton_bombs of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron_bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing . So escalation proceeds , ad_infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead_of on their respective proving_grounds . What is needed , Philip_Morrison writes in The_Cornell_Daily_Sun ( <head>October</head> 26 ) is a discontinuity . The escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon . `` Only a discontinuity can end it '' , Professor_Morrison writes . `` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' .</context>

      <context> Some Catholic priests lecture there ; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students . Further evidence that Roman_Catholicism enjoys a more favorable_position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to_it in the mass_media of England . The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester_Guardian and the Sunday_Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic_Church is now at_least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches . On successive Sundays during <head>October</head> , 1960 , Paul_Ferris ( a non-Catholic ) wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen of the Church_of_England , the Church_of_Rome and the Nonconformist_Church . The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came_out the best . There were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very_much to do as clergyman . Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public_press of mid Victorian England .</context>

      <context> Thomas_Douglas , fifth Earl of Selkirk , a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red_River of the North . Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , he purchased great blocks of the Company's stock with the view to controlling its policies . Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116000 square_miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . The grant , which stretched southward to Lake_Traverse - the headwaters of the Red - was made in May , 1811 , and by <head>October</head> of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York_Factory on Hudson_Bay . Thus at the same time that William_Henry_Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana_Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North_American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier . Seven hundred miles south of York_Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 . By October the little colony about Fort_Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 .</context>

      <context> Alexander_McDonnell , governor of Red_River , and James_Bird , a chief factor of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , ordered such `` sundry articles '' to a value of 4500 . For its part the Hudson's_Bay_Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement . As the time drew_near for the drawing of the British American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the Pembina_colony - its own post and Fort_Daer - was on American territory . Accordingly Selkirk 's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by <head>October</head> , John_Halkett had torn_down both posts , floating the timber to `` the Forks '' in rafts . `` I have done everything '' , he wrote , `` to break_up the whole of that unfortunate establishment '' . Despite Company threats , duly carried_through , to cut_off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing_nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village . They would attempt to bring supplies from St._Louis or Prairie_du_Chien at `` great expense as well as danger '' .</context>

      <context> They would attempt to bring supplies from St._Louis or Prairie_du_Chien at `` great expense as well as danger '' . At Fort_Garry some of the_Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United_States , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort_Snelling . The disasters of 1825 - 1826 caused more to leave . After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on <head>October</head> 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick . In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June . On June 24 more than 400 families started the three month trip across the plains to the Mississippi . By fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort_Snelling , but most_of them were sent_on to Galena and St._Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United_States .</context>

Within a_few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called Meurons . The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great_Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War_of_1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go_to Red_River where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest_Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire .</context>

      <context> No previous antitrust_case , he said , had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief . The submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract . The Court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out . The Government submitted its proposed decree on <head>October</head> 25 , 1957 . The plan called_for divestiture by du_Pont of its 63000000 shares of General_Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders , as a dividend , over a period of ten years . Christiana_Securities_Company and Delaware_Realty_+_Investment_Company , major stockholders in du_Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten year period , of du_Pont 's General_Motors stock allocable to them , as_well_as any General_Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright . If , in the trustee 's judgment , `` reasonable market conditions '' did not prevail during any given year , he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten year period .</context>

      <context> Editor_Foss stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no_doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' . The Providence_Daily_Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings . The Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace . On <head>October</head> 31 , 1859 , John_Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder . For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in_public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 . Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia . Although Rhode_Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John_Brown 's trial with extreme interest .</context>
