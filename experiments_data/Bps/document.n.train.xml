      <context> Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances . The occasion for this marathon : Angel 's long awaited reissue in its `` Great_Recordings_of_the_Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro_Arte version . Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . Whether considered alone or in_relation_to other editions , COLH 40 is a <head>document</head> of prime importance . Artur_Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable . But Schnabel was a great teacher in_addition_to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford_Curzon , Frank_Glazer , Adrian_Aeschbacher , and Victor_Babin ) also sheds_light_on the master 's pedagogical skills . Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in_that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) .</context>

      <context> And he refused to be anything else . It is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy_Company and was trained on company ships . He was a Londoner , married , with three sons . ( The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first_name was Hendrik stem from Dutch <head>documents</head> of his third voyage . ) In 1610 , Hudson was probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession . Hudson 's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a_few miles down the Thames . There at the river 's edge waited one Henry_Greene , whom Hudson listed as a `` clerk '' .</context>
