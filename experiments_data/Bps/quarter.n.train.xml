      <context> Inspiring - yes ; instructive - maybe ; duplicable - no ! But for the technical fact , we have the artist 's own testimony : `` Of_late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors . First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in <head>quarter</head> scale ( approximately * * f inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values - the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark - by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns . If a human figure or wild_life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch . For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose . `` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .</context>

      <context> It depends_on the kind and the scale of the farming operation . General requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below . Specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 . Three <head>quarters</head> to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs . You could not , of_course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small . If you want_to raise feed or carry_out some enterprise on a larger scale , you 'll need more land . In deciding how much land you want , take_into_account the amount you 'll need to bring_in the income you expect .</context>

      <context> He walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns . Landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly '' but he was , in_fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath . He was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld , the roughneck king . O_'_Banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer , in the North_Side 's Little_Hell , close by the Sicilian <head>quarter</head> and Death_Corner . He had been a choir_boy at the Holy_Name_Cathedral and also served as an acolyte to Father_O_'_Brien . The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy_houses , honkytonks , and sawdust_saloons of his birthplace ; he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went_through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police dodging , and housebreaking . At the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the Loop , he was knocked_down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg .</context>

      <context> It was the 7_th_Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial_Palace_of_the_Emperor . But still Mel_Chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four syllable word , `` Garryowen '' . The final proof was a small incident . It happened at the St._Patrick 's_Day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone_into battle for over three <head>quarters</head> of a century to the strains of an Irish march . In_the_middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing_down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen . The faces belonged_to Lieutenant_Marvin_Goulding , his wife and their two children . And when the singing began , it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish songs the best .</context>

      <context> This is why I say we just can't go_ahead and disarm the Germans and pull_down our own defenses . Let me tell you what happened to me today .

I 've got a <head>quarter</head> of a_million Germans in my state , and those krautheads tune_in on Father_Werther every_night , and if he tells them to go_out and piss in the public_square , that 's what they do .

      <context> I know that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket_ball , as Isaac had been , yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself . I was drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from the road , and the fact that I was not afraid now , but only waiting to know what to do next . Meanwhile , I reloaded my gun , as the other men were doing . We were less than a <head>quarter</head> of a mile from the road , and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it . Wherever you looked , you saw Committeemen running across the meadows , some away from the road , some toward it , some parallel to it ; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at_least fifty militia were making their way in our direction . Cousin_Joshua and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington and take_up new positions ahead of the slow-moving British column , but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road . I did n't offer any advice , but I certainly did not want to go_back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out .</context>

A <head>quarter</head> inch this way or that for the hardbake , or the toffee , or the barley sugar , or the sardines , or the bitters , or the condensed_milk , or the stationery , or the needles - what could it mean ?

      <context> The doctor shot_down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory was occupied . Although a look of alarm passed_over his face , he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower_room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine . Alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat ; unwarranted they were in_any_case for , as he stood facing the fille_de_chambre , his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower_room . The events of the last <head>quarter</head> of an hour , mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard , had overcome the doctor 's hen and she gave_out a series of cackly wails , perhaps mourning her nest , but briefly enjoyed . The doctor 's wits had not left him , however , for all his sixty-eight years , and the wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing_out from the showerhead . Alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking_place and entered the doctor 's room . Shortly , the doctor himself entered , his hair somewhat wet from the shower , but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventures .</context>
