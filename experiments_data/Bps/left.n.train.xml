      <context> The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took_over in the top of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee_Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning appearance , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into <head>left</head> . Whitey_Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base_on_balls . Then three consecutive pinch_hitters failed to produce . Pete_Ward was sent in_for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short .</context>

      <context> The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday 's opener , and never lagged . Dick_McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don_Rudolph to open the Bear 's attack . After Al_Paschal grounded_out , Jay_Cooke walked and Jim_McDaniel singled home McAuliffe . Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line_drive to <head>left</head> . Jay_Porter drew a base_on_balls to fill the bases but Don_Wert 's smash was knocked_down by Rudolph for the putout . The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil_Shartzer 's glove . Nischwitz was working_on a 3_hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth .</context>

      <context> In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special_effects . Some clue to the character of London 's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion '' or `` percussive '' . Drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive_instruments are reproduced remarkably well . Only_too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined_up on one wall to your <head>left</head> and others facing them on the wall to your right . They are definitely in the same room with you , but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis_court watching a spirited volley . The Percussive Twenties ( SP 44006 ) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day , and Johnny_Keating 's Kombo gives_forth with tingling jazz in Percussive_Moods ( SP 44005 ) . Big_Band_Percussion ( SP 44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs - the arrangements just did n't have so much character as the others .</context>

      <context> For we have said , in_effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative . If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' is clearly untenable . Whereas Bultmann 's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl_Barth , involves the rejection or at_least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered . It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` <head>left</head> '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . To do this , it is sufficient to point_out that if the principle in_terms_of which alternatives are to be conceived is such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question .</context>

      <context> One day Maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in_advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified . Rudyard_Kipling 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ? The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something_About_Myself . One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster_Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his <head>left</head> , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more_than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation_Of_Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' .</context>

      <context> Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing_desk or table . Most_of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp , on stumps , pieces of bark , drum_heads , or the knee . In the South , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor . Scarcity of paper caused many Southerners to adopt the practice of cross writing , i._e. , after writing from <head>left</head> to right of the page in the usual manner , they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written . Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads . A Yank writing from Vicksburg , May 28 , 1863 , stated `` Not less_than 50 balls have passed_over me since I commenced writing . I could tell you of plenty narrow_escapes , but we take no notice of them now '' .</context>

      <context> The first thing he knew the words `` Garryowen '' ! burst from his throat . His followers shouted the old battle_cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran . The Koreans fell_back , but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire . Chandler , looking_to right and <head>left</head> to see how his men were faring , suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill , hurling grenades and hollering the battle_cry as he ran . It was Bob_Carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen . He had formed his own task_force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting_Seventh charge . Because of this diversionary_attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again .</context>

      <context> Although the standard_deviation values on which spread of the lines are based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . Third , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . It is convenient to classify a child 's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according_to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the <head>left</head> of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line . When a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classified according_to the position of the dot with_respect_to the vertical marking denoting the mean age . Such classifications may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , reserving `` moderate '' for dots upon or close to the mean . In the lower portion of each Chart , the Skeletal Age ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified .</context>

      <context> His files , desk , drafting_board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos . Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , ten foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as_though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac . Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden_Cycly_Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller_skates which he occasionally used up_and_down front of his house . He worked standing , with his <head>left</head> hand in his pocket as_though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person 's hand . Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved . It all seemed - if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows - as_though this broken nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler 's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss 's work . This air of disengagement carried_over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine .</context>
