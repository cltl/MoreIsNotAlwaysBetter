      <context> The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated . Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and_then older and_then still older , in_short , whether Adam 's life was intended to be part of the process of time . If it was , then it must have been God 's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity . One <head>night</head> , so some of these theories run , Adam would have fallen_asleep , much_as he fell_asleep for the creation of Eve ; and thus he would have been carried_over into the life_eternal . The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural_order of time and change . On_the_other_hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence . It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law .</context>

      <context> Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative . Unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated . Generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife 's mercy . `` The pattern '' , says Dr._Morton_Schillinger , psychologist at New_York 's Lincoln_Institute_for_Psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the <head>night</head> '' . No one seriously contends , of_course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world . After_all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as Dr._Schillinger points_out .
