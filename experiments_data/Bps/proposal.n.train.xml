      <context> An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State_Affairs_Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . Rep._Wesley_Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West_Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman_Bill_Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . The <head>proposal</head> would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said .

      <context> All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep._Bill_Jones , who was absent . Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas ' big cities Thursday . Rep._James_Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water_development bill passed by the Texas House_of_Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort_Worth to cover_up places like Paradise , a Wise_County hamlet of 250 people . When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar <head>proposal</head> is being sponsored by Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas . Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen._Parkhouse . The bill would increase from $ 5000000 to $ 15000000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water_project . Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas .</context>

      <context> `` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' . Morrison points_out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet_Union or Red_China , it is the most vulnerable of the great_powers - Europe of_course must be written_off out_of_hand . He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United_States is the least risky path our government can take . His <head>proposal</head> is opposed to that of Richard_Nixon , Governor_Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic_Energy_Commission , Dr._Edward_Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold_war . These gentlemen are calling_for a resumption of testing - in the atmosphere - on the greatest possible scale , all in_the_name_of national security . Escalation is their first love and their last ; they will be faithful unto death .

      <context> The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of_this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . In regard_to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of_this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light_mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any <head>proposal</head> , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on_trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as_well_as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ?</context>

      <context> Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship . Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so . If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic_system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? These <head>proposals</head> would go_far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual , who , in_turn , would help us to cope_with runaway technology . Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition . The battle is not easy .

      <context> Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each_day has increased tremendously since World_War_2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957 . Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New_York_City area . Here the New_York_Central_Railroad , one of the Nation 's most important carriers , has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949 . At this time of crisis in our Nation 's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New_York_Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake_+_Ohio_Railroad 's <head>proposal</head> for control of the Baltimore_+_Ohio_railroads . The New_York_Central has pointed_out that this control , if approved by the Interstate_Commerce_Commission , would give the combined C.+O. - B.+O._Railroad a total of 185 points served in_common with the New_York_Central . Not_only is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New_York_Central and other railroads serving the area . The New_York_Central notes : `` The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. +_O._-_B. +_O. provides the backbone of Central 's revenues .</context>

      <context> At the outset , the Government 's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government and for du_Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court . Du_Pont , he said , had proposed disenfranchisement of its General_Motors stock along with other restrictions on the du_Pont-General_Motors relationship . The Government , deeming these suggestions inadequate , had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du_Pont 's shares of General_Motors . Counsel for the Government invited du_Pont 's views on this <head>proposal</head> before recommending a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if counsel for du_Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable , the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days . Counsel for du_Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by both sides at an early date . No previous antitrust_case , he said , had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief . The submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract .</context>

      <context> Christiana and Delaware would , in_turn , be required to pass_on the voting_rights to the General_Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders . Du_Pont would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General_Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of du_Pont could serve as a director of General_Motors without court approval . Du_Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General_Motors stock except through General_Motors ' distributions of stock or subscription_rights to its stockholders . On June 6 , 1958 , General_Motors submitted its objections to the Government 's <head>proposal</head> . It argued , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both General_Motors and du_Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; that the tremendous volume of General_Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General_Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity . General_Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as_required by the mandate of_this Court . The decrees proposed by the amici_curiae were filed in August of 1958 .</context>

      <context> I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces . This means practically everybody in this room . Whether it will strike_home for you or not will be for you to determine . The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a colleague , a question from the Secretary or the President , a <head>proposal</head> by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the agenda of the United_Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies , a news_item read at the breakfast_table , a question to the President or the Secretary at a news_conference , a speech by a Senator or Congressman , an article in a periodical , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad , et_cetera , ad_infinitum . The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility . His first thought is about the question itself : Is there a question here for American foreign_policy , and , if so , what is it ?</context>

      <context> If we sit here reading editorials and looking at public_opinion_polls and other reports that cross our desks , we should realize that this is raw , undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership . What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership . We cannot test public_opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action . I doubt , for_example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk_about what came to be the Marshall_plan , any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such <head>proposals</head> . The problem in the policy officer 's mind thus begins to take_shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors - political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative - to be sorted_out and handled within a political_system which moves by consent in_relation_to an external environment which cannot be under_control . And the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping_at_his_heels .</context>

      <context> However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment . Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . This probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the <head>proposals</head> of unemployment_compensation or a Youth_Conservation_Corps . A maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from home . A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor . Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training .</context>
