      <context> I will reserve discussion of_it for a moment , however , to return to President_Kennedy . As symptomatic_of the common_man 's malaise , he is most significant : a liberal and a Catholic , elected by the skin_of_his_teeth . Does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , state of the public mind ? What is the common_man 's <head>complaint</head> ? Let 's take a panoramic look back over the course we have come . Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under Eisenhower ? And the basic character of_that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic .</context>

      <context> In september , 1958 , the patient developed generalized weakness and fatigue which was concurrent with exacerbation of his anemia ; the hemoglobin was 10.6 gm. . In an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulating the bone_marrow and controlling any hemolytic component , triamcinolone , 16 mg. daily , was begun on Sept. 26 , 1958 , and continued until Feb. 18 , 1959 . At_first the patient felt stronger , and the hemoglobin rose to 13.8 gm. , but on Oct. 20 , 1958 , he complained of `` caving_in '' in his knees . By Nov. 8 , 1958 , weakness , specifically involving the pelvic and thigh musculature , was pronounced , and a common <head>complaint</head> was `` difficulty in stepping up on to curbs '' . Prednisone , 30 mg. daily , was substituted for triamcinolone from Nov. 22 until Dec. 1 , 1958 , without any improvement in the weakness . Serum potassium at this time was 3.8 mEq. per liter , and the hemoglobin was 13.9 gm. By Dec. 1 , 1958 , the weakness in the pelvic and quadriceps muscle groups was appreciably worse , and it became difficult for the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining position . Triamcinolone , 16 mg. daily , was resumed and maintained until Feb. 18 , 1959 .</context>

      <context> These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism . Severe back pain in June , 1959 , prompted a third hospital admission . Extensive osteoporosis with partial collapse of D8 was found . A high protein diet , calcium_lactate supplements , and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal <head>complaint</head> or the severe muscle weakness . The terminal hospital admission on June 27 , 1959 , was necessitated by continued weakness and debility complicated by urinary retention and painful thrombosed hemorrhoids . X-ray_films of the vertebral_column showed progression of the demineralization . On July 4 , 1959 , the patient developed marked abdominal pain and distension , went into shock , and died .</context>
