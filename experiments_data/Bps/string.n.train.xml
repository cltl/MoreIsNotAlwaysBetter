      <context> Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick - several every Saturday , in_fact - out of football . Moritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip_pads but he 's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the cotton_bowl . That 's because he already has kicked 14 extra_points in 15 tries . He ran his <head>string</head> of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41 - 8 slaughter of Washington_State . Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . But ask coach Darrell_Royal what position he plays and you 'll get the quick response , `` place_kicker '' . A 208 - pound , 6 - foot 1 - inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking .</context>

      <context> Arnold sent_for Joe_Dey , the executive_secretary of the golf association . Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . `` I knew it all_along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . For a serious young_man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense_of_humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo <head>strings</head> . Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . He 'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he 's right . That 's how he first won the Masters in 1958 .</context>

      <context> The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives . About the Pro_Arte 's contribution I am less happy . I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group . From a technical standpoint , the <head>string</head> playing is good , but the Pro_Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here . The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy . The twenty-five year old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet . There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is_due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs .</context>

Turning_to the more modern versions , Curzon 's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work . Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought_out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout .</context>

      <context> It is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort . But having lived with the disc for some time now , I find the performance less exciting than either Schnabel 's or Fleisher 's ( whose superb performance with the Budapest_Quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good_deal less filled with humor than Curzon 's . Aeschbacher 's work is very_much akin to Schnabel 's , but the sound on his Decca disc is dated , and you will have a hard_time locating a copy of it . The Hephzibah_Menuhin-Amadeus_Quartet ( Angel ) and Victor_Babin-Festival_Quartet ( RCA_Victor ) editions give us superlative <head>string</head> playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing . ( Babin has acquired some of Schnabel 's keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight . ) Badura-Skoda-Vienna_Konzerthaus ( Westminster ) and Demus-Schubert_Quartet ( Deutsche_Grammophon ) are both warm_toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless . Helmut_Roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth_Ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last_mentioned pianists .</context>

      <context> But even before that , Picasso had glimpsed and entered , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him . It was as though , in_that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all_the_way back - or forward - to literal three-dimensionality . This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in_general ) literally into the literal space in_front of the picture_plane . Some time in 1912 , Picasso cut_out and folded a piece_of_paper in the shape of a guitar ; to this he glued and fitted other pieces_of_paper and four taut <head>strings</head> , thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture_plane . The affixed elements of collage were extruded , as_it_were , and cut_off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief .</context>

There she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote_off the letters , one to Abel , one to Mark . Once her trembling hand , with the pen grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper the words came sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips . And the stiffly regal look of them , she saw grimly , lacked the quaver of age which , thwarting the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken_words like a thin ragged <head>string</head> . `` Please come_down as_soon_as you conveniently can '' , the upright letters stalked from the broad nibbed pen , `` I have an important matter to discuss with you '' .
