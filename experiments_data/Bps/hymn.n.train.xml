      <context> They hope , of_course , to reclaim the non-Catholic population to the Catholic faith , and at every Sunday Benediction they recite by_heart the `` Prayer_for_England '' : `` O Blessed Virgin_Mary , Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon England , thy '' dowry `` , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee . Intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief Shepherd , the vicar of thy Son '' . A <head>hymn</head> often to be heard in Catholic churches is `` Faith_of_our_Fathers '' , which glories in England 's ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims : `` Faith of our Fathers : Mary 's prayers / Shall win our country back to thee '' . The English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty_Martyrs and Cardinal_Newman will soon be canonized . Because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , English Catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being `` English '' .</context>

      <context> From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden . This is brought_out in the next_to_last chapter of the book , `` A_Hero 's Funeral '' , written in the form of an impassioned prose_poem . Slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes_through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories . The guns are fired , the <head>hymns</head> are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors . As he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga . Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory . Excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of The_Charles_Men , and need not detain us here .</context>
