      <context> The rangy , Albany ( Cal. ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as_well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding '' as his 1961 goal . `` I think I can do a better job with the glove , now that I know the hitters around the league a_little better '' , he said . Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami_Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two game weekend series with the New_York Yankees . Skinny_Brown and Hoyt_Wilhelm , the Flock 's veteran knuckleball <head>specialists</head> , are slated to oppose the American_League champions in tomorrow 's 8 P.M. contest . Ryne_Duren and Roland_Sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15 - 1 record last year for the Yanks ' Auburn ( N.Y. ) farm_club of the Class - D New_York-Pennsylvania_League , are the probable rival pitchers . Twenty-one year old Milt_Pappas and Jerry_Walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers ' Art_Ditmar in Sunday 's 2 P.M. encounter . Ralph_Houk , successor to Casey_Stengel at the Yankee helm , plans to bring the entire New_York squad here from St._Petersburg , including Joe_Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games .</context>

      <context> Strange , but true - authenticity and realism often are n't related at_all . Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic - in_fact , impeccably so . In any given period_piece the costumes , bric-a-brac , vehicles , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity . The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research <head>specialists</head> who look to this matter . During the making recently of an important Biblical film , some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not_only of costumes and interiors , but of architectural developments , sports_arenas , vehicles , and other paraphernalia were compiled , consulted , and complied with . But , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set 's edge . The drama itself - and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama - often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at_all .</context>

      <context> That 's when he went_to Professor_Claude . And at_once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it . In his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked_out '' equipment since Vic_Tanny . Mr._Claude is a <head>specialist</head> in torso development and he has long favored the now famous Weider_Push-Pull_Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . So right_away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull_Super-Set consisting_of the wide grip Straight-Arm_Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull_Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib_cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar Bench_Press which specifically works_on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids . As you can see , in this Push-Pull_Super_Set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises , so the complete torso remains pumped-up all_the_time ! Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 1 , the professor allows him about a five minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 2 .</context>

      <context> Nature 's aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation . That done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant . Here is a word_of_advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds . Go_to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy <head>specialist</head> . It is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things ; in_fact it is easier . But you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow . Many people think that pansies last only a_few weeks , then their period of growth and bloom is over .</context>

      <context> Furthermore , the network in Figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the_like are interlaced . Not discussed here are some military problems of modern_times such_as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision_making are not the bottlenecks . Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain_forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach . This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient <head>specialists</head> of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for_example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry . We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes . This problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis . Since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it .</context>

      <context> But hear Harrison_E._Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The_New_York_Times , and author of `` To_Moscow_-_And_Beyond '' . In a book review of `` The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State_Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West_Contacts_Staff in_order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy_and_Bess ' overrode the State_Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz_musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo_montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry_Ford , Hugh_Cooper , Thomas_Campbell , the International_Harvester_Co. , and David_W._Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental <head>specialist</head> to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' . Perhaps the public 's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no_more exists in America . In his stead is a milquetoast version known_as `` the corporation '' .</context>
