      <context> The voices of all the characters , including that of Cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities . And the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed . Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here . Splendid , too , is the performance of Yuri_Tolubeyev , one of <head>Russia</head> 's leading comedians , as Sancho_Panza , the fat , grotesque `` squire '' . Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness - a sort_of peasant dignity - too . It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons . The episode in which Sancho_Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island '' is one of the best in the film .</context>

      <context> Well , Allied_Arts has booked Lena_Horne there for a week starting Dec. 4 . Queried about the impasse , Allied_Arts said : `` Better cancel the Kirov for_the_time_being . It 's all up_in_the_air again '' . So the Kirov will fly back to <head>Russia</head> , minus a Chicago engagement , a serious loss for dance fans - and for the frustrated bookers , cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country . Will somebody please reopen the Auditorium ? Paintings and drawings by Marie_Moore of St._Thomas , Virgin_Islands , are shown thru Nov. 5 at the Meadows_gallery , 3211 Ellis_Ave. , week_days , 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. , Sundays 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. , closed Mondays . An exhibition of Evelyn_Cibula 's paintings will open with a reception Nov. 5 at the Evanston_Community_center , 828 Davis_st. .</context>

      <context> First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both . Oddly_enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty . Certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better . <head>Russia</head> knows this , and that is why there were over 800000 competing for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team . Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try_for the team itself . We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people . And what has dancing to do with all this ?</context>

      <context> We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people . And what has dancing to do with all this ? A great_deal . <head>Russia</head> 's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus . Well stretched , trained in posture and coordinated movement , and wedded to rhythm , they presented the audiences in Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic contest . American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons . They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace .</context>

      <context> This is the story of his last tragic voyage , as_nearly_as we are able - or ever , probably , will be able - to determine : The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson 's fourth in four years . Each time his objective had been the same - a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far_East . In 1607 and 1608 , the English Muscovy_Company had sent him northward to look_for a route over the North_Pole or across the top of <head>Russia</head> . Twice he had failed , and the Muscovy_Company indicated it would not back him again . In 1609 , the Dutch_East_India_Company hired Hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the Half_Moon , and supplied him with Dutch sailors . This time he turned westward , to the middle_Atlantic coast of North_America .</context>

      <context> His ideal was Alexander_of_Macedon , as Napoleon 's was Julius_Caesar . His purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice . Each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god . Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of <head>Russia</head> and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him . Each is still glorified as a national hero . The first half of The_Charles_Men , ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second . After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .</context>

      <context> But hear Harrison_E._Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The_New_York_Times , and author of `` To_Moscow_-_And_Beyond '' . In a book review of `` The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State_Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West_Contacts_Staff in_order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy_and_Bess ' overrode the State_Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz_musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo_montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry_Ford , Hugh_Cooper , Thomas_Campbell , the International_Harvester_Co. , and David_W._Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated <head>Russia</head> as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' . Perhaps the public 's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no_more exists in America . In his stead is a milquetoast version known_as `` the corporation '' .</context>

      <context> During the last years of Woodrow_Wilson 's administration , a red_scare developed in our country . Many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of <head>Russia</head> and turned_to the repression of ideas by force . Postmaster_General Burleson set_about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails . Attorney_General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more_than 4000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights . Then , not many years later , the Un-American_Activities_Committee , under the leadership of Martin_Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens .</context>

      <context> Plenty , say the experts . In a broad sense , it would reaffirm the Monroe_Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western_Hemisphere . It could , by avoiding direct intervention , provide a short-of war strategy to meet short-of war infiltration . Primary target would be shipments of tanks , guns , aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from <head>Russia</head> and Czechoslovakia . Shipments of arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as contraband . In a total blockade , action could also be taken against ships bringing_in chemicals , oils , textiles , and even foodstuffs . At_times , three ships a day from the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports .</context>

      <context> He was marching up_and_down the locker_room of the Grassy_Brae_Golf_Club shouting , `` Bomb Cuba ! Bomb Berlin ! Let 's throw a_little nuclear hardware at them and show them who 's boss '' . He was brigadier of the club 's locker-room light infantry , and at one time or another declared war on <head>Russia</head> , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , and China . It all began on an autumn afternoon - and who , after all these centuries , can describe the fineness of an autumn day ? One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it . The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year 's lights .</context>
