      <context> R._H._S._Crossman , M.P. , writing in The_Manchester_Guardian , states that departures from West_Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a week . The official statistics show that 60 per_cent are employed workers or independent professional people . Whole families are moving and removal_firms are booked for months ahead . The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each_week from West_Germany , but the hard truth , says Crossman , is that `` The closing_off of East_Berlin without interference from the West and with the <head>use</head> only of East_German , as distinct from Russian , troops was a major Communist victory , which dealt West_Berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow .

Mark_Arnold-Foster writes : `` People are leaving [ West_Berlin ] because they think it is dying .</context>

Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light_mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent .

      <context> The grounds for the Church 's position are Scriptural ( Old_Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural_law . The latter plays a prominent role in Roman_Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods . The Roman_Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end . This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the <head>use</head> of his reason can ascertain God 's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements . Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race . Moreover , man may_not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by God , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception . Believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws_of_nature , Roman_Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them .</context>

      <context> This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons_systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_systems which have been overtaken by events . Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated . For_example , the importance of the Regulus_2 , , a very promising aerodynamic ship to surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic_missile launched by submerged submarines . Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long range interceptor with a speed three_times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for <head>use</head> against manned bombers in the period of the mid 1960 's . The substantial progress being made in ballistic_missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles .

      <context> The concept of apparent black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets .

We may say that his attitude was foolish , since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills ; or we may say that his attitude was commendable , showing his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others . In_any_case , he refused to accept the implications of the analysis , that he needed to be made_over . Another case may be given in illustration of a successful <head>use</head> of analysis , and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis . In a course for supermarket operators , a district_manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly successful as a store manager , found that in supervising other managers he was having a difficult time . On playing some typical situations before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated as unsatisfactory . He was told he displayed , for_example , a sense of superiority - and he answered : `` Well , I am supposed to know all the answers , are n't I '' ?</context>

      <context> When an evaluative situation is set_up , and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate , we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation . Observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion . This behavior is more `` veridical '' - or true than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning . While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major <head>uses</head> of this procedure . The objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts . In_addition , the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed . The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area .</context>

      <context> The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers . They were , in_a_sense , `` tried_out '' in realistic situations . From the point_of_view of the applicants , less time was wasted in being evaluated - and they got a meal out of it as_well_as some insights into their performances . Another <head>use</head> of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real_life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work . The position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions . All applicants were generally familiar_with the work of the receptionist . At the end of work one day , the personnel man took the applicants one_at_a_time , asked them to sit behind the receptionist 's desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes .</context>

      <context> Somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl , whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time , did the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist , showing wit , sparkle , and aplomb . She was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day . In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no_longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning . Some cases in_evidence of the <head>use</head> of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure . An engineer had been made the works manager of a firm , supplanting a retired employee who had been considered outstandingly successful . The engineer had more_than seven years of experience in the firm , was well trained , was considered a hard_worker , was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded_as a `` comer '' . However , he turned_out to be a complete failure in his new position .</context>

      <context> Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement . One finds , for_example , that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression , seeming at_first to be a mere hollow convention , reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings , and the most unconventional of meanings . More_than anything , it is the therapist 's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a spread-out deck_of_cards , on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient 's and his months of work together . one cannot assume , of_course , that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later_on when the stereotype was uttered ; probably it is correct to think_of it as a matter of a well grooved , stereotyped mode of expression - and no , or but a_few , other communicational grooves , as_yet - being there , available for the patient 's <head>use</head> , as newly emerging emotions and ideas well_up in him over the course of months . But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at_work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another . Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype - a `` How are you now '' ? or an `` I want to go_home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning .

      <context> I can n't be happy long without drinking water '' . In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent_to on Tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken_language ; but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a prepositional unit used as an adjunct , by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at_most . In the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking_water is equivalent_to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water . But the <head>use</head> of stress in comparison and contrast , for_example , can undermine distinctions such_as these . And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by_any_means . In the Steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them , and in I looked_up the number and I looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second . - Syllables are linguistic_units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but , as has been noted , are consonantal under certain circumstances , and which may or may not be combined with preceding and / or following consonants or combinations of consonants .</context>

      <context> the personal_pronoun has dominant stress because `` he '' has not been mentioned previously . If both George and a piece of information George does not have are prominent in the context , but the idea of telling George is new , then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell George ? But when what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious , there is normally only light stress or no stress at_all . Thus the unstressed it of it rarely snows here gets its significance from its <head>use</head> with snows : nothing can snow snow but `` it '' . In there are n't many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young takes dominant stress away from its head people : the fact that the young creatures of interest are people seems rather obvious . If women replaced people , it would normally have dominant stress . In I have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress than do .</context>

      <context> Actual practice does not often work_out this way . Tone_systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal_systems . Welmers has suggested one explanation . Tone_languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic <head>use</head> . This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable . The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features . Of_course , something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology : consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and an individual component .</context>

      <context> Other classes are included only by myself ( interrogatives , adverbs ) or only by Swadesh and Hoijer ( pronouns , demonstratives ) . What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes : ( 1 ) body_parts and products , which with a proportionally nearly even representation ( 51 terms out of 253 , 25 out of 100 ) come_out with nearly even ratios ; 2.6 and 2.7 ; ( 2 ) Nature ( 29 terms against 17 ) , ratios 3.3 versus 4.1 ; ( 3 ) adjectives ( 16 , 15 terms ) , ratios 3.9 versus 4.7 ; ( 4 ) verbs ( 9 , 22 terms ) , ratios 4.0 versus 3.4 . It will be seen that where the scope is similar , the Athabascan ratios come_out somewhat higher ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4 : 5 ) except for verbs , where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower . This exception may be connected with Hoijer 's <head>use</head> of a much higher percentage of verbs : 22 % of his total list as against 3.5 % in mine .

      <context> The existence of a public_school vocational training_program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled . Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked_out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being .

Few states make effective <head>use</head> of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry . The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad_hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment_training_programs that my be quickly set_up in a community to aid a new industrial plant . The major weakness of vocational training_programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands . This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country .</context>

      <context> The authors insist , however , that these abnormalities in the sense_of_touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight . First_of_all , what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged ? ( 1 ) When an object was placed in the patient 's hand , he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it was made of wood , iron , cloth , rubber , and_so_on .

      <context> It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas . It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's , which would confirm the date he assigns it . But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the <head>use</head> of simulated textures as_well_as of typography ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 .

( It makes no real difference that Braque 's collage is on_paper and eked_out in charcoal , while Picasso 's is on canvas and eked_out in oil . ) By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done .</context>
