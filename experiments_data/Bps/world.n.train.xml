      <context> It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel_de_Cervantes ' `` Don_Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide_screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth_Street and Sixty-eighth_Street_Playhouses . More_than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho_Panza , in seventeenth century Spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . Nikolai_Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander_Nevsky and Ivan_the_Terrible , performs the lanky Don_Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . His addle-brained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no_doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a <head>world</head> of cynics , hypocrites and rogues . Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do . He treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect . Directed by Grigory_Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world .</context>

The concept of unity , in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force , in which good and evil are relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon - such a concept is still reserved to the physical_sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas . When we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man 's worthlessness - until redeemed - the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time_and_time_again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state '' . Apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think_of the devil as being actually real .</context>

      <context> There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people . Instead , the audience can sit_back at_ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no_longer believes_in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion . A teenage girl , Abigail_Williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the Reverend_Samuel_Parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings . For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon <head>world</head> is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air . As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community . Everyone in Salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept_up by it . It is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with Abigail and Parris , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it .</context>

      <context> Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus_Christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind - sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus - then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid . This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter . Modern man , as Dietrich_Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come_of_age '' ; and though this process by_no_means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in_fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it . In_any_event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at_all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the <head>world</head> in which God has seen_fit to place us . To say this , of_course , is to take_up a position on one side of a controversy going_on now for some two hundred years , or , at_any_rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought . We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at_least , Bultmann . It is to this same tradition that most_of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong .</context>

    <instance id="br-d02#w384_0" docsrc="br-d02">
      <context> But this statement is completely unconvincing . If Bultmann 's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant . Nor is it necessary to look_for such evidence in the great urban_centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated . On_the_contrary , even in the heart of `` the Bible_belt '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological_revolutions have long been under_way , together with the corresponding changes in man 's picture of himself and his <head>world</head> . In_fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann 's argument is disclosed . Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence . This is especially in_evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle_class .</context>

      <context> Your invitation to write_about Serge_Prokofieff to honor his 70_th Anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya_Muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because I admire the music of Prokofieff ; and with sober purpose , because the development of Prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics . The Serge_Prokofieff whom we knew in the United_States_of_America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur - and very capable as a professional musician . These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social economic haute monde which supported the concert <head>world</head> of the post World_War_1 , era . Prokofieff 's outlook as a composer pianist conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant . Prokofieff 's Classical_Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well trained musician still in his twenties . To the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; to the Neo Classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world .</context>

      <context> Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability . Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated . At this date , it seems probable that the name of Serge_Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History , as an effective Traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ; yet was never caught_up in it - never a slave to its academic dialectics . Certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western <head>World</head> - not his experimentations . So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them . Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances . His fellow countryman , Igor Stravinsky , certainly did not .</context>

Stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home . How differently Prokofieff 's life unfolded . Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing <head>world</head> without losing his particular force and direction . In the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose . With a large and circumspect 20_th Century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children 's fairy_tales - Slavic dances and love songs - into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the World at_large . Of_course , it must_not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him ; time and economic security ; symphony_orchestras , opera and ballet_companies ; choruses , chamber_music ensembles ; soloists ; recordings ; broadcastings ; television ; large and eager audiences .</context>

      <context> Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light_mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on_trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the <head>world</head> press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as_well_as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? The infamous Wansee_Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put_to_death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich_Minister_of_the_Interior , the State_Secretary in_charge of the Four_Year_Plan , the Reich_Minister_of_Justice , the Under_Secretary_of_Foreign_Affairs . The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government . Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final_Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living_space through violence , economic_strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation .</context>

      <context> In_other_words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted_on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder . This , in_fact , it turned_out to be . Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed_forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of_it , conscious accomplices of Hitler 's crimes ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually . What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the <head>world</head> against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man_of_affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No_doubt many_of the citizens of the Third_Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today .

But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann 's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it . Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states . Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the <head>world</head> against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ?

      <context> fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the nations . But though this characterization in_no_way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of_it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the <head>world</head> the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final_Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? Should not everyone have been awakened to_it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard_to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by_no_means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .</context>

One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost . This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like New_York , Chicago , and Philadelphia . What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self_enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non Jewish <head>world</head> .

They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not_only on the external <head>world</head> , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group . Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized . Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act .

The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials . When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .

      <context> The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or_else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery . The image of God has simply disappeared . All such imitations of negative quality have given_rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at_least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak_to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved . The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a <head>world</head> rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems . Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually_exclusive , that they belong together . Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being . And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written .</context>

How did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New_England as it did in other parts of the country ? Is n't it a_bit odd that the three states of Southern New_England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode_Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A_+_M_colleges ? Was it supposed , perchance , that A_+_M ( vocational_training , that_is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant_class which flooded that part of the New_England <head>world</head> in the post Civil_War period , the immigrants having been brought_in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make_up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ? Is it not ironical that Roger_Williams 's state , Rhode_Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? The state universities of Maine , New_Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; they had less immigration to contend with .

      <context> For over a_hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them . It 's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly . By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ? The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North , to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the <head>world</head> that '' ( as James 's Christopher_Newman said to his adversaries ) `` however bad I may be , you 're not quite the people to say it '' . In the pre Civil_War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory_worker of the North .

      <context> The young William_Faulkner in New_Orleans in the 1920 's impressed the novelist Hamilton_Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so . Besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in_addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years . It is more difficult with Faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge . His own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the South , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the <head>world</head> around him primarily from his own unassisted observation . His denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no_doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the South or have written_about the South . To believe otherwise would be unrealistic . But in looking_at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the South , it is important not to lose the broader perspective .</context>

      <context> His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers . Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic_romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in_particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry_James and James_Joyce among them . His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him . My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked_at his <head>world</head> as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by_no_means new with him , and most_of the problems he takes_up have had the attention of authors before him . A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region . The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at_least since John_Pendleton_Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank_Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature .</context>

She could not resist the opportunity `` of showing her superiority in argument over a man '' which she had remarked as one of the `` feminine follies '' of Sara_Sullam ; and in her forthright way , Henrietta , who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think_of men as the privileged '' and `` women as submissive and yielding '' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris_Jastrow took the slightest exception - he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair , as_well_as on the radical reforms of Dr._Wise of Hebrew_Union_College - until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given_up hope they would ever agree on anything . But that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard_Street . `` We 've got Father and Mother and each_other , '' said Beth on the first page of Louisa_Alcott 's Little_Women ; and , `` I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the <head>world</head> '' , burst_out Jo some five_hundred pages later in that popular story of the March family , which had first appeared when Henrietta was eight ; and the Szold family , as it developed , bore a striking resemblance to the Marches .

The very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts ; usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived_notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly . She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man . Women themselves have come to look_upon matters in the same light as the outside <head>world</head> , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld . She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done . One who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger . In any case but the last , such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual ; the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining .</context>

      <context> When these fields are surveyed together , important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact with the fine_arts and even , to some extent , with science . Here we may observe that at_least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian 's research . Let us quote once_more from R._G._Collingwood : `` History is properly concerned with the actions of human_beings . Regarded from the outside , an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical <head>world</head> ; regarded from the inside , it is the carrying_into_action of a certain thought . The historian 's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them . It is a characteristic of thoughts that , in re-thinking them we come , ipso_facto , to understand why they were thought '' . Such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition .</context>

      <context> Still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature . The actual moments of contact are vitally important . These moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative_literature must be frequently concerned . Perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the Western <head>world</head> has been that of the Old and New_Testament . Certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of Western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the Bible . This reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence . A contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , St._Augustine , John_Bunyan , and Thomas_Jefferson , all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great_deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression .</context>

      <context> Whenever artists , indeed , turned_to actual representations or molded three-dimensional_figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . To speak of this underlying view of the <head>world</head> is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . At_the_least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line .

Mike remained in trance ; there was much to grok , loose_ends to puzzle_over and fit into his growing - all that he had seen and heard and been at the Archangel_Foster_Tabernacle ( not just cusp when he and Digby had come face_to_face alone ) - why Bishop_Senator_Boone made him warily uneasy , how Miss_Dawn_Ardent tasted like a water_brother when she was not , the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping_up_and_down and wailing - Jubal 's conversations coming and going - Jubal 's words troubled him most ; he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling , struggling to bridge between languages , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in . The word `` church '' which turned_up over_and_over_again among Jubal 's words gave him knotty difficulty ; there was no Martian concept to match it - unless one took `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` God '' and `` congregation '' and many other words and equated them to the totality of the only <head>world</head> he had known during growing waiting &amp; &amp; &amp; then forced the concept back into English in_that phrase which had been rejected ( by each differently ) by Jubal , by Mahmoud , by Digby . `` Thou art God '' . He was closer to understanding it in English now , although it could never have the inevitability of the Martian concept it stood_for . In his mind he spoke simultaneously the English sentence and the Martian word and felt closer grokking .</context>
