      <context> Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle_classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion . This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches . It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle_classes . It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local <head>stabilities</head> . Whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to_which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people . Attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches ; this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle_classes . The keynotes of_this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem .</context>

      <context> Its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the English_professor with whom one attends the theatre . The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of English_professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor_cars , political candidates , or female beauty . Along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than I have seen . In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon_Asch shows the transcultural <head>stability</head> of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human_beings and events . But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap . I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth . I use this term to mean three things : a search for the human significance of an event or state_of_affairs , a tendency to look_at wholes rather_than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling .</context>

      <context> At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less_than 0.5 V ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load . The current was regulated by_means_of a variable_resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter . The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders . Because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast_resistor was required for <head>stability</head> of operation . A high_frequency starter was used to start the arc . The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind . The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as_far_as_possible and they should be such_that an accurate heat balance can be made .</context>

      <context> In tularemia produced by aerosol exposure , one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of `` rabbit_fever '' on a finger . An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious . Agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such_as those causing Q_fever , tularemia , brucellosis , glanders , coccidioidomycosis , etc. , belong in this category . An agent would likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence <head>stability</head> to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements . It is , obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property . In this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction . Moreover , it should not be so fastidious in its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable .</context>

      <context> Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing_through this stage can be escaped . The United_States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face . At_the_same_time , we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and <head>stability</head> which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts . It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing_up to the intractable tasks at_home . We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene . When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold_war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not_only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development .</context>

      <context> Abel sat and regarded the farm country which , spreading_out from both sides of the road , rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields . He saw the land with a stranger 's eyes , all the old familiarness gone . And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself . There was <head>stability</head> there , too - a color which his life had had once . That is what childhood is , he told himself . Solid , settled , lost . In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone_poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt_Jessica 's letter .</context>
