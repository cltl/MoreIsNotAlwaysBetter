      <context> If the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied . Check the quality of the water .

Other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , <head>wave</head> action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value . Other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand_dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed . Just_as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek_out these features which are distinctive of their area . Although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site .</context>

The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in_charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university .

The following year he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr '' , traveling in Germany , France , and the_Netherlands , meeting the philosophers Schelling , Fichte , and Tieck .</context>

      <context> But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather_than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location . Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness . Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists_of minute <head>waves</head> of energy . We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound_waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite . So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states_of_matter , successive one_after_another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies . This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .</context>

      <context> During a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night . The luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca_miliaris by the turbulence of the sea . Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs ; the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance . The <head>waves</head> of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami_Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3000 feet . Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands . The tsunami warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander_C._K._Green of the Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey staff . It consists_of a series of pipes and a pressure measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface .</context>

      <context> The moment the alarm goes_off , information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu , which is the center of the warning system . This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast_Survey stations in the Pacific which are equipped with seismographs . Its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami . By means of charts showing <head>wave</head> travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time_of_arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under_way at any spot in the Pacific . The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps . All_of these activities are geared to a top priority communication_system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly . Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence .</context>

      <context> A tsunami may be started by a sea_bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic_eruption . The most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883 ; it raced across the Pacific at 300 miles an hour , devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high , and pounded the shore as far_away as San_Francisco . The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge <head>waves</head> . Whether or not Plato 's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times . Indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian_Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood . One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1 , 1755 ; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far_away as the English coast .</context>

      <context> This is the rate of projection ; it is also the rate of photographing . Time is built into the motion_picture , which cannot exist without time . Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end - elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence . The `` moving '' picture of the train or the <head>wave</head> coming at the audience is , to_be_sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo . In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film . Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time . This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician 's tricks produced on film .</context>

      <context> This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 ) . Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 a , b , c ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 ) . In the relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave_lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 cm . The observable characteristics of planetary radio_radiation are the intensity , the polarization , and the direction of arrival of the <head>waves</head> . The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute_of_arc . This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction , and consequently the radio_emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved . It should be possible , however , to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio_sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers .</context>

      <context> one cannot assume , of_course , that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later_on when the stereotype was uttered ; probably it is correct to think_of it as a matter of a well grooved , stereotyped mode of expression - and no , or but a_few , other communicational grooves , as_yet - being there , available for the patient 's use , as newly emerging emotions and ideas well_up in him over the course of months . But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at_work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another . Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype - a `` How are you now '' ? or an `` I want to go_home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning . A hebephrenic man used_to give a repetitious <head>wave</head> of his hand a number of times during his largely silent hours with his therapist . When the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` What is that , Bill - hello or farewell '' ? , the patient replied , `` Both , Dearie - two in one '' .
