      <context> NBC had gathered a_lot of historical material which it was eager to share . For_example , there was sheet_music with the word `` jazz '' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took_hold . Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone_poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 's . However well_chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening 's main business , which ( considering the talent at_hand ) should probably have been the <head>gathering</head> of fresh samples of the Chicago style . Another source of NBC pride was its rare film_clip of Bix_Beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew_by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted_out the entire glimpse . Similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz_groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal . `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' may have wound_up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer .</context>

      <context> There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement . You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before . I can n't tell when , but I'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular <head>gathering</head> at some time in the past '' ! This experience will have happened to many of you . Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' . Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja_vu ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences .</context>

      <context> In_fact , O_'_Connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $ 2500 diamond stickpin . There was a brief interruption while one of O_'_Banion 's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip . Then O_'_Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds . This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more_or_less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious <head>gatherings</head> , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek_by_jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928_-_29 '' . However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever . O_'_Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal .</context>

      <context> But in our case - and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts - the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come_close to wrecking several more . In_fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down . Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up_against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view . But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee hatred displayed in social <head>gatherings</head> . From my wife 's experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles . The strong feeling is certainly there ; but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South , especially among those who studied in the North . And social_relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting Northerners .</context>

      <context> In many Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church_bells were tolled . Such was not the case in Rhode_Island . The only public demonstration in honor of John_Brown was held at Pratt_'s_Hall in Providence , on the day of his execution . Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt_Hall meeting `` brought_together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many_of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a <head>gathering</head> '' . Seated on the platform were Amos_C._Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; Thomas_Davis , an uncompromising Garrisonian ; the Reverend_Augustus_Woodbury , a Unitarian minister ; the Reverend_George_T._Day , a Free-Will Baptist ; Daniel_w._Vaughan , and William_H._H._Clements . The latter two were appointed secretaries . The first speaker was Amos_C._Barstow who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting .</context>

      <context> The fourth and last speaker was Thomas_Davis . By this time large_numbers of the audience had left the hall . Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city . He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a <head>gathering</head> was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments . In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took_part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned '' . He recalled that in Rhode_Island a party opposed to the state 's condemnation of a man ( Thomas_W._Dorr ) proclaimed the state 's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty . At the close of Davis ' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously :</context>

      <context> Long before he reached the protection of the stage_door , Andy was recognized . Word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brush-fire . They surged around him , fingers pointing , eyes prying . It was not a hostile <head>gathering</head> but Andy sensed the difference from last night 's hero-worshippers . They had come not to admire but to observe . `` It 's worse inside '' , Thornburg informed Andy . `` Skolman 's jammed in every table he could find .</context>
