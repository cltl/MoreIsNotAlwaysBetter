Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property_settlement has been agreed_upon . The petition listed the mayor 's occupation as `` attorney '' and his age as 71 .

      <context> What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self_enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non Jewish world . Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn_College - constituting 85 per_cent of those who attend the day session - can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower_middle_class Jewish student . There is , to begin , an important sex difference . Typically , in a lower-middle_class Jewish family , a son will be sent to an out-of-town school , if financial resources warrant it , while the <head>daughter</head> will attend the local college . There are two reasons for this . First , the girl 's education has a lower priority than the son 's . Second , the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son .</context>

      <context> If , as a home_movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event . If , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a_few frames of the child 's grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film ; you are employing the basic technique of film ; you are cutting . This is what Porter did . As the robbers leave the looted train , the film suddenly cuts_back to the station , where the telegrapher 's little <head>daughter</head> arrives with her father 's dinner_pail only to find him bound on the floor .

      <context> One can meet_with aloofness almost anywhere : the Thank-Heaven-We 're_-_not-Involved viewpoint , It Does n't Affect Us ! Southern Liberals ( there are a_good_many ) - especially if they 're rich - often exhibit blithe insouciance . The trouble here is that it 's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it does n't cost you anything . You 've already sent your <head>daughter</head> to Miss_X 's select academy for girls and your son to Mr._Y 's select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity . If there 's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there 's always New_England . New_England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as_well_as West . They may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns_out to be from Thailand , or any place other_than the American South .</context>

      <context> Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries . Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background . These are suggestive_of Selma_Lagerlo ^ f . Especially touching is the chapter , `` The_Little_Sister '' , about a king 's <head>daughter</head> who became a nun in the convent of St._Birgitta . The record teems with romance and adventure . Gustaf_Vasa is a superb example , and Charles_10 , , the conqueror of Denmark , hardly less so . Of Gustavus_Adolphus and Charles_12 , it is unnecessary to speak .</context>

      <context> She continues to add to the pollen supply as_needed . The larvae , kept warm by the queen , are full_grown in about ten days . Each now makes a tough , papery cocoon and pupates . After another two_weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small <head>daughters</head> that begin to play the role of worker_bees , collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen retires to a life of egg_laying . The first worker_bees do not mate or lay eggs ; males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season . The broods of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed . By the middle of the summer , many_of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is `` optimal '' , and it is then that young queens begin to appear .</context>
