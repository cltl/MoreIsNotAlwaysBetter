      <context> Spahn not_only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball_player 's ball_player , as they say in the trade . I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition_game at Bears_Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18792 . `` Spahnie does n't know how to merely go_through_the_motions '' , remarked Enos_Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse . The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the <head>big_leagues</head> come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home_runs in a span of nine innings .

Ed_Delahanty and Chuck_Klein of the Phillies , the Braves ' Joe_Adcock , Lou_Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat_Seerey of the White_Sox and Rocky_Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on_the_road .</context>

Shea 's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium . Shea and his wife , Nori , make their home at Sands_Point , L._I. . Bill_Jr. , 20 ; Kathy , 15 , and Patricia , 9 , round_out the Shea family .</context>

      <context> Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned . Suddenly his voice grew hard . `` What the hell do you think baseball is ? You 're not in the <head>big_leagues</head> , but if you can n't give_and_take down here what the hell do you think it 'll be like up there '' ? Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short . `` Now do n't tell me what a good ball_player you are . I know you 've got talent .</context>
