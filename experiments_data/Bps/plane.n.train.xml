      <context> In analyzing the watercolors of Roy_Mason , the first thing that comes_to_mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate . Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential <head>planes</head> : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; a middle_distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .</context>

Over the years , beginning in 1929 , Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals ; two Ranger_Fund_purchase_awards ; the Joseph_Pennell_Memorial_Medal ; two American_Watercolor_Society_prizes ; the Blair_Purchase_Prize for watercolor , Art_Institute of Chicago ; and_others in Buffalo , New_York , Chautauqua , New_Haven , Rochester , Rockport , and most_recently , the $ 300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna_Beach_Art_Association , He was elected to the National_Academy_of_Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger_Fund_Purchase_Prize at the Academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to Academicianship in 1940 .

      <context> Cuban S._S._R. : Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro held mainland last week , there was at_least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian dominated military base . In_fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment . Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought_home to all_of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home . Russian tanks and <head>planes</head> in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United_States , violate the Monroe_Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin_American republic . Once the full extent of_this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President_Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone . But the Latin_American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American_Defense_Board . For years the United_States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro 's representative from secret military talks .</context>

      <context> These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear . Just as the pressure exerted by surface_tension in a spherical drop is * * f and the pressure exerted by surface_tension on a cylindrical shape is * * f , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is * * f , where |g is the interfacial_tension and * * f and * * f are the two radii_of_curvature . This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason . If a is the major_axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes , the radius_of_curvature in the ab <head>plane</head> at the end of the axis is * * f , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axes is * * f . There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas . However , there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol_phthalate ( viscosity 155 poises ) suspended in corn_syrup of 71 poises in a paper by Mason and Bartok .

      <context> Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar corpuscular_radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . Further , the corpuscular_radiation , i.e. , the solar_wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive_force to the gravitational_force . The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi major_axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor_axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . Also , planetary gravitational_attraction increases the dust concentration near the <head>plane</head> of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . At one astronomical_unit from the sun ( the Earth 's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about * * f km of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic_energy less than their potential_energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . De_Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more_and_more eccentric without changing the semi major_axis .</context>

In_addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain .

Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component .

      <context> And the same thing , more_or_less , can be said of the contents of Picasso 's first collage . In later collages of both masters , a variety of extraneous materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in_conjunction_with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think_of . The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material - or simply of a painted in form - will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth . <head>Planes</head> defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially . All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so_as to encompass fictive space in_front of the surface as_well_as behind it . Flatness may now monopolize everything , but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn_into illusion itself - at_least an optical if_not , properly_speaking , a pictorial illusion . Depicted , Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal , undepicted kind , but at_the_same_time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind - and it does so , moreover , without depriving the latter of its literalness ; rather , it underpins and reinforces that literalness , re-creates it .</context>

Large planes juxtaposed with other large <head>planes</head> tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to_the_extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) . It was because of this chain-reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_objects , or at_least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there . Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities .</context>
