      <context> West_Berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable . Nearly 18 per_cent of West_Berlin 's 2200000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12.8 per_cent are under fifteen . R._H._S._Crossman , M.P. , writing in The_Manchester_Guardian , states that departures from West_Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a week . The official statistics show that 60 per_cent are employed <head>workers</head> or independent professional people . Whole families are moving and removal_firms are booked for months ahead . The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each_week from West_Germany , but the hard truth , says Crossman , is that `` The closing_off of East_Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East_German , as distinct from Russian , troops was a major Communist victory , which dealt West_Berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow . The gallant half city is dying on_its_feet '' .</context>

      <context> With detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a_few counts , the second and third Russian space_probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less_than that of larger ones .

Many <head>workers</head> believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities . However , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship .

The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor .</context>

There is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees .

The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity .
