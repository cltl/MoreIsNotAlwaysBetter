If this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation .

      <context> But if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously . Not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the Soviet sphere . Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent_on following compulsively in his footsteps . When one powerful <head>nation</head> strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural . Thus , when the Russians sent up their first sputnik , American chagrin was human enough , and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable . But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly . When East_Germans fled to the West by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists .</context>

The answer is , `` Yes '' ! Certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical_Symphony seriously , and with a good_deal of pleasure . His life-long friend , Serge_Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , New_York , and Washington , D._C. , to_which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole <head>nation</head> . Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world_premiere of the Love_for_Three_Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third_Piano_Concerto . `` Uncle_Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden_Twenties '' . We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano_sonatas , chamber_music , gavottes , and marches ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities .</context>

The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the <head>nations</head> .

      <context> That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant . As_long_as his material is Americana , can in_some_way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied . From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth century American folklore . On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought_out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make_up this <head>nation</head> . On the other we have the flag_wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways . After_all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates .</context>

      <context> Stephen_Vincent_Benet 's John_Brown's_Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John_Steinbeck 's The_Grapes_of_Wrath and Carl_Sandburg 's The_People,_Yes . The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass . Folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it . The folk are simply not homogeneous with_respect_to <head>nation</head> or political attitude . In_fact , there is much evidence to indicate they do n't care a_bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits . Nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for `` the_good_old_days '' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of Americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk .</context>

      <context> The thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it . The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United_States is weaker than the Soviet_Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead . This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human_beings typically do - namely , by taking steps to end_up on what appears to be the winning side . To the extent , then , that declining U._S. prestige means that other <head>nations</head> will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern . Still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet_Union and ourselves . Here I do not speak_of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power - of influence , if you will - about which the relevant questions are : Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ?</context>

      <context> Prosperity is a worthy objective ; but if providing higher standards_of_living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made . It may be , of_course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in_favor_of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of Soviet Communist power . This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used . This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a <head>nation</head> makes of power . I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be . And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free_world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . In the recent political_campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus .</context>

These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis .</context>

      <context> These societies can expect to face difficult times . As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense_of_direction . National_leaders will have_to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men 's sense of identity . Feelings of a community of interest will have_to be recreated - in some of the new <head>nations</head> , indeed , they must be built for_the_first_time - on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past . Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing_through this stage can be escaped . The United_States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face .</context>

      <context> It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing_up to the intractable tasks at_home . We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene . When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold_war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not_only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development . As a <head>nation</head> , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world community . When we look_at countries like Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , and Burma , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern_men and of social overhead capital , and where institutions of centralized government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy . The men in power are committed in_principle to modernization , but economic and social changes are proceeding only erratically . Isolated enterprises have been launched , but they are not_yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern .</context>

      <context> Federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local districts must pay at_least half . The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . Throughout the history of the program , state_government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures , while local districts all_together have spent more_than either Federal or state_governments . Today , Federal funds account_for only one-fifth of the <head>nation</head> 's expenditures for vocational education . The greatest impact of the matching fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds . National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades .

      <context> It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions . On_the_one_hand , the major European_nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience .

      <context> In the century from 1815 to 1914 the law_of_nations became international_law . Several factors contributed to this change . The Congress_of_Vienna is a convenient starting_point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . Here in 1815 the great <head>nations</head> assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political_system that was central to world politics for a century . International_law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European_nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international_law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political_system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; second , it had to be compatible with the value_system that they shared .</context>

      <context> The European customs on which international_law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states . Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed countries . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new <head>nations</head> of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system .</context>
