      <context> In carrying_out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit . The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support . Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time . When , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever <head>status</head> they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality . In doing so science has unquestionably cleared_up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions . There have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful . All this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing .</context>

      <context> Not_only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent_to certification to teach the subject . Participation for the educator in this case , however , would have_to be raised to full and complete membership . The largest of these organizations at_present denies to the full_time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog . This anomalous <head>status</head> of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students . The professor in_turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice . This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands . In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools .</context>

      <context> Only a_few years ago a middle_western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior_design . At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art '' . This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer . We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior_design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take_on the usual accompaniments of teaching - minimal income and minimal <head>status</head> among their confreres . Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such_as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable . In all `` degree '' courses in interior_design a number of `` academic '' or `` general studies '' courses are included . It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and_so_on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior_design , as are the art_teachers educated in the academic subjects .</context>

Practically all_of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high_school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at_once on the basis of the skill . They are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high_school . To_be_sure , in tool-and-die_work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of halftime vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice <head>status</head> . Similarly , a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at_once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community_college or secretarial_school . Of_course , it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill .

Staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented .

In all_of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgraded to the <head>status</head> of recording instrument for art_work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author . The phonograph today , for all its high_fidelity and stereophonic sound , is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera .

      <context> With few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central_city . The key to Protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation . Members of higher and lower social_status often cluster around this nucleus , so_that Protestant figures on social_class give the impression of spread over all social_classes ; but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum . The congregation perishes when it is no_longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have_to recruit constantly in their core stratum in_order to survive ; they can lose higher - and lower <head>status</head> members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in_order to preserve economic integration . The congregation is first_and_foremost an economic peer_group ; it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship . If it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the New Protestantism ( with a_few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do . They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers .</context>

How did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New_England as it did in other parts of the country ?

      <context> In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them - and that with independence free_men do not have_to work to realize the benefits of modern life . For_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement . The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and <head>status</head> rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies . We should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call_for effort as_well_as enthusiasm . Above_all , we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible_for their fates .</context>
