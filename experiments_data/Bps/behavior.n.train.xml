      <context> If we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing . Records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music . This difference is made_up of many factors .

( Music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat . ) From the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original . Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests .</context>

      <context> This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in_common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war . We , in our country , think_of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing . And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at_least uncertain way on the details of how we behave . What elements of our <head>behavior</head> are decisive ? Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? We have staved_off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of_it , since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective .

      <context> I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand_out quite clearly . They are in_general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual . They include both individual fears and collective ones . They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not_only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of <head>behavior</head> of the individual or group . Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized . Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act . To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .</context>

      <context> As in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images . Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense . A word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene '' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings . Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for <head>behavior</head> without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field . A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy . The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials . When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .</context>

      <context> With troops dispersed on fields_of_battle rather than on the parade_ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication . Years ago this was true , but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too_much is heard . In contrast to cocktail_parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal . In the extreme and oversimplified example suggested in Figure 3 , the organization is more easily understood and more predictable in <head>behavior</head> . A military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command . This objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action . The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting_as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village .</context>

      <context> Its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the English_professor with whom one attends the theatre . The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of English_professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor_cars , political candidates , or female beauty . Along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than I have seen . In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal <head>Behavior</head> the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon_Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human_beings and events . But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap . I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth . I use this term to mean three things : a search for the human significance of an event or state_of_affairs , a tendency to look_at wholes rather_than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling .</context>

      <context> `` History has this in_common with every other science : that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in_the_first_place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based .

Let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought - turning our attention from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades . We may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts .</context>

      <context> Success in observing these spectral lines has so_far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ; extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported . Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals . The Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 * * f . The efforts and accomplishments fall_into three main categories : absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the <head>behavior</head> of germanium resistors , and helium 4 vapor-pressure measurements ( see p. 144 ) . An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the thermometric fluid , to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 * * f . Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute_temperature measurement , and may be used as_an_alternative to the gas_thermometer . When values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium 4 vapor_pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found .</context>

      <context> They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side . This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock_therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl_test . Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl_test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm . Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical <head>behavior</head> of neuropsychiatric patients has not_yet been tested on an adequate number of patients . The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable . It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep wakefulness cycle . A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting .</context>

      <context> It has further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ( 2 ) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned_reactions ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned_stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned_reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing ( alerting ) effect on the EEG . These are few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned_reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes . The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion . If this is the case , one would expect that not_only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional_state and <head>behavior</head> but that emotion itself would act likewise . We pointed_out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic_disorders and neurotic symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( `` abreaction '' ) may cure a battle neurosis . This phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may_not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses . Being a strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself .</context>

The two ratings yield a correlation of + .04 , which is not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics . In_theory , compulsive <head>behavior</head> is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer . The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken_up later . In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress , and the children 's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years . In establishing criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself .</context>

A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used_to often seclude herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door - as I would find on passing_by , between our sessions - for_all_the_world like two persons , a scolding mother and a defensive child . Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome . I have found , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's <head>behavior</head> . For_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got_up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the end of each session . Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met .</context>

This second conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored . Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence , which weights not_only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative_frequency .</context>

      <context> If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per_cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per_cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller . And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones . It is evident that Swadesh has not_only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable <head>behavior</head> of lexical items . Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list ? It is the urge to obtain a list as free_of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible . And why that insistence ?</context>

      <context> When now we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these differences : * * f This distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart : * * f ; which , divided by * * f gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart . If the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families , the distance would of_course be 0 .

      <context> In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled_out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise . Thus , for non negative changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active wage_setter , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence . The presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case , on the grounds that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously . From this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be_due to union <head>behavior</head> different and more aggressive than assumed in our model . It is this conclusion that we challenge ; we do so by disproving the presumption on which it is based . It is convenient to assume that the union industry contract is of one year 's duration .</context>

      <context> Wage price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces - no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage price <head>behavior</head> of a_few very important industries . While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United_States since World_War_2 , . Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here presented . The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price_competition , but which is so basic that its wage price policies are held in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny .</context>
