      <context> We will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is not . In Plato 's Republic communism is - to speak anachronistically - a communism of Janissaries . Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership prevails , the governing warrior elite . Moreover , it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial impetus to Plato 's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods , wives , and children , was his quest for a <head>canon</head> for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche ; and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns . In More 's Utopia communism is not a means of separating_out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass . Utopian communism applies to all Utopians . And in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central .</context>

      <context> More believed that a man could be both serious and gay . That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all_too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of . Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . Indeed , it is even surprising in the <head>Canon</head> of Christ_Church and Regius_Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance_English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . But to return to the main line of our inquiry . It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr . Utopia is still widely read because in_a_sense More stood on the margin of modernity .</context>

      <context> We find it in Plato 's republic , and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book . We find it in that `` common way_of_life pleasing to Christ and still in_use among the truest societies of Christians '' , that_is , the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity . We find it in the later Stoic conception of man 's natural condition which included the community of all possessions . This conception was taken_up by the early Church_Fathers and by <head>canon</head> lawyers and theologians in the Middle_Ages ; and More was far too well_read not to have come_across it in one or several of the forms thus given it . But although the idea of communism is very old even in More 's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it is not communism as_such that we are concerned with . We are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus : Platonic , Stoic , early Christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism ; we are concerned with Utopian communism - that_is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia , as More conceived it .</context>

      <context> Let evildoers contemplate their ways , and let every man beware '' ! John 's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just received from his sister Mary . Charles had died two_weeks before , in early November , without being reconciled to the Church . The <head>canons</head> , in a body , had tried to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last_rites of the Church , but he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith . Burial had taken_place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet , so that his enemies could not find his body and have it dug_up and burned . The Abbot of St._Eloi , Claude_de_Mommor , had been a good friend , but not even he thought Charles deserved burial in hallowed ground . John closed his eyes and saw once_again the little niche in his mother 's bedroom , where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs .</context>

      <context> John closed his eyes and saw once_again the little niche in his mother 's bedroom , where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs . The blue draped Virgin was still there , but no_one knelt before her now . Not even Varnessa ; she , too , prayed only to God . For an instant John longed for the sound of the bells of Noyon-la-Sainte , the touch of his mother 's hand , the lilt of Charles 's voice in the square raftered rooms , his father 's bass tones rumbling to the <head>canons</head> , and the sight of the beloved bishop . But he had_to follow the light . Unless God expected a man to believe the Holy_Scriptures , why had He given them to him ? The white clad trees stood like specters in the February night .</context>
