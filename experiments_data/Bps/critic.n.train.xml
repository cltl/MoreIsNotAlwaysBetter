      <context> The `` chase '' as a standard film device probably dates_from The_Great_Train_Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device . The chase in itself is a narrative ; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting - both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not_only catering to what <head>critics</head> may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; these films and these sequences are also seeking_out - instinctively or by_design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative . There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . The man was D.W._Griffith . When he came to the movies - more_or_less by accident - they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes .</context>

      <context> But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths . For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in_contrast_to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality . The central concern of Erich_Auerbach 's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved . Following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels , the Christian artist and <head>critic</head> sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures '' of divine power and reality . Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent . Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama . The artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction .</context>

      <context> It may , however , be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris . The first result of Heidenstam 's long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems , Pilgrimage_and_Wander_Years ( Vallfart_och_vandringsar ) , published in 1888 . It was a brilliant debut , so_much_so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets , as did Byron 's Childe_Harold . Professor_Fredrik_Bo ^ o ^ k , Sweden 's foremost <head>critic</head> of the period , acclaims it as_follows : `` In this we have the verse of a painter ; strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid . In a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic ; all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively . The young poet painter reproduces the French life of the streets ; he tells stories of the Thousand_and_One_Nights , and conjures_up before us the bazaars of Damascus . In the care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he loves it .</context>

      <context> In_essence this involves grounding one 's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather_than in one 's own values and experience . There is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else . Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important . Moreover , if the <head>critic</head> instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo thinking ; if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity . The second timely part of_this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary_works and the ephemeral mass_culture products of today . In the range and variety of characters who , in their literary lives , get_along all_right with life_styles one never imagined possible , there is an implicit lesson in differentiation . The reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ? and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species .</context>

      <context> He will frequently return to it . The continuities , contrasts , and similarities discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other . When we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption . Most students of literature , whether they call themselves scholars or <head>critics</head> , are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary_works as_well_as to enjoy them . Many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding . This understanding , of_course , may in_its_turn take many forms and some of these - especially those most interesting to the student of comparative_literature - are essentially historical . But the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic questions of form , `` texture '' , or technique .</context>

      <context> During the next weeks he looked over the situation . First_of_all there was the parsonage , an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live_in , originally poorly conceived , apparently not repaired for years , with no plumbing or sewage , with rat-holes and rot . It was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church , a woman named Catt who , as Wilson afterward found , was briefly referred to as The_Cat because of her sharp_tongue and fierce initiative . Ann_Catt was a lonely , devoted soul , never married , conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church , but a perpetual dissenter and born <head>critic</head> . She soared over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository . Then Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition . The salary of the pastor had for years been $ 500 annually and even this was in_arrears .</context>

      <context> I called the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves_Moreland , the Anglo-American literary <head>critic</head> - his mother was_born in Ohio - who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson_Downs , raising_hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old_man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such_as human stature , hope , and humor . My unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in_terms_of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe_in the cult_of_personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . A bee 's place is in the hive '' .</context>
