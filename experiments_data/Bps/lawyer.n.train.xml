      <context> It permits the state to take_over bank_accounts , stocks and other personal_property of persons missing for seven years or more . The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance_firms , pipeline_companies and other corporations to report such property to the state_treasurer . The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . Dewey_Lawrence , a Tyler <head>lawyer</head> representing the Texas_Bankers_Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . `` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . `` You take out_of circulation many millions of dollars '' . Rep._Charles_E._Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would `` amount to making a gift out_of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline_companies '' .</context>

      <context> Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William_J._Slocum_Memorial_Award .

A crowd of 1400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song . The 53 - year old Shea , a prominent corporation <head>lawyer</head> with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible_for the imminent return of a National_League club to New_York . Named by Mayor_Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James_A._Farley , Bernard_Gimbel and Clint_Blume , Shea worked relentlessly . His goal was to obtain a National_League team for this city . The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New_York with only the Yankees .</context>

      <context> Finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing_up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with Cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann 's stories . We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates . For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody . Professionally a <head>lawyer</head> , that_is_to_say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed_up , disguised - that_is , paradoxically , revealed - as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child . That this abandonment takes_place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring_down upon him the punishment for art ; that_is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann 's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even_though the constant elements of the artist nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and La^utner . It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann 's early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic . In a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one_and_the_same .</context>

      <context> Johnny_Mercer practically grew_up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears . He was_born in savannah , Georgia , in 1909 . His father , George_A._Mercer , was descended from an honored Southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one Hugh_Mercer , who had emigrated from Scotland in 1747 . The lyricist 's father was a <head>lawyer</head> who had branched_out into real_estate . His second wife , Lillian , was the mother of John_H._Mercer .

      <context> We find it in Plato 's republic , and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book . We find it in that `` common way_of_life pleasing to Christ and still in_use among the truest societies of Christians '' , that_is , the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity . We find it in the later Stoic conception of man 's natural condition which included the community of all possessions . This conception was taken_up by the early Church_Fathers and by canon <head>lawyers</head> and theologians in the Middle_Ages ; and More was far too well_read not to have come_across it in one or several of the forms thus given it . But although the idea of communism is very old even in More 's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it is not communism as_such that we are concerned with . We are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus : Platonic , Stoic , early Christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism ; we are concerned with Utopian communism - that_is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia , as More conceived it .</context>

The <head>lawyer</head> did n't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner_party - Thayer , like himself , Madden reflected , was the extra man so prized by hostesses - and found him easy enough to talk to . But he did n't play golf , did n't seem to belong_to any local clubs - his work took him away a_lot , of_course - which probably accounted_for his tendency to keep_to_himself . Garth 's glance began to flicker to his watch . He said that he had already told the police_chief that he did n't know what insurance man had recommended Johnston to Mrs._Meeker .</context>

      <context> Pauling looked doubtful . Madden explained that he was thinking_of an application sent directly to Mrs._Meeker .

Madden said that he would see him at two and made another call , this one to Mrs._Meeker 's <head>lawyers</head> . Mr._Hohlbein was out for the day , but Mr._Garth would be free at one-thirty .

He disliked Garth on sight , conservative clothes and haircut , smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties , handclasp too consciously quick and firm . Youngish man on_the_make , Madden labeled him , and was ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion , the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions ; that Mrs._Garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young <head>lawyer</head> ; that there were three children , two boys and a girl ; that she was active in the Woman 's Club and he in Lions , Rotary , and Jaycee ; and finally , that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their wedding_day . Madden knew that he could be completely wrong about all this , but also knew that he would go right on disliking Garth . Garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair , which would not , he said more than once , have ever come_about if Mrs._Meeker had only seen fit to consult Mr._Hohlbein or him about it .
