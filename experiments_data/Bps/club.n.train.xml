      <context> Twenty-one year old Milt_Pappas and Jerry_Walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers ' Art_Ditmar in Sunday 's 2 P.M. encounter . Ralph_Houk , successor to Casey_Stengel at the Yankee helm , plans to bring the entire New_York squad here from St._Petersburg , including Joe_Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games . The famed Yankee_Clipper , now retired , has been assisting as a batting_coach . Pitcher Steve_Barber joined the <head>club</head> one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army 's accelerated wintertime military course , also at Fort_Knox , Ky. . The 22 - year old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen . Baltimore 's bulky spring_training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul_Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit . `` Take a ride on this one '' , Brooks_Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third_sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third inning two run double off the left centerfield wall tonight .</context>

      <context> Rookie southpaw George_Stepanovich relieved Hyde at_the_start of the ninth and gave_up the A 's fifth tally on a walk to second_baseman Dick_Howser , a wild_pitch , and Frank_Cipriani 's single under Shortstop Jerry_Adair 's glove into center . The Orioles once_again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas_City pitchers . Three were doubles , Brooks_Robinson getting a pair and Marv_Breeding one . Bill_Kunkel , Bob_Hartman and Ed_Keegan did the mound chores for the <head>club</head> down from West_Palm_Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami_Stadium . The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took_over in the top of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee_Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning appearance , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally .</context>

Moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra_points during each practice_session . `` If you kick too_much , your leg gets kinda dead '' , he explained . In their first three games , the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per_cent their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries .</context>
