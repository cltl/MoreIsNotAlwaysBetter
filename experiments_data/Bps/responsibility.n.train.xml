      <context> In the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use . But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable . Consultation with architects , clients , real_estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work . Fortunately , although only a_few years ago they held the student at_arms_length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not_only from an increased sense of community <head>responsibility</head> but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior_designer of tomorrow - that the student already is `` in the trade '' . Even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern_slides . Here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced . The professional organizations such_as American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers , National_Society_of_Interior_Designers , Home_Fashions_League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work .</context>

      <context> One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . The Conference called_for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives . In 1930 , the Lambeth_Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate . In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth_control as the <head>responsibility</head> laid by God on parents everywhere . Many other Protestant_denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action . In March , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the Federal_Council_of_Churches ratified artificial methods of birth_control . `` As_to the necessity '' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question .</context>

      <context> What determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive . In_general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical . This development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National_Council_of_Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the US . The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian <head>responsibility</head> in family_planning . It called_for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives . The general board declared : `` Most_of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right . The general Protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' .</context>

      <context> I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them . If they were , Walter_Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George_Sokolsky , and Herblock would have nothing to draw cartoons about . I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions . The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity ; and in_particular - since this is our special <head>responsibility</head> - that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United_States . I speak_of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved - ever - reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human_beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around . These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism . This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in_practice , antithetical to these conditions ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization .</context>

      <context> Corporations are apt by_nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public . The proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board_of_directors and stockholders . Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop . Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal <head>responsibility</head> so sorely needed now . Hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest . Proprietorships should get the tax_advantages now accruing to corporations , e._g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth . Corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ) .</context>

      <context> The right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated . To perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming_to_the_fore , and is basically anti democratic . When the proprietor dies , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it . Strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting_as controllers of the corporation whose <head>responsibility</head> to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part of the whole . Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship . Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so . If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic_system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ?</context>

      <context> To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed <head>responsibility</head> for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services . Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry_out the provisions of the Act . The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational_rehabilitation_program , providing_for a three part grant structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational_rehabilitation - and in_addition for short-term training and instruction . The first part of the new structure - that for supporting the basic program of vocational_rehabilitation services - is described in this Section .</context>

      <context> After the recommendation of the Department is forwarded to the appeal_board , that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial . This he did .

The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a colleague , a question from the Secretary or the President , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the agenda of the United_Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies , a news_item read at the breakfast_table , a question to the President or the Secretary at a news_conference , a speech by a Senator or Congressman , an article in a periodical , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad , et_cetera , ad_infinitum .

His first thought is about the question itself : Is there a question here for American foreign_policy , and , if so , what is it ?

      <context> Although the elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates . With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly . Both parties and the Ministry_of_the_Interior were busily at_work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance . Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party <head>responsibility</head> and the educational effect of mass political participation . The general setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization . The concentration of effective power in Rabat leads not_only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in_addition to contributing to more meaningful elections . Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber_of_Commerce elections , which took_place three weeks before national elections .</context>
