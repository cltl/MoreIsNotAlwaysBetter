      <context> The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League_clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas_City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . Indications as_late_as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory <head>drought</head> as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage . Over the first five frames , Jack_Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in_the_middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American_League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick_Hyde , submarine_ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock . A two run homer by Norm_Siebern and a solo_blast by Bill_Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts .</context>

      <context> No_matter how well work is planned , bad_weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught_up . It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably . Production may fall far below expectations . <head>Drought</head> , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops . Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner 's earnings , even into his capital . Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year . The high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis .</context>

      <context> In_fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers . There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision . A meteor could fall on San_Francisco . Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or <head>drought</head> . Our understanding of the solar_system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing . Yet we no_longer feel uneasy . This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in_common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war .</context>
