      <context> Jen_Nelson , as Thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive . And little Zeme_North , a Dora with real spirit and verve , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for Floyd , the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings . Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` On_the_Side_of_the_Angels '' and `` Politics_and_Poker '' were handled splendidly , and I thought Rudy_Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` Little_Tin_Box '' even better than it was done by the New_York cast ; all the words of its clever lyrics came_through with perfect clarity . The party at Floyd 's penthouse gave the `` chorines '' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed <head>routines</head> which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era 's nonsense . LaGuardia 's multi lingual rallies , when he is running for Congress , are well staged , and wind_up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical_theater . Martin_Tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions . Not a corner has been visibly cut in this one .</context>

      <context> Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer : `` Now I lay me down to sleep , The gray-backs o ' er my body creep ; If they should bite before I wake , I pray the Lord their jaws to break '' `` . Charles_Thiot , a splendid Georgia soldier , differed from most_of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of_age . But he was very_much_like his associates in his hatred of camp <head>routine</head> . Near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups , name one of them `` fall-in '' and the other `` close-up '' , and_then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of ' fall-in ' and ' close-up '' ' . The soldiers who comprised the rank_and_file of the Civil_War armies were an earthy people . They talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body .</context>

      <context> Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland_Yard , Holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police . They for their part are convinced that Holmes is too `` unorthodox '' and `` theoretical '' to make a good detective . Why do the police find Holmes `` unorthodox '' ? On_the_face_of_it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police <head>routine</head> . Another , more interesting explanation , is hinted at by Watson when he observes on several occasions that Holmes would have made a magnificent criminal . The great detective modestly agrees . Watson 's insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes and his arch opponent , Dr._Moriarty .</context>

      <context> The mythological private_eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways . On_the_one_hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed . As a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client . For this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 <head>routine</head> . On_the_other_hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; no client would ever think_of asking him to do such things . Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private_eye ends_up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder . Operating as a one_man police_force in fact if not in_name , he is at_once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves .</context>

      <context> Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants ; he is prone to semi catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln ; he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist . Holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds . His eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom . It was in_order to avoid the stuffy <head>routine</head> of middle_class life that Holmes became a detective in_the_first_place . As he informs Watson , `` My life is spent in one long effort to escape_from the commonplaces of existence . These little problems help me to do so '' . Holmes is a public servant , to_be_sure ; but the society which he serves bores him to tears .</context>

      <context> And_then : `` There are lots of kids around here '' . Scotty looked at the children , his mouth slightly opened , his eyes dull . He felt tired and full and calm . The days seemed short , perhaps because his <head>routine</head> was , each_day , almost the same . He rose late and went_down in his bathrobe and slippers to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel . Virginia treated him with_attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food : biscuits , cookies , candies - the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen . She would hover over him and , looking_like her brother , anxiously watch the progress of Scotty 's fork or spoon .</context>

      <context> It was the call of the wild all_right . That evening turned_out to be hell like all the others . We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill . It was the same old <head>routine</head> . Eileen got_to dancing , just a_little tiny dancing step to a hummed tune that you could hardly notice , and trying to pick_up strange men , but each time I was ready to say to_hell_with_it and walk_out she 'd pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet husky voice about the good times and the happiness we 'd had together and there I was back on_the_hook . I did have the decency to call_up Thelma and tell her I 'd met old friends and would be home late . `` I could scratch her eyes out '' , Eileen cried and stamped her foot when I came_back from the phone_booth .</context>

      <context> He worked standing , with his left hand in his pocket as_though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person 's hand . Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved . It all seemed - if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows - as_though this broken nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler 's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss 's work . This air of disengagement carried_over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious <head>routine</head> . But he was not bored at_all ; he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it . There are , after_all , fortunate souls who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey was , as things go , a fortunate man . He left his home the day after New_Year 's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat .</context>

      <context> It was merely an attempt to frighten her . She would n't go_back to New_York as Maude suggested ; she would n't run like a scared cat . But - well , she 'd be very careful . She dressed and the accustomed <head>routine</head> restored to her a sense of normal everyday life . But before she left her room she dug_into her big moire bag , took_out the envelope holding her marriage_contract and the wax seal had been broken . So somebody else knew what would happen to her father 's money if she died . Rev had known all_along .</context>

But , admit or not , Bonner was helpless . The crime showed too much planning , the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist .</context>

      <context> Garth 's glance began to flicker to his watch . He said that he had already told the police_chief that he did n't know what insurance man had recommended Johnston to Mrs._Meeker . He would offer no theory to account_for her murder . The whole_thing , his manner conveyed , was so far outside the normal <head>routine</head> of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept_under_the_rug . No_doubt Mrs._Meeker had snubbed him many_a time and he felt no grief over her passing . Even_so , Madden 's dislike of the suave , correct lawyer deepened . It would be all_right with him , he decided , if his investigation of the fraud , with its probable by-product of murder , led to Garth 's door .</context>
