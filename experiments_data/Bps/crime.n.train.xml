      <context> Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final_Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living_space through violence , economic_strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . In_other_words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted_on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder . This , in_fact , it turned_out to be . Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed_forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of_it , conscious accomplices of Hitler 's <head>crimes</head> ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually . What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man_of_affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No_doubt many_of the citizens of the Third_Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today .</context>

      <context> Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states . Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable <head>crimes</head> ? The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the nations .</context>

      <context> The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten - the gas_chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star_of_David - nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . Public_relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried_out : Too_much , too_much - the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had_to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most_of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing_on the corpus_delicti of the total Nazi <head>crime</head> but seemed subject_to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs . Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection . Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought_on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr._Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies .</context>

      <context> For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief . Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil_law is concerned with public <head>crimes</head> . Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil_authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin . Among the chief victims of such an ill_conceived imposition would be religion itself .</context>

      <context> In the American `` hardboiled '' detective_story of the ' 20 s and ' 30 s , the spirit of the mad genius from Baker_Street lives on . Like Holmes , the American private_eye rejects the social conventions of his time . But unlike Holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt . Surrounded by <head>crime</head> and violence everywhere , the `` hardboiled '' private_eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation . His alienation is far more acute than Holmes ' ; he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast . With Rex_Stout 's Nero_Wolfe , alienation is represented on a purely physical plane . Wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house , and spends most_of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids .</context>

      <context> A similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of Eric_Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery_stories , Dashiell_Hammett 's The Maltese_Falcon . Sam_Spade joins_forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; but when the bird is found at_last , it turns_out to be a fake . Now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves , who is also the real murderer . For Sam_Spade , neither <head>crime</head> nor virtue pays ; moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two . Because the private_eye intends to save society in_spite_of himself , he invariably finds himself in_trouble with the police . The latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care . In either case , they do not appreciate the private_detective 's zeal .</context>

      <context> As a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client . For this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine . On_the_other_hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; no client would ever think_of asking him to do such things . Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private_eye ends_up by investigating and solving a <head>crime</head> , usually a murder . Operating as a one_man police_force in fact if not in_name , he is at_once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves . He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at_all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished . Thus the fictional detective is much more_than a simple businessman .</context>

      <context> In_order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl_friend . What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock_Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private_eye is in danger of turning_into his opposite . It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery_story which creates this fatal dilemma . By upholding his own personal code_of_behavior , the private_detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with <head>crime</head> and corruption . That society responds by condemning the private_eye as a threat to the status_quo , a potential criminal . If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society . He must , in_short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel .</context>

      <context> Since the strength of the Mexicans had been underrated , too small a posse had been collected , and since the deputy had not been provided with search_warrants , MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw . The posse 's retreat encouraged the Mexicans to be overbearing and impudent . During the following week , six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned ; some buildings , farm tools , two horses , plows , and hay owned by Bonito_Lavato , a friendly interpreter for the company , and Pedro_Chavez ' hay were stolen or destroyed ; and a store was broken into and robbed . District_Attorney M._W._Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these <head>crimes</head> or carrying arms - he just did n't catch anyone . Increasing threats on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New_Mexico . His friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense , perpetuating the troubles . By early summer , he wrote from Laramie that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in_a_bad_way financially , so Pels sent him a draft for $ 100 , warning that it was still not wise for him to return .</context>

      <context> The Providence_Daily_Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings . The Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace . On October 31 , 1859 , John_Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder . For these <head>crimes</head> he was sentenced to be hanged in_public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 . Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia . Although Rhode_Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John_Brown 's trial with extreme interest . On Wednesday morning , November_2 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fairer trial .</context>

      <context> But Sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly : `` Let 's go and see what it_'s like '' . Annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham , near the Georgia border and on the Tallahoosa_River , a small and dirty stream . The city was a center of manufacture , especially in textiles , and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings , a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama . But it had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black_Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived - servants and laborers huddled_together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and <head>crime</head> . Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city over ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were . Beyond were industries and factories .

      <context> Such was the impromptu that Voltaire gave to howls of laughter at Sans_Souci and that was soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of Europe , to be printed sometime later , but with the name of Timon_of_Athens , the famous misanthrope , substituted for that of Rousseau .
