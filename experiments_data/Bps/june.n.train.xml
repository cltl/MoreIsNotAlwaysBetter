      <context> Whenever there is a thaw or a_few sunny days , you 'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two . If those are n't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February during a particularly cold winter . I started the seed in a flat in <head>June</head> and set_out the little pansies in a cold_frame . ( An unheated greenhouse would have been better , if I had had one . ) The plants took zero nights in their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them . In response to the lengthening days of February they budded , then bloomed their 4 - inch velvety flowers .</context>

      <context> The disasters of 1825 - 1826 caused more to leave . After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick . In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June . On <head>June</head> 24 more than 400 families started the three month trip across the plains to the Mississippi . By fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort_Snelling , but most_of them were sent_on to Galena and St._Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United_States . In 1837 , 157 Red_River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort_Snelling . Below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi_River .</context>

      <context> Accordingly , though the practice violated the no trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's_Bay_Company , some settlers went into trade . The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought_in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain_from trading in furs . Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort_Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs . In <head>June</head> 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per_cent duty on imports via Hudson's_Bay which were viewed_as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' . To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company 's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain_from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . With their customary source of supply cut_off , the Fort_Garry free_traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country . Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St._Paul and goods from St._Paul to Red_River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement .</context>

      <context> In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the Forks '' ( Fort_Douglas ) and in December 1819 , twenty men left Fort_Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie_du_Chien . It was a three month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats . With these completed and ice gone from the St._Peter's_River ( present-day Minnesota river ) their 250 bushels of wheat , 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to Big_Stone_Lake , across into Lake_Traverse , and down the Red . They reached Fort_Douglas in <head>June</head> 1820 . This epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk 1040 . Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort_Daer for food . Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round .</context>

It argued , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both General_Motors and du_Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; that the tremendous volume of General_Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General_Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity . General_Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as_required by the mandate of_this Court .

      <context> Retired pay costs are increased by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel . These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $ 56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army_Reserve components during 1961 . Traditionally , rates_of_pay for retired military_personnel have been proportionate to current rates_of_pay for active personnel . The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing_for a 6 % increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of <head>June</head> 1 , 1958 . I endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay_rates . - Expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed_Forces are estimated to be $ 10.3 billion in 1961 , which is $ 184 million more than in 1960 . The increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment .</context>

      <context> The constant temperature contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm by Coates ( 1959 a ) , and apparently the emission at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features . Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave_lengths in_order_that the radio_emission of the moon can be properly interpreted . The observations of Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described . Measurements at 3.15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 to <head>June</head> 19 , 1956 , using the 50 - foot reflector at the U.S._Naval_Research_Laboratory in Washington . The half-intensity diameter of the antenna beam was about 9 ' , and the angle subtended by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes . The antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 b ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid_angle of the moon was known . The ratio of the measured antenna temperature_change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85 .</context>

      <context> Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use . Although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups . The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia . This patient was a 65 - year old white male accountant who entered the New_York_Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on <head>June</head> 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . In 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood_transfusions were given over a period of 4 years . Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered foci of fibrosis '' suggestive_of myelofibrosis . No additional transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily .</context>

These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism . Severe back pain in <head>June</head> , 1959 , prompted a third hospital admission . Extensive osteoporosis with partial collapse of D8 was found . A high protein diet , calcium_lactate supplements , and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness .
