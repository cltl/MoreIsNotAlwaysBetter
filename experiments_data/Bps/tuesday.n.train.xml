      <context> When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system - a system which the party opposes in its platform . Sam_Caldwell , State_Highway_Department public_relations director , resigned <head>Tuesday</head> to work for Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd 's campaign . Caldwell 's resignation had been expected for some time . He will be succeeded by Rob_Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years . When the gubernatorial campaign starts , Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd .</context>

Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according_to Republicans who attended .</context>

      <context> The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark . Mary_Dobbs_Tuttle was back at the organ .

Lefty Wyman_Carey , another Denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran John_Tsitouris at 8 o'clock <head>Tuesday</head> night .

      <context> When the same sequence is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions which I am to leave , dominant stress is ordinarily on instructions . It is clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the spoken_language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written . Other examples follow . `` I 'll come by <head>Tuesday</head> . I can n't be happy long without drinking water '' . In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent_to on Tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken_language ; but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a prepositional unit used as an adjunct , by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at_most . In the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking_water is equivalent_to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water .</context>

      <context> Laura touched his hand . `` Yes , I know , Fritzie . I should have '' . The heat intensified on <head>Tuesday</head> . Southern_California gasped and blinked under an autumn hot_spell , drier , more enervating , more laden with man 's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer past . It could continue this way , hitting 106 and more in the Valley , Joe_McFeeley knew , into October . He and Irvin_Moll were sipping coffee at the breakfast bar .</context>

      <context> No need say anything at_all to the old_woman . She had it all planned out , how she 'd do . She 'd say she did n't feel good on Sunday , could n't go_to church - there 'd be a little argument , but she could be stubborn - and when the old_woman had gone , quick pack the things she 'd need to take , all but the dress she 'd wear Monday , and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight , for a dime . Then on Monday morning - or it might have to be <head>Tuesday</head> - get_up and leave just the usual time , and last thing , put the money in an envelope under the old_woman 's purse there in the drawer . She would n't be going_to get that for an hour or_so after Katya had left , go do the daily shopping . No need leave a note with it , either - or maybe just something like , Do n't worry about me , I 'm going_away to make a better life . A better life .</context>

The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton 's studio - or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he did n't work there himself - and joined the life_class , which met every <head>Tuesday</head> and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning . It was an awkward hour , but I did n't have to punch any time_clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a_couple_of hours later at the drawing_board to finish_up a job . After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they would n't feel lonely , and we used_to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading `` out to work '' . It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us .</context>
