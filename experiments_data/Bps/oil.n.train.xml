And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in American_Artist again , in his natal month of March !

      <context> But even on these , the palette often takes_over while the shotgun cools_off ! Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey_Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had - and this was limited to a_few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together - Roy developed his art by himself . In the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and_then to paint . He worked in <head>oil</head> for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the Academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium . Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique . It has been my privilege to paint with Roy_Mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of Batavia . More_often_than_not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting .</context>

      <context> But make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn_to camping is one of economy . Here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford . The American_Automobile_Association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes_up with an average daily expenditure figure of $ 29 . The AAA then splits it down this way : $ 10.50 for meals , $ 9.50 for lodging , $ 7 for gas and <head>oil</head> , and $ 2 for tips and miscellaneous . What does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? The $ 9.50 for lodging they save .

      <context> ( 1 ) As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do .

In the search for <head>oil</head> and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources . We have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate . The following discussion of_this subject has been adapted from the book Causes_of_Catastrophe by L._Don_Leet . At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday , April 18 , 1906 , San_Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake .</context>

      <context> In_addition , dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface_tension of liquids , including liquid greases . Greases , stains , and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface . In most cases , these soils are taken_up as liquids through capillary_action . In an essentially static system , an <head>oil</head> cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial_tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active_agent . The washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off the debris and acts , to some extent , as a dissolving and solvating agent . Greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water ; and natural waters , in_addition , often contain impurities such_as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove . Therefore , detergents are used .</context>

      <context> ( 1 ) Below the critical micelle concentration , monomers and some dimers are present . ( 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80 . ( 3 ) For anionics , these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups ( the ionized ends ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase . Obviously hydrophobic ( oleophilic ) substances such_as greases , <head>oils</head> , or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at_home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase . Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as_much_as approximately two-fold . Although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated , the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process . Related_to micelle formation is the technologically important ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil_water_interfaces in such a manner that the polar ( or ionized ) end of the molecule is directed towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase .</context>

Related_to micelle formation is the technologically important ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil_water_interfaces in such a manner that the polar ( or ionized ) end of the molecule is directed towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase . In the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant . Then during washing , the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed <head>oil</head> mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase . Obviously , a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in_place_of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil . Substances other_than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases . This is particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall_into the class of polyelectrolytes .</context>

      <context> When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesized '' - into larger planar shapes themselves simply in_order to maintain the integrity of the picture_plane . Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut_away too abruptly into depth ; and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump_out of plane . Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to_the_extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) . It was because of this chain-reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_objects , or at_least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in <head>oil</head> before the end of 1913 . Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there . Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities . Synthetic_Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this was the_point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it .</context>

      <context> It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's , which would confirm the date he assigns it . But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as_well_as of typography ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 . When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each . ( It makes no real difference that Braque 's collage is on_paper and eked_out in charcoal , while Picasso 's is on canvas and eked_out in <head>oil</head> . ) By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done . But here again , the surface declaring device both overshoots and falls_short_of its aim . For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives_way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief , which gives_way in_turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seems to contain both - or neither .</context>
