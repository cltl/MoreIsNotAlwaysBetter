      <context> The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test_suit to test the validity of the act , and_then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway_Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural_Roads_Authority bonds for rural road construction work . The department apparently intends to make the Rural_Roads_Authority a revolving_fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid_off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a <head>battle</head> in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov._Marvin_Griffin . The Highway_Department source told The_Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds . Schley_County_Rep._B._D._Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body 's action of Friday in voting itself a $ 10 per day increase in expense allowances . Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought .</context>

      <context> Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , he purchased great blocks of the Company's stock with the view to controlling its policies . Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116000 square_miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . The grant , which stretched southward to Lake_Traverse - the headwaters of the Red - was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York_Factory on Hudson_Bay . Thus at the same time that William_Henry_Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana_Territory and winning fame at the <head>battle</head> of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North_American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier . Seven hundred miles south of York_Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 . By October the little colony about Fort_Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 . Within a_few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called Meurons .</context>

      <context> Today he is a major - in the Regular_Army . So filled was Mel_Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was over , he took_on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment . After years of digging , nights and weekends , he put_together the big , profusely illustrated book , Of_Garryowen_and_Glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military_unit . The <head>battle</head> of the Naktong_River is just one example of how the battle_cry and the spirit of The Fighting_Seventh have paid_off . For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment . Take the case of Major_Marcus_A._Reno , who survived the Battle_of_The_Little_Big_Horn in 1876 . From the enlisted_men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus_Reno .</context>

      <context> Many_of his fellow officers refused to speak_to him . But when a board of inquiry was called to look_into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him . He was a member of The Fighting_Seventh . Although it was at the Battle_of_The_Little_Horn , about which more words have been written than any other <head>battle</head> in American history , that the 7_th_Cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then . Brevet_Major_General_George_Armstrong_Custer was the regiment 's first permanent commander and , like such generals as George_S._Patton and Terry_de_la_Mesa_Allen in their rise to military prominence , Custer was a believer in blood_and_guts warfare . During the Civil_War , Custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier_general at the age of 23 . He finished the war as a major_general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major_general in the history of the U._S. Army .</context>

      <context> It was the 7_th_Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial_Palace_of_the_Emperor . But still Mel_Chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four syllable word , `` Garryowen '' . The final proof was a small incident . It happened at the St._Patrick 's_Day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone_into <head>battle</head> for over three quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march . In_the_middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing_down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen . The faces belonged_to Lieutenant_Marvin_Goulding , his wife and their two children . And when the singing began , it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish songs the best .</context>

      <context> Each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god . Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him . Each is still glorified as a national hero . The first half of The_Charles_Men , ending on the climax of the <head>battle</head> of Poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second . After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous . Like Napoleon , he was the worst of losers . There are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity .</context>

      <context> If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic_system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ?

Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition . The <head>battle</head> is not easy . We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of_our_own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders .

      <context> These are few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned_reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes . The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion . If this is the case , one would expect that not_only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional_state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise . We pointed_out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic_disorders and neurotic symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( `` abreaction '' ) may cure a <head>battle</head> neurosis . This phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may_not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses . Being a strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself . Wolpe 's experiments and therapeutic work lie_in this area .</context>

Without exception Hino 's brothers turned_to either one or both of their father 's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller .
