      <context> One night , so some of these theories run , Adam would have fallen_asleep , much_as he fell_asleep for the creation of Eve ; and thus he would have been carried_over into the life_eternal . The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural_order of time and change . On_the_other_hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence . It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the <head>law</head> . If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator . This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced . If death receives more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through Christ begins to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence .</context>

      <context> Recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction . He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as_well_as of mortality . Therefore Irenaeus describes man 's creation as_follows : `` So_that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted_up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take_up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a <head>law</head> was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all . And He laid_down for him certain conditions : so_that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' . These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result . There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) .</context>

His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated . Chapter 8 , is entitled `` On_Magnetism '' and in it are included such remarks as , `` One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic_forces with the electrical forces . The great resemblance between electrical and magnetic_attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their <head>laws</head> necessarily would bring_about this comparison . It is true , that nothing has been found comparable_with electricity by communication ; but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending_on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference . The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form . There , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism .</context>

      <context> At 12 , Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science . His earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life . In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University_of_Copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session . While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied <head>law</head> . The brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt . They supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could . So impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society .</context>

      <context> In_general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical . This development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National_Council_of_Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the US . The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family_planning . It called_for opposition to <head>laws</head> and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives . The general board declared : `` Most_of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right . The general Protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' . An action once universally condemned by all Christian_churches and forbidden by the civil_law is now not_only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant_denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty .</context>

      <context> This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country . Repeated polls have disclosed that most married_couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth_control . For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of <head>law</head> and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief . Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil_law is concerned with public crimes . Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil_authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin .</context>

This means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring .

      <context> The Roman_Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end . This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God 's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements . Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race . Moreover , man may_not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by God , who through the <head>law</head> of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception . Believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws_of_nature , Roman_Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them . Let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between Protestants and Roman_Catholics appear to be irreconcilable .

Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry_out the provisions of the Act . The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational_rehabilitation_program , providing_for a three part grant structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational_rehabilitation - and in_addition for short-term training and instruction .</context>

      <context> By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of <head>law</head> '' . I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed .

These contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed_Forces in the years ahead .

      <context> There were rumors that the Ministry_of_the_Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings . The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be supported by the King himself . The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called_in and notices of further investigation appeared from_time_to_time . In January , 1958 , the Minister_of_the_Interior announced that an election <head>law</head> was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied . In late 1957 the M.P. ( Mouvement_Populaire ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council_of_Government under Balafrej was formed without support from progressive elements in the party . The parties were on_the_whole unprepared for elections , while the people were still experiencing post independence let-down and suffering the after_effects of poor harvests in 1957 .</context>

From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results . In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance . In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence , but in a system where there is as_yet no place for the less prominent .</context>

A nation such_as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied_upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin_American countries ; out_of_the_question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa . This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19_th century scholars . More emphasis was put upon the fact that international_law was the <head>law</head> of `` civilized nations '' ; Kent and Story , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made_use_of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent . Wheaton stated that the public_law was essentially `` limited to the civilized and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European origin '' . Of_course it had always been of European origin in_fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural_law theory . Now , with virtually every writer , not_only was the European origin of public_law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others .</context>

The <head>law</head> of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality . It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action .</context>

      <context> On Wednesday morning , November_2 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fairer trial . The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted . The readers of the Providence_Daily_Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old_Brown '' had a fair trial . Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her <head>laws</head> , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' . In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical . J._Wheaton_Smith , editor of the Warren_Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in_order_that all those misnamed philantropists [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' . The editor of the Newport_Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment .</context>
