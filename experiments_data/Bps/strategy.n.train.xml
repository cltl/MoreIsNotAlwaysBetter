      <context> Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis . They have to be . With greater investments in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can n't switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible - or at_least not as economically . Are planning and <head>strategy</head> development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? We find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning . Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ? Do you have a long-term ( 5 - or 10 - yr . ) marketing program ?</context>

      <context> There has been an intensification of price consciousness in recent years ; there is every indication it will continue . Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers . Despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before - traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer . Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing <head>strategy</head> will be on target : Has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? Have you actually checked_out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ?</context>

      <context> To the manufacturer of the more convenient type product - the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put_off entirely - the implications are important . Your competition is now proportionately greater - you are competing not_only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products . Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer 's dollar being spent on their particular products . Has your company thought through its <head>strategy</head> in this whole `` discretionary buying '' area ? The trends have been in_evidence for many years - population_shifts to the Southwest and Far_West , and from city to suburbs . These shifts will continue in the next 10 yr. . Have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in_terms_of sales_force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ?</context>

      <context> We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry - at both the manufacturing and retail ends . Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts . The change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention - practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted . Have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing <head>strategy</head> to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under_way during the first decade . As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share_in the manufacturer 's as_well as the distributor 's profits - which is , in_effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do . Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded .</context>

      <context> For over a_hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them . It 's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly . By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ? The traditional <head>strategy</head> of the South has been to expose the vices of the North , to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that '' ( as James 's Christopher_Newman said to his adversaries ) `` however bad I may be , you 're not quite the people to say it '' . In the pre Civil_War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory_worker of the North . At the present_time , the counter-attack takes the line that there 's no more of the true spirit of `` integration '' in the North than in the South . The line is a pretty good one .</context>

      <context> On April 25 , the White_House reported that a total embargo of remaining U._S. trade with Cuba was being considered . Its aim : To undermine further Cuba 's economy . weaken Castro . Another <head>strategy</head> - bolder and tougher - was also attracting notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world , destroy Castro . Blockade , in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe_Doctrine . It could halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro . It could stop Cuban re export of guns and propaganda materials to South_America .</context>

      <context> It could halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro . It could stop Cuban re export of guns and propaganda materials to South_America . It would be the most severe reprisal , short_of declared war , that the United_States could invoke against Castro . It is the <head>strategy</head> of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , Members of Congress , officers in the Pentagon . As a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions . Among these questions : Military experts say a tight naval_blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task_forces , each built around an aircraft_carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers .</context>

In a broad sense , it would reaffirm the Monroe_Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western_Hemisphere . It could , by avoiding direct intervention , provide a short-of war <head>strategy</head> to meet short-of war infiltration . Primary target would be shipments of tanks , guns , aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia . Shipments of arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as contraband . In a total blockade , action could also be taken against ships bringing_in chemicals , oils , textiles , and even foodstuffs .</context>

      <context> <head>Strategy</head> and tactics of the U._S. military_forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history . The change of emphasis from conventional type to missile type warfare must be made with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other . Our military_forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us , from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war . - This budget will provide in the fiscal_year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level - a year-end strength of 2489000 men and women in the active forces .</context>

      <context> And it was clear that Adrien was not mistaken , for both Small and Cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant_mast till Philip_Spencer had given the signal to obey . Then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work . Alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed . Their <head>strategy</head> was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by Philip_Spencer 's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated . When the mast was raised , Alexander gave the order for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers . Spencer 's potential followers were openly sullen and morose , missing muster without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons , communicating with the three by glance and signal .
