      <context> Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing . In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native_land . The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission . After this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men ; a world beset with new boundaries , new <head>treaties</head> and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation - hunger and exposure . In this changed world , Prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose . Here , this happy , roving son of good_fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world . Here , Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism - producing music for the masses .</context>

He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing .

But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy , well established precedents , the commitments of the United_States under international charters and <head>treaties</head> , basic statutes , and well understood notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such_as country papers and National_Security_Council papers accumulated in the Department . He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted . He must think_about which of these principles must take precedence . He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance .</context>

      <context> It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies . We have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways . We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period_of_time . With the exception of <head>treaty</head> making , foreign relations were historically concerned for_the_most_part with conditions of short or at_least measurable duration . Foreign_policy now takes_on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection . American and free-world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition ; but basically that pace depends_on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes , political institutions , and social_structure which each society must generate . It follows that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working horizon .</context>
