      <context> State_Party_Chairman_James_W._Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking_up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen._John_Tower will be the featured speaker . In the Blue_Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting_precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according_to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more <head>term</head> to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system - a system which the party opposes in its platform . Sam_Caldwell , State_Highway_Department public_relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd 's campaign .</context>

      <context> The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann 's intention . His point is not that mythology may_not be used , but that it may no_longer be regarded_as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma . When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence . Mythological concepts may by_all_means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that_is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in non mythological ( or existential ) <head>terms</head> . The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith '' . But this statement is completely unconvincing . If Bultmann 's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant .</context>

      <context> Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in_fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter . Those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather_than specific skills ought_to bear_in_mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience . I have been using the word `` vocational '' as a layman would at_first_sight think it should be used . I intend to include under the <head>term</head> all the practical courses open to boys and girls . These courses develop skills other_than those we think_of when we use the adjective `` academic '' . Practically all_of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high_school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at_once on the basis of the skill . They are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high_school .</context>

      <context> Most_of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high_schools . In this respect , public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts . The neighborhood high_schools are not , strictly_speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high_school instead of the local school . Indeed , one school_superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the <head>term</head> comprehensive high_school for the senior_high_schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational_programs . He prefers to designate such schools as `` general '' high_schools . The suburban high_school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high_school because of the absence of vocational_programs . The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community .</context>

      <context> In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon_Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human_beings and events . But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap . I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth . I use this <head>term</head> to mean three things : a search for the human significance of an event or state_of_affairs , a tendency to look_at wholes rather_than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling . It is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia . I think these attributes cluster , but I have no evidence . In_fact , I can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art .</context>

      <context> Men seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that_is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized . Feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation . A need so deeply planted , asking for direction , so_to_speak , is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature . The <head>terms</head> `` renewal '' and `` refreshed '' , which often come_up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal '' of purpose and a `` refreshed '' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction . The notion of `` inspiration '' is somehow cognate to this feeling . How literature does this , or for whom , is certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the `` message '' , as_well_as the source , would all play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense_of_purpose . One of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion .</context>

      <context> It is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in_the_end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight . But , in_general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other . At this point a working definition of idea is in_order , although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed . The <head>term</head> idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as_opposed_to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience . It is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy . An idea , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned . In this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas , that are so_to_speak `` writ_large '' in history of literature where they recur continually .</context>

      <context> ( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade . Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line_of_work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation requiring a great_deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour . It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more_than the foregoing facts [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological <head>terms</head> , that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , - that_is , from one end to the other - was unimpaired '' . If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense_of_touch can be explained by his defective visual condition . But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at_hand . In what ways , then , did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself ?</context>

Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in_theory or in_practice . Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; even houses changed once a decade ; six hours of manual_labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; no private_property , no money ; no sort of pricing at_all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the <head>term</head> . Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist . It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that informs those details .

If , on_the_other_hand , they opted_for representation , it had to be representation per_se - representation as image pure_and_simple , without connotations ( at_least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed .

      <context> Back_and_forth Duclos had_to go , between M._de_Cury and Jean_Jacques and between the Duke_d'Aumont and Jean_Jacques again , as his little operetta , The_Village_Soothsayer , though still unperformed , took_on ever more importance . And of_course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get_around among his closest friends . But they , naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at_large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles . How titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most glowing <head>terms</head> of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals . The furor was such_that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational . And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe , Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration , trembling lest his authorship become known , and at_the_same_time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer . He felt himself now , as he himself says in his Confessions , at a crucial point of his life .</context>

      <context> He could conceivably have wished to make sure ; Rev loved Honotassa , it was like a part of his breath and body ; Rev had stressed the need for money . Rev would never have tried to give her poison ! She thrust the envelope back in the bag ; there was no point in locking it up in the armoire now , it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen . And in_all_likelihood , by now , there was more than one person in the house who knew the <head>terms</head> of her marriage_contract . There was no point either in telling herself again what a fool she 'd been . She went downstairs and received another curious shock , for when Glendora flapped into the dining_room in her homemade moccasins , Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she had n't . `` Too much work this morning , Miss_Sarah - everybody gone like that '' -</context>

      <context> According to the myth , Old_Order then vanishes at stage_left and reappears at extreme stage_right , but director Shuz skillfully sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage_effects by simply having Miss_Arapacis walk across the stage . The night we saw it , a rather unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the armadillo , complaining - in ad-lib - that `` it smelled '' . We caught the early train to New_York . The Dharma_Dictionary , a list of highly unusual <head>terms</head> used in connection with Eurasian proto-senility cults . It 's somewhat off_the_beaten_track , to_be_sure , but therein lies its variety and charm . For_example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate . Likewise , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely synonyms as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue-twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen '' all originated_in the same village in Bathar-on-Walli_Province and are all used to express sentiments concerning British `` imperialism '' .</context>

The <head>terms</head> are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start spouting them to your date , it might be best to find_out if he was a member of Major_Pockmanster 's Delhi_Regiment , since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in_that outfit . The_Breeze_And_Chancellor_Neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concerns the attempts of a West German politician to woo a plaster_cast of the Apollo_Belvedere . As you have doubtless guessed already , the plot is plastered with Freudian , Jungian , and Meinckian theory . For_example , when the film is only four minutes old , Neitzbohr refers to a small , Victorian piano_stool as `` Wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano_stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of_course , was Doris ( the English equivalent , when passed_through middle Gaelic derivations , of Wilhelmina ) .</context>

      <context> Dear Sirs : Let me begin by clearing_up any possible misconception in your minds , wherever you are . The collective by which I address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial <head>term</head> in_use among professional thieves . It is , I am reliably given to understand , the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost ; i.e. , burglars who rob while the tenants are absent , in contrast to hot slough prowlers , those who work while the occupants are home . Since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior . Far from it ; I merely draw an etymological distinction , hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman .</context>
