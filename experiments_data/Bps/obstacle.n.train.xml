      <context> The promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it . His answer was simple but honest . He just shot at the board and_then drew circles around the holes to form a bull's-eye . One of the <head>obstacles</head> to the easy control of a 2 - year old child is a lack of verbal communication . The child understands no . He senses his mother 's disapproval . But explanations leave him confused and unmoved .</context>

      <context> fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the nations . But though this characterization in_no_way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of_it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final_Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the <head>obstacle</head> of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? Should not everyone have been awakened to_it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard_to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by_no_means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .</context>

      <context> Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing_through this stage can be escaped . The United_States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face . At_the_same_time , we should recognize that the <head>obstacles</head> to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts . It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing_up to the intractable tasks at_home . We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene . When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold_war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not_only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development .</context>

      <context> Religion usually exercises a stabilizing conserving function . As_such it acts_as an anchor for the people . There is a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change , not_only in their own doctrines and policies and practices , but also in secular affairs having religious relevance . It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values , though also in some measure , an <head>obstacle</head> to the creation or diffusion of new ones . It tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments , the traditional ways of thinking , and the customary ways of living . As Yinger has pointed_out , the `` reliance on symbols , on tradition , on sacred_writings , on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turns one to the past far more than to the future '' . Historically , religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication , enforcement , sanction , and perpetuation of various other institutions .</context>

      <context> Nothing in_all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world . In final separation from them , in the railroad_terminal across the river from New_York , I would nearly cry . My parents ' welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted . But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or mess-hall kitchen but by the immense <head>obstacle</head> of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond . These letters became the center of my existence . I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer . My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when '' ; and_others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commencing again her piano_lessons , her private_school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe .</context>

      <context> Moreover , even getting this across would be difficult . For_one_thing , the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmen 's ; the sounds made by these organs were , therefore , dissimilar . It was true that they could be approximated , but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations ? Another <head>obstacle</head> was the grammatical construction of Siddo . Consider the tense_system . Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future , Siddo used an entirely different word . Thus , the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai , meaning to live , was , in the perfect_tense , ksu'u'peli'afo , and , in the future , mai'teipa .</context>
