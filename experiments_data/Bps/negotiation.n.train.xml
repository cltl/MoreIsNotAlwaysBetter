      <context> `` The logic of creating a strong , balanced , competitive two system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B._+_O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here . Detailed studies of the plan were well underway . Though far from completion , these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned , their investors , their customers , their users , and to the public at_large . Then , abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , B. + O. entered on-again-off-again <head>negotiations</head> with C. + O. which resulted in the present situation . In the light of the facts at_hand , however , New_York_Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two system eastern railroad structure in the public interest `` . The Interstate_Commerce_Commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed C._+_O._-_B. + O. merger on June 18 . Obviously , the Interstate_Commerce_Commission will not force the New_York_Central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge .</context>

In any given time_period , the aggregate demand for the industry 's product is determined by two things : the price charged by the industry , and the level of GNP .</context>
