      <context> A man must be able to say , `` Father , I have sinned '' , or there is no hope for him . Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` Second Inaugural '' that God `` gives to both North and South this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came '' . He also spoke_of `` the wealth piled by the bondsman 's two_hundred_and_fifty years in unrequited toil '' . Lincoln was historian and <head>economist</head> enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New_Englanders engaged in the slave_trade . After how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high_finance ) purified of taint ? It is a question which New_Englanders long_ago put out of their minds . But did n't they get_off too easy ?</context>

      <context> Let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong ; he is out_of_place in our times . Shakespeare 's Shylock , too , is of dubious value in the modern_world . Ideas , in and of themselves , are not necessarily the greatest good . A successful businessman recently prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all <head>economists</head> should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where they and their theories might rot together . Will his words come to be treasured and quoted through the years ? Frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in_the_end only the good ones will survive . But is that not like going_to a chemistry_laboratory and blindly pouring_out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder_drug inevitably to result ?</context>

      <context> To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the lot next_door . If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened_away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program . And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble . Today , according_to land <head>economist</head> Homer_Hoyt , shopping_centers and their associated parking_lots cover some 46000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land_area in all the nation 's Central Business_Districts put together . The downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety , both within its gates and across the street , where other department_stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making_up_her_mind . If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children 's clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too_much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount_business in big-ticket items . Department_stores were built_on dry_goods , especially ladies ' fashions , and in this area , in_the_long_run , the suburban branches will be hard_put to compete against downtown .</context>
