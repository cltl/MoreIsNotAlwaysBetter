The inference is overwhelming that du_Pont 's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit '' . 353_U._S._,_at_605 . This Court agreed with the <head>trial_court</head> `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not overlooked by either du_Pont or General_Motors '' . 353_U._S._,_at_606 . However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including du_Pont 's competitors '' , 353_U._S._,_at_607 , outweighed the Government 's claim for relief . This claim , as submitted to the District_Court and dismissed by it , 126_F._Supp .235 , alleged violation not_only of 7 of the Clayton_Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman_Act .</context>
