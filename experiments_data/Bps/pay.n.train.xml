      <context> While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked_out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set_aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87 - 31 . A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29 - 5 . As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action . Pelham pointed_out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on <head>pay</head> raises for future Legislature sessions . A veteran Jackson_County legislator will ask the Georgia_House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . Rep._Mac_Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided_that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would_like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' .</context>

      <context> Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would_like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday . It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the State_Board_of_Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher <head>pay</head> raises . After a long , hot controversy , Miller_County has a new school_superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election I ever saw in_this county '' . The new school_superintendent is Harry_Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix_Bush , a school_principal and chairman of the Miller_County_Democratic_Executive_Committee . Davis received 1119 votes in Saturday 's election , and Bush got 402 .</context>

      <context> The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for_example , costs $ 227.72 . Have the insurance_company or your own accounting department break_down the cost of your insurance package periodically . You may find certain coverage costing much more_than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions . Check to see if some of your benefits - such_as on-the-job disability <head>pay</head> - can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you . Use deductable insurance wherever feasible . It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates . Also , beware of open_end policies , especially in the medical field .</context>

      <context> It 's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods . For_example , the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington 's birthday . This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups . Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for <head>pay</head> . This cuts the absentee_rate . Consider using vending_machines rather than subsidized cafeterias . Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you .</context>

      <context> They bring their fishing_rods and binoculars and bathing_suits . They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance . There are a half_dozen reasons helping to account_for the migration to the campgrounds . Among them , according to the U._S. Department_of_Commerce , are : ( 1 ) shorter work_weeks , ( 2 ) higher <head>pay</head> , ( 3 ) longer paid_vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education .

But make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn_to camping is one of economy .</context>

They get all the glory and most_of the <head>pay</head> and do n't earn ten cents apiece on_the_average , the drunken rascals '' . Private George_Gray_Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote : `` I am well convinced in My own Mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago '' . Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state : `` I wish to God one_half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against [ the other half ] '' .

      <context> I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . I again proposed a reduction in the Army National_Guard and Army_Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal_year 1961 . These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives . - About 30 % of the expenditures for the Department_of_Defense in 1961 are for military_personnel costs , including <head>pay</head> for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel . These expenditures are estimated to be $ 12.1 billion , an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social_security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) . Retired pay costs are increased by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel . These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $ 56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army_Reserve components during 1961 .</context>

The increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment .</context>
