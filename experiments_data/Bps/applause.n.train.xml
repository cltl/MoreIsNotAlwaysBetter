      <context> By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today 's artists , the program turned_out to be a not quite perfect example of either . Still , the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated . Even Joan_Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan_Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti 's `` Lucia_di_Lammermoor '' Sunday night . The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and <head>applause</head> and finally a standing_ovation as Miss_Sutherland took curtain_call after curtain_call following a fantastic `` Mad_Scene '' created on_her_own and with the help of the composer and the other performers . Her entrance in Scene_2_,_Act_1 , brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note . Thereafter the audience waxed applause happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization . As she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` Lucia '' .</context>

Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` Mad_Scene '' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment .</context>

      <context> It is a question which New_Englanders long_ago put out of their minds . But did n't they get_off too easy ? The slaves never shared in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave owners : they were fed , clothed , doctored , and_so_forth ; they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care . Emerson - Platonist , idealist , doctrinaire - sounded a high Transcendental note in his `` Boston_Hymn '' , delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music_Hall amidst thundering <head>applause</head> : `` Pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim . Who is the owner ? The slave is owner , And ever was . Pay him '' !</context>

      <context> There is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting . They are in themselves neutral , and , so_far_as they get a moral quality , they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the onlooker . But if that is true , why is any attitude more fitting than any other ? Would <head>applause</head> , for_example , be fitting if , apart from the applause , there were nothing good to applaud ? Would condemnation be fitting if , independently of the condemnation , there were nothing bad to condemn ? In such a case , any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other , which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point . Indeed we are forced to go much farther .</context>

      <context> In Boston , Edwin_Booth was winding_up a performance of A_New_Way_to_Pay_Old_Debts . It was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think_about it any_more . Acting soothed him . On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the <head>applause</head> , he must be doing it better than usual . As Sir_Giles_Overreach ( how often had he had_to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he raised his arm and declaimed : `` Where is my honour now '' ? That was one of the high spots of the play . The audience , as_usual , loved it .</context>

      <context> To_that Rousseau could agree . But now what crazy twists and turns of his emotions ! Afraid at one_and_the_same time that his work might be turned_down - which would be a blow to his pride even_though no_one knew he was the author - and that the work would be accepted , and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in_spite_of himself . And how anxious this lover of obscurity was for <head>applause</head> ! And thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity , Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks . All these emotions were screwed_up to new heights when , after acceptance and the first rehearsals , there ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian music_lovers that Duclos had_to come running to Rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the King 's amusements , and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of Fontainebleau . Imagine the honor of_it !</context>

      <context> Twenty-four_hours had changed him from a performer to a freak . Within this framework , what followed was strained , even macabre . Eliminating the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal melancholy . The effect was as depressing as a gravestone , the <head>applause</head> irresolute and short-lived . Yet Andy plowed_ahead , mouthing the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning , and gradually his listeners warmed_to him . Their clapping grew more fervent ; the evening was still not beyond salvaging , not as a show but for him as a person . The worst was yet to come .</context>
