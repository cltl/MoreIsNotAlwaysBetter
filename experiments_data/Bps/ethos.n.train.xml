      <context> French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in_this country before the days of Popularism . The riotous onrush of industrialism after the War_for_Southern_Independence and the general secular drift to the Religion_of_Humanity , however , prepared the way for a reception of the French_Revolution 's socialistic offspring of one sort of another . The first of_which to find important place in our federal_government was the graduated income_tax under Wilson . Moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920 s , the dislocations of the Depression , the common <head>ethos</head> of Materialism everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced Mike_Fink and the Great_Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the Little_People . However , it is important to trace the philosophy of the French_Revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former . That John_Locke 's philosophy of the social_contract fathered the American_Revolution with its Declaration_of_Independence , I believe , we generally accept . Yet , after Rousseau had given the social_contract a new twist with his notion of the General Will , the same philosophy , it may be said , became the idea source of the French_Revolution also .</context>

      <context> The codes are mechanism for training in , and directing and enforcing , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group . Durkheim noted long_ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things - unite [ s ] into one single moral community - all those who adhere to them '' . His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit . This is brought_out in the common religious <head>ethos</head> that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United_States ; and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds . The unifying effect of religion is also brought_out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more_or_less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized . The Jews for 2500 years have been a prime example , though the adherents of any world or inter people religion are cases_in_point . it might be pointed_out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings - political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic .</context>
