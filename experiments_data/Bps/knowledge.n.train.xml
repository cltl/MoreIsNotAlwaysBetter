      <context> The aspects of physical development that catch the judges ' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion - superior definition of the muscles . Now good definition is one thing that all_of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light weight workouts . But contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor 's chisel - is something quite different . This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the <head>knowledge</head> of exactly what works best for him . Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others . Because they are `` minority '' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten . Only when the newest Mr._America or Mr._Universe rediscovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once_again see how effective they really are .</context>

      <context> Roy_Mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of John_Sell_Cotman . And like this English master , Mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in_reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them . As a boy Roy_Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods . His father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting_expeditions , and imparted to them his <head>knowledge</head> and love of nature . Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on_the_wing - almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . It is this subject_matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors . Mason had_to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting .</context>

      <context> The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it . In_fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in_this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears . In_fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty . Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased <head>knowledge</head> of the nature of disease .

This is what was meant , above , by describing history as inferential . The knowledge in_virtue_of_which a man is an historian is a <head>knowledge</head> of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events '' . It is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by_no_means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research . The student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at_the_same_time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another . Let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought - turning our attention from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades .</context>

Gas injection through a porous anode ( transpiration cooling ) not_only feeds_back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself .

But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of Igbo phonology .

If of the founders of glottochronology Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding , and Lees has repudiated his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should swerve .

      <context> While Protogeometric vases usually turn_up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as_many or more examples of local stamp , these `` non Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century . In their place came local variations within the common style - tentative , as_it_were , in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed . Attica , though important , was not the only teacher of this age . One can take a vase of about 800 B.C. and , without any <head>knowledge</head> of its place_of_origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable . The potters of the Aegean_islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland , and in Greece itself Argive , Corinthian , Attic , Boeotian , and other Geometric sequences have each their own hallmarks . These local variations were to become ever sharper in the next century and a half . The same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark_ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the survivals of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages .</context>
