      <context> He does n't think that potting them from a deck_chair on the south_side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting . But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish . It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel_de_Cervantes ' `` Don_Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide_screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth_Street and Sixty-eighth_Street_Playhouses . More_than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho_Panza , in seventeenth century <head>Spain</head> , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . Nikolai_Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander_Nevsky and Ivan_the_Terrible , performs the lanky Don_Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . His addle-brained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no_doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues . Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do .</context>

      <context> He was fifteen years older than I - forty four - but full of spring and sparkle . He did n't look_like what I thought_of as an old_man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger . He was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in America ; you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every_month . Life had included him in its `` Modern American Artists '' series and had photographed him at his studio in the East_Sixties ; the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have Velasquez in it painting the royalty of <head>Spain</head> . I had a long talk with him . We went_into Mrs._Monmouth 's library , which had low bookshelves all along the walls , and above them a Modigliani portrait , a Jackson_Pollock twelve feet long , and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow background , that looked_like an inscription from a Martian tomb . The fireplace had tiles made for Mrs._Monmouth by Picasso himself .</context>
