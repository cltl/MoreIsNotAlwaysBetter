      <context> A random address * * f that lies within the X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary form . If cell * * f is an information cell , it and any information cells in the Y-region that have been linked to * * f each contain an address in the W-region where a potentially matching form is stored . The dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms . When a <head>match</head> is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage . If cell * * f is not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list . These two steps essentially complete the lookup operation . The final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text form list , and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text .</context>

      <context> Again he stood in the darkness listening , but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor . He moved ahead carefully , his left_hand in_front of him , and came to a wooden partition . Horse smell was very strong , and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws . He found a <head>match</head> in his pocket and lit it . There were two horses in the barn , a sway-backed dun and Jess_Crouch 's buckskin . Curt snuffed_out the match . It was certain now that Jess was in the house , but also , presumably , was Stacey_Black .</context>

A <head>match</head> flared , and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop . As he crossed to_the side of the stall , Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer . `` Before you try anything '' , he said . `` Remember what happened to Gruller '' .</context>

      <context> It was spoiled now for seed , and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it . The oxen might as_well enjoy it .

The waters lay muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheels ; there was not a <head>match</head> width of damp mark to show they were receding . He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley . A terrible , numbing sense of futility swept_over him . He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat .</context>
