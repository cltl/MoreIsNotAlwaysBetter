      <context> This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations . To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores . Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing - and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them . One wife , described by a New_York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual_relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday night neighborhood <head>card</head> parties . Another put sex on a dollars and cents basis . After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband 's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor . Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .</context>

      <context> But dominant in the sense that every other objective , no_matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it . Peace is a worthy objective ; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin , then we must fight . Freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ; but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit , then Algerian freedom must be postponed . Justice is a worthy objective ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union_of_South_Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification <head>cards</head> yet a while longer . Prosperity is a worthy objective ; but if providing higher standards_of_living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made . It may be , of_course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in_favor_of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of Soviet Communist power . This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used .</context>

      <context> Thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes , and the random_variable is not the number of successes . The constancy of p and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in_practice . Obviously , very slight changes in p do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference . ( For_instance , see Example 2 of Section 5 - 5 , on red <head>cards</head> in hands of 5 . ) On_the_other_hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical_phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a baseline for comparative purposes ; that_is , we may discuss the phenomenon in_terms_of its departures from the binomial model . A binomial experiment consists_of * * f independent binomial trials , all with the same probability * * f of yielding a success . The outcome of the experiment is X successes .</context>
