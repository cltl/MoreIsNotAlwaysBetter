      <context> Pelham pointed_out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . A veteran Jackson_County legislator will ask the Georgia_House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . Rep._Mac_Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided_that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in <head>Washington</head> who would_like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday . It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the State_Board_of_Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises .</context>

The answer is , `` Yes '' ! Certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical_Symphony seriously , and with a good_deal of pleasure . His life-long friend , Serge_Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , New_York , and <head>Washington</head> , D._C. , to_which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation . Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world_premiere of the Love_for_Three_Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third_Piano_Concerto . `` Uncle_Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden_Twenties '' . We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano_sonatas , chamber_music , gavottes , and marches ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities .</context>

      <context> The shooting development program of the Sporting_Arms_and_Ammunition_Manufacturers_'_Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers . The most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting_preserves . This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the New_York staff of the Sportsmen's_Service_Bureau , and the SAAMI shooting_preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 . Following the kick-off of SAAMI 's shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took_place in <head>Washington</head> , D._C. . The group known_as the American_Association_for_Health_,_Physical_Education_,_and_Recreation ( a division of the National_Education_Association ) initiated a conference which brought_together representatives of the National_Rifle_Association , SAAMI and the American_Fishing_Tackle_Manufacturers . This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known_as the Outdoor_Education_Project . The Outdoor_Education_Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life .</context>

      <context> It was Dickson who suggested to Lord_Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United_States . In September 1817 at Fort_Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of Sioux , he escorted to Prairie_du_Chien . During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United_States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red_River and that the United_States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England . Upon arriving_at Baltimore , Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John_Quincy_Adams , Secretary_of_State at <head>Washington</head> , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois_Territories '' . This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at_first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements '' . The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop_into a trade_route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected . In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the Forks '' ( Fort_Douglas ) and in December 1819 , twenty men left Fort_Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie_du_Chien .</context>

Unmarried soldiers carried_on correspondence with sweethearts at home .

The Structural_Clay_Products_Institute , <head>Washington</head> , D._C. , is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction . An underground reinforced_concrete shelter can be built by a contractor for about $ 1000 to $ 1500 , depending_on the type of entrance . The shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection . The illustration ( fig. 11 ) shows this shelter with the roof at ground_level and mounded_over .</context>

      <context> Plans for the shelter , with either a stairway or hatchway entrance , are shown on pages 26 and 27 . Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction . It would add about $ 500 to the total cost of the home . The shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the <head>Washington</head> , D._C. area in the Spring of 1959 .

Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks_like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind . Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali_bees .

In the United_States Department_of_Agriculture 's Yearbook_of_Agriculture , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects , George_E._Bohart mentions a site in Utah which was estimated to contain 200000 nesting females .

      <context> The final step was a vote for a $ 230000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage_system by the 1959 town_meeting , later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special town_meeting June_21 , 1960 . There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams . Manchester 's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev._J._D._Wickham , headmaster of Burr and Burton_Seminary , was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , Samuel_F._B._Morse . At_any_rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between Baltimore and <head>Washington</head> . In 1846 Matthew_B._Goodwin , jeweler and watchmaker , became the town 's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the Equinox_House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont '' . Goodwin was telegrapher for the `` American_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Troy_and_Canada_Junction_Telegraph_Company '' .
