      <context> Teaching guides are included with each record . In an effort to fortify himself against the unforeseen upsets sure to arise in the future , Herbert_A._Leggett , banker editor of the Phoenix `` Arizona_Progress '' , reflects upon a_few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties . One of the roughest was the TV quiz shows , which gave him inferiority_complexes . Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned_out to be <head>frauds</head> and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many_another intelligent , well-informed American . But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $ 2000000 profit on the stock_market . Every man who dabbles_in the market to make a_little easy_money on_the_side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb . Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best_seller book to make some dough .</context>

      <context> Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually . You will come_up with a frightening total . That 's why the FDA , the American_Medical_Association ( AMA ) , and the National_Better_Business_Bureau ( BBB ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $ 610 million or_so paid to medical charlatans annually . The Postmaster_General recently reported that mail_order <head>frauds</head> - among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently - are at the highest level in history . Similarly , the American_Cancer_Society ( ACS ) , the Arthritis_and_Rheumatism_Foundation , and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high . For_example , the BBB has reported it was receiving four_times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as_many complaints compared with two years ago . Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come_up with is only a surface manifestation - turned_up by their inevitably limited policing - of the real loot of the medical racketeer .</context>

      <context> The medical device pirate of today , of_course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear - the gallus snapping hawker of snake_oil and other patent_medicines . His plunder is therefore far higher - running into hundreds of millions . According_to the Food_and_Drug_Administration ( FDA ) , `` Doctor '' Ghadiali , Dr._Albert_Abrams and his clique , and Dr._Wilhelm_Reich - to name three notorious device quacks - succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines . Authorities believe that many_of the Doctor <head>Frauds</head> using these false health gadgets are still in business . Look_at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland . Sarah_Gross , a dress_shop proprietor , paid $ 1020 to a masseur , and Mr._A. , a laborer , paid $ 4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines - the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' . Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually .</context>

      <context> Such was the impromptu that Voltaire gave to howls of laughter at Sans_Souci and that was soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of Europe , to be printed sometime later , but with the name of Timon_of_Athens , the famous misanthrope , substituted for that of Rousseau . How cruel ! But at_the_same_time how understandable . How could the rich , for whom life was made so simple , ever understand the subterfuges , the lies , the <head>frauds</head> , the errors , sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life ? How , for_example , could a Voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a Rousseau would find himself when , soon after the furor of his first Discourse , he acquired still another title to fame ? This time as a musician . As a composer .</context>

      <context> The whole_thing , his manner conveyed , was so far outside the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept_under_the_rug . No_doubt Mrs._Meeker had snubbed him many_a time and he felt no grief over her passing . Even_so , Madden 's dislike of the suave , correct lawyer deepened . It would be all_right with him , he decided , if his investigation of the <head>fraud</head> , with its probable by-product of murder , led to Garth 's door . Motive ? Ten-thousand-dollar bequest . At_first_glance , not much of a motive for a man of his standing ; but for all his air of affluence , who could tell what his private financial picture was ?</context>

      <context> Her friends and professional associates would sympathize_with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically . If Hal_Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way . There was no such thing as an `` accident '' . Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in_this web of elaborate <head>frauds</head> to cover_up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die . And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony . No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared . Hal felt sorry_for Mary ; he had_a_time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation_dome .</context>
