      <context> If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real_life . Dr._H._V._Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University_of_Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification . As_a_matter_of_fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr._Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day . Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new <head>evidence</head> , fully corroborated the ancient priest 's information . Dr._Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream . He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite , and imagined it must have been German or English . We may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr._Hilprecht 's subconscious reasoning .</context>

Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon .

      <context> If it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the New Protestantism ( with a_few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do . They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers . The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit '' of Protestant religious life ; in_fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal '' Roman_Catholic parish . We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; actually , there is little <head>evidence</head> of such personal community in Protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection . The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members . The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations .</context>

The chief literary antecedents of the Snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated_in the South and the Southwest in the three decades before the Civil_War .

Besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in_addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years . It is more difficult with Faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge . His own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the South , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation .</context>

      <context> To believe otherwise would be unrealistic . But in looking_at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the South , it is important not to lose the broader perspective . His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers . <head>Evidence</head> is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic_romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in_particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry_James and James_Joyce among them . His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him . My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked_at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by_no_means new with him , and most_of the problems he takes_up have had the attention of authors before him .</context>

The student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at_the_same_time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another .

Interesting <head>evidence</head> can be found in the results of the Chamber_of_Commerce elections , which took_place three weeks before national elections . The Istiqlal sponsored U.M.C.I.A.

The bulk of the preparation had , of_course , proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry_of_the_Interior , whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics .

      <context> Since marginal_costs rise when the wage rate rises , the profit_maximizing price also rises when the public limit price is elevated , and is likely to remain well above the latter . The entry limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic competition , but unless general inflation permits profit_margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy , we might expect the public limit price to approach the entry limit price . The foreign entry limit price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage rates do not enter foreign costs directly . Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as <head>evidence</head> of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure . Whether or not it is in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends_upon the extent to which the public limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase . The extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase . We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put_up by the industry .</context>

The force of the authors ' analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , I believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered .
