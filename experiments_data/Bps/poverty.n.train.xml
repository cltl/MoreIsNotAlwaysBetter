      <context> He walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns . Landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly '' but he was , in_fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath . He was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld , the roughneck king . O_'_Banion was born in <head>poverty</head> , the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer , in the North_Side 's Little_Hell , close by the Sicilian quarter and Death_Corner . He had been a choir_boy at the Holy_Name_Cathedral and also served as an acolyte to Father_O_'_Brien . The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy_houses , honkytonks , and sawdust_saloons of his birthplace ; he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went_through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police dodging , and housebreaking . At the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the Loop , he was knocked_down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg .</context>

      <context> Such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ; nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters . One of the early humorists already mentioned , Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials . Thorpe came to Louisiana from the East as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty . But Thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural <head>poverty</head> of the frontier_settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions . As a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on_the_one_hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on_the_other an anecdote of the village of Hardscrabble , Arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano ; and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor , `` The_Big_Bear_of_Arkansas '' , in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature .</context>

      <context> He thought how this dainty , fragile older woman threading her way through the streets of Westminster on a day in June , enjoying the flowers in the shops , the greetings from old friends , but never really drawing a deep , passionate breath , was so like himself . He , and Mrs._Dalloway , too , had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug_into the bone_marrow of the spirit . He had not because he was both poor and ambitious . <head>Poverty</head> imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious . They cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars along a dark country lane . No , they must look_the_other_way and climb one more painful step up the ladder . He made the decision with his eyes open , or so he thought .</context>

The Vice_President said , `` If you hear of any names that would fix_me_cheap in_return_for advertising they decorated the Vice_President 's home , let me know . I can do business with that kind '' . Again , Lawrence thought a_little sadly , these were the fees of <head>poverty</head> and ambition . Boxell did not have the chance to grow_up graciously . He had to acquire everything he was going_to get in four years . They had brandy in the library .</context>

      <context> But Sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly : `` Let 's go and see what it_'s like '' . Annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham , near the Georgia border and on the Tallahoosa_River , a small and dirty stream . The city was a center of manufacture , especially in textiles , and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings , a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama . But it had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black_Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived - servants and laborers huddled_together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much <head>poverty</head> and crime . Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city over ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were . Beyond were industries and factories . Then they went_down to Black_Bottom .</context>
