      <context> Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal_year next Aug. 31 . He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on_the_books `` since Texas was a republic '' . It permits the state to take_over bank_accounts , stocks and other personal_property of persons missing for seven years or more . The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force <head>banks</head> , insurance_firms , pipeline_companies and other corporations to report such property to the state_treasurer . The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . Dewey_Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas_Bankers_Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . `` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said .</context>

      <context> SBA loans , which may be made to small manufacturers , small business pools , wholesalers , retailers , service establishments and other small businesses ( when financing is not otherwise available to them on reasonable terms ) , are to finance business construction , conversion , or expansion ; the purchase of equipment , facilities , machinery , supplies , or materials ; or to supply working_capital . Evidence that other sources of financing are unavailable must be provided . SBA business loans are of two types : `` participation '' and `` direct '' . Participation_loans are those made jointly by the SBA and <head>banks</head> or other private lending_institutions . Direct_loans are those made by SBA alone . To qualify for either type of loan , an applicant must be a small business or approved small business `` pool '' and must meet certain credit requirements . A small business is defined as one which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field .</context>

      <context> As they were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two bluffs , a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers . Not a bullet touched Cook who was nearer the ambush , but one hit Russell in the leg and another broke his arm , passing_on through his body . With the first reports , Russell 's horse wheeled to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook , followed by a hail of bullets , raced towards the arroyo of Salyer_'s_Canyon immediately in_front_of him , just reaching it as his horse fell . Grabbing his Winchester from its sheath , Cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo <head>bank</head> . Bullets were so thick , throwing sand in his face , that he found it difficult to return the fire . Noticing Russell 's horse in_front_of the long log building , he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put_up a good fight , so he began working his way down the ditch to join him .

In November 1900 surveying was done under John_Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power_plant . Nothing came of it , perhaps due_to lack of opportunity for water storage . The next step was construction by the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company of a plant on the west <head>bank</head> of the Battenkill south of Union_Street bridge . This was nearly completed May 23 , 1901 with a promise of lights by June 10 , but the first light did not go_on until September 28 .

      <context> At_any_rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington . In 1846 Matthew_B._Goodwin , jeweler and watchmaker , became the town 's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the Equinox_House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont '' . Goodwin was telegrapher for the `` American_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Troy_and_Canada_Junction_Telegraph_Company '' . Shares of capital_stock at $ 15 each in the latter company were payable at the Bank_of_Manchester or at various other Vermont <head>banks</head> . A message of less_than fifteen words to Bennington cost twenty-five cents . By 1871 L._C._Orvis , manager of the `` Western_Union_Telegraph_Company '' , expressed willingness to send emergency telegrams on Sundays from his Village drugstore .

Department_stores congregated in the `` one_hundred per_cent location '' , where all the transit_lines converged . These stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more_and_more dry_goods .
