      <context> There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed . If the temperature is controlled properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until needed . And unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado . It is thick , much like an egg_plant 's skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the <head>consumer</head> . Good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited . Avocados , however , are very rich_in nutrients . Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty_acids , so necessary for maintaining the good_health of the circulatory_system .</context>

      <context> From the manufacturer 's point_of_view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties . It is accentuated by the need for pre selling goods , and private label competition . How much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? Are you following competition willy-nilly - trying to match dollar for dollar - or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing <head>consumers</head> ? Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program - from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon . Will you be out in the market_place with some of these sales building new products ?</context>

      <context> Based on our experience with clients , we see 14 major problems which fall_into three broad groups - the market_place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management . There has been an intensification of price consciousness in recent years ; there is every indication it will continue . Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers . Despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before - traveling back along the chain from <head>consumer</head> to distributor to manufacturer . Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : Has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ?</context>

      <context> Many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one . Proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization , and your distributor organizations , not_only in the techniques but also in good customer relations . Have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ? In spending his money today , the <head>consumer</head> is pulled in many directions . To the manufacturer of the more convenient type product - the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put_off entirely - the implications are important . Your competition is now proportionately greater - you are competing not_only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products . Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer 's dollar being spent on their particular products .</context>

      <context> The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys . The motivations for both sexes , to_be_sure , are different . The vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while Jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed . One of the significant developments in American Jewish life is that the cultural <head>consumers</head> are largely the women . It is they who read - and make - Jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them . In upper teen Jewish life , the non college group tends to have a sense of marginality . `` People automatically assume that I 'm in college '' , a nineteen year old machinist observed irritably .</context>

      <context> This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment . More_than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples . Since American life is committed above_all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis . <head>Consumer</head> communities have suffered at_the_hands_of the productive interests . Negroes , Puerto_Ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities . Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century . The identification of the basic unit of religious organization - the parish or congregation - with a residential area is self_defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron_trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation .</context>
