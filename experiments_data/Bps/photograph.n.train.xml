      <context> Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone_poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 's . However well_chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening 's main business , which ( considering the talent at_hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style . Another source of NBC pride was its rare film_clip of Bix_Beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew_by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted_out the entire glimpse . Similarly , in presenting still <head>photographs</head> of early jazz_groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal . `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' may have wound_up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer . By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today 's artists , the program turned_out to be a not quite perfect example of either . Still , the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated .</context>

      <context> Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor 's office showing ownerships of land . Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation . This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons . It is usually helpful to make a sketch_map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take <head>photographs</head> at the site . These are a great aid for planning use back at the office . For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry_through the study . However , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation .</context>

      <context> But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable . Consultation with architects , clients , real_estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work . Fortunately , although only a_few years ago they held the student at_arms_length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not_only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior_designer of tomorrow - that the student already is `` in the trade '' . Even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from <head>photographs</head> and lantern_slides . Here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced . The professional organizations such_as American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers , National_Society_of_Interior_Designers , Home_Fashions_League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work . Certainly every educator involved in interior_design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations .</context>

      <context> So is the time of the novel . The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know . The time of the motion_picture is fixed absolutely . The film consists_of a series of still , transparent <head>photographs</head> , or `` frames '' , 35 - mm. - wide . Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent_movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second . This is the rate of projection ; it is also the rate of photographing . Time is built into the motion_picture , which cannot exist without time .</context>

      <context> This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason . If a is the major_axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes , the radius_of_curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis is * * f , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axes is * * f . There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas . However , there are <head>photographs</head> of suspended drops of cyclohexanol_phthalate ( viscosity 155 poises ) suspended in corn_syrup of 71 poises in a paper by Mason and Bartok . This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of_course , not negligible . Measurements on the photograph in this paper give * * f at the maximum rate of shear of * * f . If it is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of * * f , cosec 2lc applies , the pressure difference along the major_axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major_axis , and from this the interfacial_tension can be calculated .</context>

      <context> Eugene was not entirely silent , or openly rude - unless asking Harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act of rudeness . It went right on creaking under his own considerable weight , and all it needed , Harold thought , was for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of_it .

Harold indicated the <head>photograph</head> on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was in . Eugene told him and he promptly forgot .
