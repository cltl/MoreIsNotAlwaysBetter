      <context> Complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet_planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays London 's new technique to the best effect . All_of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program . No reference is made to the possibility of recording other_than popular_music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious_music . Directionality is greatly exaggerated most_of the <head>time</head> ; but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music . You definitely hear some of the instruments close_up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back . This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound . London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels .</context>

      <context> This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound . London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels . These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record . In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different <head>times</head> and then later combined on the master tape to produce special_effects . Some clue to the character of London 's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion '' or `` percussive '' . Drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive_instruments are reproduced remarkably well . Only_too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined_up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right .</context>

      <context> As_a_matter_of_fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results . A_few years ago a `` Timex All Star Jazz Show '' offered a broad range of styles , ranging from Lionel_Hampton 's big_band to the free-wheeling Dukes_of_Dixieland . An enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live '' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance . About that same <head>time</head> John_Crosby 's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing_space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do . In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods . The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music . Cameras stared at soloists ' faces in extreme closeups , then considerately pulled_back for full views of ensemble work .</context>

      <context> Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone_poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 's . However well_chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening 's main business , which ( considering the talent at_hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style . Another source of NBC pride was its rare film_clip of Bix_Beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew_by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted_out the entire glimpse . Similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz_groups , the program allowed no <head>time</head> for a close perusal . `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' may have wound_up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer . By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today 's artists , the program turned_out to be a not quite perfect example of either . Still , the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated .</context>

      <context> The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit_world of the entities which previously populated it . In carrying_out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit . The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support . Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and <head>time</head> . When , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality . In doing so science has unquestionably cleared_up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions . There have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful .</context>

      <context> Aside_from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community . The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age . There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people . Instead , the audience can sit_back at_ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened <head>time</head> which no_longer believes_in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion . A teenage girl , Abigail_Williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the Reverend_Samuel_Parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings . For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air . As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .</context>

According_to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church_of_England , the `` total of confirmed members is 9748000 , but only 2887671 are registered on the parochial church_rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church_of_England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' .

In all his miscalculations , Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers ' inspirations - representing many peoples , time_periods and styles - into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments . Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations - his brilliant Petruchka , his savage Sacre_du_Printemps , his incisive Les_Noces - the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed . But <head>time</head> is running_out , and many_of Stravinsky 's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra_firma . His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a_house_divided_against_itself : Supra_Expressionism , Neo Paganism , Neo_Classicism , Neo_Romanticism , Neo_Jazz , Neo Ecclesiasticism , Neo Popularism , and most_recently , Post Serialism - all competing with each other within one composer ! What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist ; a maladroit reharmonization of our National_Anthem ( The Star-Spangled_Banner ) ; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ; a circus polka for elephants ; his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs !</context>

Of_course , it must_not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him ; <head>time</head> and economic security ; symphony_orchestras , opera and ballet_companies ; choruses , chamber_music ensembles ; soloists ; recordings ; broadcastings ; television ; large and eager audiences .

As shown in Fig. 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 <head>times</head> a second with short 400 - kc. bursts . The energy received by the `` pill '' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ringing '' takes_place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' .

One of the advantages of_this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions .</context>

Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality .

As <head>time</head> has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military_vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range and breadth of message sending has increased .

      <context> Great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network . By monitoring , we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers . As a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types , question , command , statement , or exclamation . For_example , suppose a man wearing a $ 200 watch , driving a 1959 Rolls_Royce , stops to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` What <head>time</head> is it '' ? This sentence would have most_of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car . If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation . Also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command .</context>

The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting_as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village . The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( a ) One man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too_much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc. . ( b ) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive <head>times</head> . ( c ) Decisions of a general kind are made by the central command . And ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower_rank .

There is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our <head>time</head> . In B._M._Spinley 's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience .

Our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries . Very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or `` belongs_to '' some way of thought labelled as a `` school '' or an `` - ism '' , i._e. a complex or `` syndrome '' of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification .

      <context> However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the <head>time</head> of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' . 353_U._S._,_at_589 .

      <context> Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du_Pont and General_Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute . We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the <head>time</head> of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints . The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition '' . 353_U._S._,_at_607 .

This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons_systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_systems which have been overtaken by events . Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the <head>time</head> their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated . For_example , the importance of the Regulus_2 , , a very promising aerodynamic ship to surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic_missile launched by submerged submarines . Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long range interceptor with a speed three_times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid 1960 's .

This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 ) . Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 a , b , c ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 ) .

The observable characteristics of planetary radio_radiation are the intensity , the polarization , and the direction of arrival of the waves . The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute_of_arc .

Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure . Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built_up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate . A system had_to be used which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable <head>time</head> .

As an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion . It is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group . A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage .</context>

      <context> The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 ) . Whether this abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH , or is , alternatively , normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible_for the blood activity with pituitary TSH . In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them . The introduction of the United_States_Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid stimulating activity have made_it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that <head>time</head> . We should_like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in_terms_of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units . For_the_most_part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard . The international unit ( u . ) , adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different laboratories ( Mussett and Perry , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the International_Standard_Preparation .</context>

      <context> According_to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit . The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem . Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the <head>time</head> the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced . The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination .

      <context> When an evaluative situation is set_up , and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate , we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation . Observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion . This behavior is more `` veridical '' - or true than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning . While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present <head>time</head> , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure . The objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts .

      <context> The president of the firm , calculating expenses alone , felt his costs had dropped one-half while success in selection had improved over one_hundred per_cent . The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers . They were , in_a_sense , `` tried_out '' in realistic situations . From the point_of_view of the applicants , less <head>time</head> was wasted in being evaluated - and they got a meal out of it as_well_as some insights into their performances . Another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real_life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work .

      <context> One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . Eventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior - which , as_usual , went_on without any accompanying words from her - she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny '' ?

At another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother introject began to emerge more_and_more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' ! I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; but a_few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you '' !

      <context> Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome . I have found , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior . For_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got_up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the end of each session . Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each <head>time</head> , that the healing Christ would be stooping_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met . This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard_to the wishes of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy_chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair - in_short , behaving as if I owned her room .

Each dictionary form is looked_up in the text form list by the same method used to look_up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading . A random address * * f that lies within the X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary form . If cell * * f is an information cell , it and any information cells in the Y-region that have been linked to * * f each contain an address in the W-region where a potentially matching form is stored .</context>

      <context> The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents . Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at_once . An extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatic description of each form . Equivalents could be assigned to the paradigm either at the <head>time</head> it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context . Thus , one can think_of a dictionary_entry as a word rather than a form . If all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible . For_example , the inflected forms of a word can be represented , insofar as regular inflection allows , by a stem and a set of endings to be attached .</context>

      <context> Similarly , if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary , the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form .

Until the Charter_of_Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes .

      <context> The foreign entry limit price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage rates do not enter foreign costs directly . Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure . Whether or not it is in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends_upon the extent to which the public limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase . The extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of <head>time</head> , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase . We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put_up by the industry . The industry may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in_order to `` educate '' the government and the customers of the industry .

When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit - when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands - two purposes were served : Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law became a rational system for implementing that will , for serving conscious goals , for embodying the `` public policy '' .</context>

Telegraphers at the Depot at this <head>time</head> were Aaron_C._Burr and Mark_Manley of `` Burr_and_Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry_goods . Early equipment was very flimsy ; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles , making communications impossible . But companies continued to spring_up .

      <context> in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes , in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes . The apostolic community was literally an elite : chosen by Christ himself . And the monastic communities were supposed to be made_up of volunteers selected only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigors , their spiritual athleticism . Finally , the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More 's <head>time</head> , although it was not accepted by all the theologian philosophers of the Middle_Ages . In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the Fall of Man . It did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order , because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had sinned . The actual function of patristic civilian canonist scholastic communism was adequately set_forth by St._Gregory almost a millennium before More wrote Utopia .</context>

It was not even in writing Latin epigrams , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics , or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus 's philological study of the New_Testament . Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century . Had More 's writings been wholly limited to such exercises , they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or_so other authors living in his <head>time</head> , whose works tenuously survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works . More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone - because he wrote Utopia . And the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or_so . Only one other contemporary of More 's evokes so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work - Niccolo_Machiavelli and The_Prince .</context>

The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history . While the Daily_Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily_Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket_Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men .

It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no_one had <head>time</head> to spend sympathizing_with poor Isaac - except the Reverend . I know that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket_ball , as Isaac had been , yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself . I was drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from the road , and the fact that I was not afraid now , but only waiting to know what to do next . Meanwhile , I reloaded my gun , as the other men were doing .</context>

It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays ; for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten feet away from me , was the sharp definition of what my reality had become . And now the redcoats were coming , and the gunfire was a part of the dust_cloud on the road to the west of us . I must state that the faster things happened , the slower they happened ; the passage and rhythm of <head>time</head> changed , and when I remember back to what happened then , each event is a separate and frozen incident .

Yet it could not have been more than a matter of seconds , and then the front of the British army came into view .

      <context> There was the suggestion of ice_water , and - in_spite of the protest `` We 're not really thirsty '' - Linda_Kay , to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices , hurried to the kitchen . She filled a big pitcher and set it , with glasses , on a tray . Carrying it to the living_room , she imagined the picture she made : tall and roundly slim , a_bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath , with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band . Almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain , at such a <head>time</head> , in such a place , and she tossed_back her long yellow hair , smiling shyly as she entered the room . Howard ( the thick middle-aged man ) was looking at her .

      <context> Linda_Kay felt_like going_off to the bedroom to cry ; but they were going_up to the Big_House after supper , and she had_to put_on a clean dress and fix her hair a_little .

They all sat around and drank ice_water , and the men smoked , and everybody had a good <head>time</head> . Once_in_a_while they said what a shame it was , with Granny dying , but they all agreed she would n't have wanted it any other way . That night the older men got_to talking_about going possum hunting on a moonlight night . Bobby_Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum hunting , and Uncle_Bill_Farnworth ( from Mama_Albright 's side of the family ) said he would just get_up from there and take them , right then .</context>

      <context> Thus a new pattern of days began to develop , for Granny_Albright did not die . She lay still on the bed , her head hardly denting the pillow ; sometimes she opened her eyes and looked_around , and sometimes she took a_little milk or soup . They stopped expecting her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two . Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go_home , for she might die any <head>time</head> ; but they might as_well unpack their suitcases , for she might linger on . So the pattern was established . When Linda_Kay had put_up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs , she would go_to the Big_House . There was not anything she could do there , but that was where everyone was , or would be .</context>

And it is thought by many who think_about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet , progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso , and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De_Kooning . Quasimodo defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' . `` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to Franz_Kline and myself , `` the nothing that_is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non <head>time</head> '' . It is his relentlessness and unwavering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` The_Invasion_of_Cuba '' . In this work , his use of non color is startling and skillful . The sweep of space , the delicate counterbalance of the white masses , the over-all completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece .</context>

The next <head>time</head> we saw him , he was a changed person ; he had aged thirty years , and his face , the color of tallow , was crisscrossed with wrinkles , as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire . Some sort_of nemesis was haunting his footsteps , he told us in a quavering voice - either an ape specter or Abe_Spector , a process_server , we could n't determine which . His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr._Grimesby_Roylott 's when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band . The grocery the youth worked for soon tired_of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go .</context>

      <context> However one looks_at it , therefore , I 'd say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy . The inventory you acquired from me is n't going_to be easy to move ; you can't very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva . Additionally , since you 're going_to be hors_de_combat pretty soon with sprue , yaws , Delhi_boil , the Granville_wilt , liver_fluke , bilharziasis , and a host of other complications of the hex you 've aroused , you must n't expect to be lionized socially . My advice , if you live long enough to continue your vocation , is that the next <head>time</head> you 're attracted by the exotic , pass it up - it 's nothing but a headache . As you can count_on me to do the same . compassionately yours , S._J._Perelman .</context>
