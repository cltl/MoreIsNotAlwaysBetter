      <context> The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver 's Al_Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave_Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al_Reynolds claimed it for Dallas . A quick touchdown resulted . `` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right_away '' , said Stram , quipping , `` I think I 'll put that play in the book '' . The early Southwest_Conference football <head>leaders</head> - Texas , Arkansas and Texas_A+M - made a big dent in the statistics last week . Texas ' 545 - yard spree against Washington_State gave the Longhorns a 3 - game total offense of 1512 yards ( 1065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high . Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A+M , with a 38 - point bulge against Texas_Tech ran_up its biggest total loop play since 1950 . Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards .</context>

      <context> Thus , in `` The_Story_of_Ruth '' we have Ruth , Naomi , and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic . But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline - i.e. , that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound_up with Boaz - the film version has little to do with the Bible . And in the new `` King_of_Kings '' the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the Gospels . Earlier this month Edward_R._Murrow , director of the United_States_Information_Agency , came to Hollywood and had dinner with more_than 100 <head>leaders</head> of the motion_picture industry . He talked_about unauthentic storylines too . He intimated that they were n't doing the country much good in the Cold_War . And to an industry that prides itself on authenticity , he urged greater realism .</context>

      <context> But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational <head>leaders</head> have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach . In 1959 SAAMI 's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports . This program is now nationally known_as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' .</context>

      <context> SAAMI 's field men have served as consultants and / or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40000 enthusiastic young Americans . Through the efforts of SAAMI 's shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a_few . The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many_of our political , social , educational and even religious <head>leaders</head> too often forget it . Help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level . The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association . Since SAAMI 's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone_into the development of more places to_shoot for more youths and adults .</context>

      <context> He is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often - since private affairs rarely remain private - to the outside world as_well . `` A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband 's maleness '' , declares Dr._Calderone . This opinion is supported by one of the nation 's leading psychiatrists , Dr._Maurice_E._Linden , director of the Mental_Health_Division of the Philadelphia_Department_of_Public_Health . `` When the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes <head>leader</head> and the husband follower '' , Dr._Linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' . In one extreme case , cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker 's wife refused to have sexual_relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded . To win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer . Caught at_last , he was sentenced to prison .</context>

On the second voyage , he had turned_back at the frozen island of Novaya_Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free_will - which was obviously not the case .

Landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly '' but he was , in_fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath . He was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob <head>leader</head> in the Chicago underworld , the roughneck king .

The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy_houses , honkytonks , and sawdust_saloons of his birthplace ; he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went_through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police dodging , and housebreaking .</context>

      <context> Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead rigid and inflexible in their policies . American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes . It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies . We have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their <head>leaders</head> in frank but friendly ways . We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period_of_time . With the exception of treaty making , foreign relations were historically concerned for_the_most_part with conditions of short or at_least measurable duration . Foreign_policy now takes_on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection .</context>

Above_all , we should seek to encourage the <head>leaders</head> of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible_for their fates .
