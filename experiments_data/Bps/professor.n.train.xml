      <context> One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken_place since the mid 19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge_Universities . At Oxford one_hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 . Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs . Now , not_only are there considerably more laity as students and <head>professors</head> at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious_orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non_Catholic members of the University . Some Catholic priests lecture there ; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students . Further evidence that Roman_Catholicism enjoys a more favorable_position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to_it in the mass_media of England . The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester_Guardian and the Sunday_Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic_Church is now at_least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches .</context>

      <context> The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral rib_cage stretcher ever invented ! This is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved . You 'll know when you 've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder_blades will touch ! As you see , the <head>professor</head> has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a wide grip . He has to ; he just can n't do anything about it at_all ! But as you can also see , it 's not a painful exercise at_all , because Henri_de_Courcy - the `` happy '' bodybuilder - looks as though he were having the time of his life ! The last exercise of Roland_Claude 's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a_bit longer pause between sets .</context>

      <context> Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments . Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority , Professor_Roland_Claude . And they could n't have entrusted Henri to better hands because `` le_professeur '' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido_mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis_anticus of the leg - and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth . That 's because the good <head>professor</head> teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal_Health_Studio which is located at 1821 Mt._Royal_East in Montreal . Undoubtedly you have read the case_histories of some of his prize_winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) . There 's Gaetan_d'Amours who is our newest Mr._Canada ; Jean-Paul_Senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago ; Jack_Boissoneault , who was with us last month ; Charles_Harve , who recently won the `` Most Muscular Man '' subdivision award in the Mr._Canada event ; and a host of others .

Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4 ' 10 '' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack_on some weight . About that time he began reading Mr._America and Muscle_Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight_gaining . Seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein , those two wonder-working Weider food supplements , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him .</context>

      <context> `` It never seemed to widen , it just got longer and longer '' . That 's when he went_to Professor_Claude . And at_once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it . In his gym the <head>professor</head> has some of the most `` knocked_out '' equipment since Vic_Tanny . Mr._Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now famous Weider_Push-Pull_Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . So right_away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull_Super-Set consisting_of the wide grip Straight-Arm_Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull_Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib_cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar Bench_Press which specifically works_on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids . As you can see , in this Push-Pull_Super_Set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises , so the complete torso remains pumped-up all_the_time !</context>

Super-Set No. 2 is made_up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat_benches . The `` push '' exercise of this Push-Pull_Super-Set is the Bench_Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation . You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs .</context>

      <context> Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not_only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it . In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university 's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist . However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals . In 1806 his ambition was realized and he became <head>professor</head> of physics at the Copenhagen_University , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 . During Oersted 's attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences . He was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof._J._G._L._Manthey ( 1769 - 1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in_addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` Lion_Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him . Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted 's disposal during and after his graduation .</context>

      <context> In the following year , 1803 , Oersted , simultaneously with Davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic_battery more_than did salts . Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded_down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' . He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood . The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of <head>professor</head> represented the upper social level . His broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him . His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong . The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek_out the philosophers as he had on his first journey .</context>

      <context> Participation for the educator in this case , however , would have_to be raised to full and complete membership . The largest of these organizations at_present denies to the full_time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog . This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students . The <head>professor</head> in_turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice . This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands . In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools . That_is in the continuance of the `` grandfather_clauses '' in their membership requirements .</context>

      <context> In all `` degree '' courses in interior_design a number of `` academic '' or `` general studies '' courses are included . It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and_so_on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior_design , as are the art_teachers educated in the academic subjects . The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only_if this standard is observed . The matter of sympathy of the academic <head>professors</head> for art objectives also must be taken_into_account . One technical question of school organization comes_to_mind here . For proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at_least one level above that for which the student is a candidate . Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior_design this rule cannot at_present be observed .</context>

      <context> Indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at_all . The question , however , cannot be ignored for long . The basic problem involved is that a college setting_up a graduate_school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree . Most <head>professors</head> in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers . One solution is the acquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute . It is a sort_of academic ring-around-a_rosy and you solve it . This brings us to the question of accreditation of art_schools in_general .</context>

      <context> But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , <head>professors</head> , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach . In 1959 SAAMI 's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports . This program is now nationally known_as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' .</context>

      <context> Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions . When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep . If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real_life . Dr._H._V._Hilprecht , <head>Professor</head> of Assyrian at the University_of_Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification . As_a_matter_of_fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr._Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day . Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest 's information . Dr._Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream .</context>

      <context> We may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr._Hilprecht 's subconscious reasoning . But , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? Which theory is more fantastic : 1 . that the perfect continuity was composed from the job_lot of memory impressions in the <head>professor</head> 's brain , or 2 . that the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met ? The degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja_vu feeling . No_doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper 's mind .</context>

      <context> That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant . As_long_as his material is Americana , can in_some_way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied . From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth century American folklore . On the one side we have the university <head>professors</head> and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought_out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make_up this nation . On the other we have the flag_wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways . After_all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates .</context>

By her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that Papa and Mamma gave her a Life_of_Dickens as a spur to her aspiration . Another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of Johns_Hopkins_University within walking distance of home . It was established in a_couple_of buildings in the shopping district , with only a_few <head>professors</head> , but all eminent men , and a_few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings . In September ' 76 Thomas_Huxley , Darwin 's famous disciple , came from England to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the University ; and although it was a school for men only , it afforded Henrietta an opportunity to attend its public_lectures . In the following year her father undertook to give a course in Hebrew theology to Johns_Hopkins students , and this brought to the Szold house a group of bright young Jews who had come to Baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma and entertained by Henrietta and Rachel , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting_room on Sunday evenings .

      <context> More believed that a man could be both serious and gay . That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all_too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of . Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ_Church and Regius_Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant <head>Professor</head> of Medieval and Renaissance_English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . But to return to the main line of our inquiry . It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr . Utopia is still widely read because in_a_sense More stood on the margin of modernity .</context>
