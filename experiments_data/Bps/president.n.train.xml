      <context> State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called_for yesterday in a report of a `` blue_ribbon '' citizens_committee on the aid to dependent children program . The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New_York_City welfare consulting_firm , listed 10 long_range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case_load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C._Virgil_Martin , <head>president</head> of Carson_Pirie_Scott_+_Co. , committee chairman . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend_upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' .</context>

      <context> Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully - and with some imagination ? In your sales_force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make_out better with a larger number of lower paid salesmen ? Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in_return_for some benefit they can share ? In one company covering the country with a high quality sales_force of 10 men , the <head>president</head> personally phones each major account every 6 mos. . As a result , distribution_costs were cut , customer relations improved . Distribution_costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties - and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job . From the manufacturer 's point_of_view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties .</context>

      <context> However , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual . And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership . This is not due_to any policy of discrimination on_the_part_of the Northern universities . Quite the contrary , as I can testify from personal experience as a former university <head>president</head> . Rather we see here another vicious_circle . The absence of successful Negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp_down enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers . I believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need_to be heavily publicized .</context>

      <context> I am naive , they say , to make use of such words . I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? - liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as_well_as democratic processes may have to yield before it . This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a <head>President</head> of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme_Court . As for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms . The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one . Why , in_the_first_place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ?</context>

      <context> I will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year . The earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise , sponsored by Life magazine , under the title of the National purpose . The contributors to this testament were all well-known : a former Democratic candidate for <head>President</head> , a New_Deal poet , the magazine 's chief editorial writer , two newspaper_columnists , head of a national broadcasting_company , a popular Protestant evangelist , etc. . What I want to point_out here is that all_of them are ex liberals , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception . I suppose we might classify Billy_Graham as an old liberal .

      <context> There is evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William_Gilmore_Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such_as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him . Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus_Baldwin_Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university <head>president</head> in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy_Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him . Others who wrote_of low characters and low life included Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , creator of the Big_Bear of Arkansas and Tom_Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson_Jones_Hooper , whose character Simon_Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem_Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried_out his will ; and George_Washington_Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut_Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner 's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a_hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner 's time . Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long established literary precedent .</context>

      <context> This is an important consideration . If we sit here reading editorials and looking at public_opinion_polls and other reports that cross our desks , we should realize that this is raw , undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership .

We cannot test public_opinion until the <head>President</head> and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action . I doubt , for_example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk_about what came to be the Marshall_plan , any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals .

A fellow came_up_to me , a Senator , I do n't have_to tell you his name , and he told me , ' I love the <head>President</head> like a brother , but God_damn_it , he 's crucifying me . I 've got a quarter of a_million Germans in my state , and those krautheads tune_in on Father_Werther every_night , and if he tells them to go_out and piss in the public_square , that 's what they do . He 's telling them now to write letters to their Congressmen opposing the disarmament of Germany ' . And another one comes to me and he says , ' Look_here , there 's a mill in my state employs five thousand people making uniforms for the Navy .</context>

      <context> She was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash , and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury . This meant sorting_out press_clippings and the_like . Jane sat receptive and interested . Mickie had a pleasant glow as he said , `` You see , both of them , I mean the <head>President</head> and Jeff_Lawrence , are romantics . A romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and all he has_to do is find the right key , and then divine justice and altruism will appear . It 's like focusing a camera ; the distant ship is n't there until you get the focus . You know what I'm talking_about .</context>

      <context> Driving along the caliche-topped road to town , Howard talked . Finally he said , `` Tell me about yourself '' , and Linda_Kay told him , because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life . She was such a well-rounded teenager , having been a twirler , Future_Farmers sweetheart , and secretary of Future_Homemakers . In her sophomore year she had started going_steady with Bobby_Joe , who was a football_player , Future_Homemakers sweetheart , and <head>president</head> of Future_Farmers . It was easy to see that they were made_for each other , and they knew what they wanted . Bobby_Joe would be a senior this year , and he planned to graduate . But there was no need for Linda_Kay to go_on , since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby_Joe and ( blushing ) raise his children .</context>
