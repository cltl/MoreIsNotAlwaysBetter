The former county school_superintendent , George_P._Callan , shot himself to death <head>March</head> 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school_board . During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone_calls .

Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election .</context>

      <context> An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State_Affairs_Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . Rep._Wesley_Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West_Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman_Bill_Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before <head>March</head> 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice .

      <context> Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury . He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 . His statistical record that year , when Texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards . He went_into the Army in <head>March</head> , 1957 , and returned two years later . But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season . Place_kicking is largely a matter of timing , Moritz declared . `` Once you get the feel of it , there 's not much to it .</context>

      <context> By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , Roy_Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art . Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all . The artist was_born in Gilbert_Mills , New_York , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California , he lived in western New_York , in Batavia . When I looked_up the actual date of his birth and found it to be <head>March</head> 15_th , I realized that Roy was_born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist : the water sign of Pisces ( February 18 - March 20 ) . And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in American_Artist again , in his natal month of March ! Over the years , beginning in 1929 , Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals ; two Ranger_Fund_purchase_awards ; the Joseph_Pennell_Memorial_Medal ; two American_Watercolor_Society_prizes ; the Blair_Purchase_Prize for watercolor , Art_Institute of Chicago ; and_others in Buffalo , New_York , Chautauqua , New_Haven , Rochester , Rockport , and most_recently , the $ 300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna_Beach_Art_Association ,</context>

      <context> In 1930 , the Lambeth_Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate . In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth_control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere . Many other Protestant_denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action . In <head>March</head> , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the Federal_Council_of_Churches ratified artificial methods of birth_control . `` As_to the necessity '' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question . There is general_agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual_affection without relation_to procreation is right '' . Since then , many Protestant_denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not_only approved birth_control , but declared it at_times to be a religious duty .</context>

      <context> The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or_else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery . The image of God has simply disappeared . All such imitations of negative quality have given_rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at_least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak_to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved . The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the <head>march</head> of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems . Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually_exclusive , that they belong together . Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being . And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written .</context>

      <context> All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks . Even the officer in_charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is restrained by monitoring . This is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility . The commands are specified by the military regulations ; are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound ; and are combinable into sequences which permit any <head>marching</head> maneuver that could be desired on a parade_ground . This monitoring is necessary because , on a parade_ground , everyone can hear too_much , and without monitoring a confused social_event would develop . With troops dispersed on fields_of_battle rather than on the parade_ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication . Years ago this was true , but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too_much is heard .</context>

      <context> A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more_than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region . Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present . The results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1000 to 10000 * * f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from * * f to * * f times normal density . In <head>March</head> , 1961 , representatives of the national laboratories of Australia , Canada , The_Netherlands , United_Kingdom , U._S._S._R. , United_States , and West_Germany , met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 * * f . As a first_step toward this goal , arrangements were worked_out for comparing the scales now in_use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance_thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory . Such a group of thermometers was obtained and calibrated at the NBS . These thermometers have now been sent to the United_Kingdom for calibration at the National_Physical_Laboratory .</context>

      <context> He was again reclassified 1_,_-_A by the local board . There followed a customary Department_of_Justice hearing , at which petitioner appeared . In his report to the Attorney_General , the hearing_officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service . On <head>March</head> 21 , 1957 , however , the Department recommended approval of the 1_,_-_A classification . Its ground for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date ) , that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the Jehovah's_Witnesses reported that he was no_longer doing so and , on_the_contrary , had relinquished both his Pioneer_and_Bible_Student_Servant positions . It reported that he now devoted only some 6 - 1_2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities . His claim was therefore `` so highly exaggerated '' , the Department concluded , that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and , consequently , upon his sincerity and good_faith '' .</context>

      <context> I must add at_once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold_weather . Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in <head>March</head> or April , when the temperature is close to 50 ` F and there is not too_much wind . Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a_couple_of those wonderful flowering currants such_as the red Ribes_sanguineum of our Pacific_Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy_willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins .

      <context> However , as so many of the records are not certainly based on newborn snakes , these data must be taken tentatively ; final conclusions will have_to await the measurements of broods from definite localities . Alphonse_R_._Hoge 's measurements of several very young specimens from Brazil suggest that at_birth the female is slightly larger than the male . I have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity . Carl_Kauffeld has written to me of sexual_activity in February 1943 of young born in <head>March</head> 1940 . One female , collected on an island off the coast of Nicaragua , was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from snout to vent ( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long ) . The female from Central_America which gave_birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long . What data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; unfortunately , no_one has kept complete records of one individual , whereas many have been made for a very short period_of_time .</context>

      <context> In proportion as meanings are concrete , we can better rely_on their being insulated and distinctive . An elephant or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious , common-sense , indubitable identity , as do an eye or tooth or nail . They isolate out easily , naturally , and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence ; and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities . With the universal list as his weapon , Swadesh has extended his <head>march</head> of conquest farther and farther into the past , eight , ten , twelve millennia back .
