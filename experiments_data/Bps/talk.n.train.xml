      <context> `` You often hear people talk_about team_spirit and that sort of thing '' , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a_little different . The boys had a tremendous respect for each other 's ability . They knew what they could do and it was often a_little more than I thought they could do . `` Several times I found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight <head>talk</head> . We 'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say , ' Do n't worry , Coach - we 'll get 'em all_right '' ' . The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob_Broeg , sports_editor of the Post-Dispatch . Kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as_well as his all-round excellent play .</context>

      <context> An unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists . By the end of the third act , the artist is dead but the body lingers on , a shell among other shells . Not altogether a successful play , `` Epitaph_for_George_Dillon '' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling . It is awfully talky , for_instance , and not all_of the <head>talk</head> is terribly impressive . But it strikes sparks on_occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten . There is a fine second act , as an example , one in which Samuel_Groom , as Dillon , has an opportunity to blaze_away in one impassioned passage after another . This is an exciting young actor to watch .</context>

      <context> The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members . The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations . There is much <head>talk</head> in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation .</context>

      <context> We walked down the Rue_de_L_'_Arcade , thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church . The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world_shattering . For_one_thing , the world that Beckett sees is already shattered . His <head>talk</head> turns_to what he calls `` the mess '' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion '' . I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation . What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words . `` The confusion is not my invention .</context>

      <context> In the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate . The study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way . William_Wimsatt and Cleanth_Brooks , it seems to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in_which this control is effected : `` For if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation ) - then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affections at_all . Something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of <head>talk</head> about love and anger and even in something like '' expressions `` of these emotions , without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement '' . The rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience . Here I do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion . I mean something more like Freud 's concept of the utility of `` play '' to a small child : he plays `` house '' or `` doctor '' or `` fireman '' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control .</context>

      <context> What the next move will be only time , of_course , will tell . Personally , I think we ought to set_up an immediate naval_blockade of Cuba . We simply can n't tolerate further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba . Obviously , we can n't stop them from coming_in , however , just by <head>talk</head> . A naval_blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe_Doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry_out , and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere `` . Look_at Castro now - cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the_Americas . How can the United_States act ?</context>

      <context> If , on_the_other_hand , they opted_for representation , it had to be representation per_se - representation as image pure_and_simple , without connotations ( at_least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed . It was the collage that made the terms of_this dilemma clear : the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for_the_first_time , mutually_exclusive alternatives . In_the_end , Picasso and Braque plumped_for the representational , and it would seem they did so deliberately . ( This provides whatever real justification there is for the <head>talk</head> about `` reality '' . ) But the inner , formal_logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shaping their decision . When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesized '' - into larger planar shapes themselves simply in_order to maintain the integrity of the picture_plane . Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut_away too abruptly into depth ; and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump_out of plane .</context>

She was with Elizabeth . They were far off and looked tiny .</context>

      <context> Now wait a minute , she told herself , think_about it ; Lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee . She had lost a bottle of opium - but that was on the trip from New_Orleans . Or someone had taken it during her first day at Honotassa . Yes , she had missed it after her <head>talk</head> with Emile , after dinner , just before Emile was shot . Rilly or Glendora had entered her room while she slept , bringing back her washed clothes . So somebody else could have come_in , too - then or later while she was out of the room .

      <context> He had taken her all_right . Wednesday nights after youth fellowship . Out of the church and into his big car , it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college , his expansiveness , the quaint little pine board tourist_courts , cabins really , with a cute naked light_bulb in the ceiling ( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight , like the one on the corner where you used_to play when you were a kid , where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs , watching in between your bouts at hopscotch ) , a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls , an insect Highway_Patrol with feelers waving . And the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing <head>talk</head> in the next room when Gratt went_out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened . And Gratt_Shafer would be in Memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all_along . Like Mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and Toonker_Burkette back in his office yanking out teeth , like they all knew he would . Just like the balloon would go_up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to_hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen .</context>

      <context> We went_into Mrs._Monmouth 's library , which had low bookshelves all along the walls , and above them a Modigliani portrait , a Jackson_Pollock twelve feet long , and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow background , that looked_like an inscription from a Martian tomb . The fireplace had tiles made for Mrs._Monmouth by Picasso himself . Like certain expensive restaurants , just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself . In the course of our <head>talk</head> , Askington mentioned that he spent part of each_week studying . `` By yourself '' ? I asked . `` No , I take classes with different people '' , he said .</context>
