      <context> Rep._Wesley_Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West_Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman_Bill_Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 .

      <context> Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent_on following compulsively in his footsteps .

But to imitate an <head>opponent</head> when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly . When East_Germans fled to the West by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists . They are less vocal now , when it is the West_Berliners who are migrating . The flood is not as great - only 700 a week according_to one apparently conservative account - but it is symptomatic .</context>
