      <context> When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures . Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people - by the compass of their national ideas . But Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting . In all his miscalculations , Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers ' <head>inspirations</head> - representing many peoples , time_periods and styles - into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments . Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations - his brilliant Petruchka , his savage Sacre_du_Printemps , his incisive Les_Noces - the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed . But time is running_out , and many_of Stravinsky 's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra_firma . His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a_house_divided_against_itself : Supra_Expressionism , Neo Paganism , Neo_Classicism , Neo_Romanticism , Neo_Jazz , Neo Ecclesiasticism , Neo Popularism , and most_recently , Post Serialism - all competing with each other within one composer !</context>

      <context> Feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation . A need so deeply planted , asking for direction , so_to_speak , is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature . The terms `` renewal '' and `` refreshed '' , which often come_up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal '' of purpose and a `` refreshed '' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction . The notion of `` <head>inspiration</head> '' is somehow cognate to this feeling . How literature does this , or for whom , is certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the `` message '' , as_well_as the source , would all play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense_of_purpose . One of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion . Let us differentiate a_few of these ideas .</context>
