      <context> Which is more economical for your plant - a vacation shutdown or spaced vacations that require extra employees for vacation fill-ins ? Can vacations be spaced throughout the 12 months to minimize the number of employee fill-ins ? Do you insist that unneeded salary employees take their vacations during plant shutdowns ? What can your sales and purchasing_departments do to curtail orders , shipments , and <head>receipts</head> during vacation shutdown periods ? Is an arbitrary retirement age of 65 actually costing your plant money ? What sort of effort do you make to assure that older or disabled workers are fully productive ? Would early retirement of non-productive , disabled employees reduce the number of make-work jobs ?</context>

      <context> Interest at the rate of 6 % a year must be paid on taxes that are not paid on or before their due_date . Such interest must be paid even though an extension of time for filing is granted . If your computation on Form_1040 or Form_1040_A shows you owe additional tax , it should be remitted with your return unless you owe less_than $ 1 , in which case it is forgiven . If payment is by cash , you should ask for a <head>receipt</head> . If you file Form_1040_A and the District_Director computes your tax , you will be sent a bill if additional tax is_due . This bill should be paid within 30 days . Whether the check is certified or uncertified , the tax is not paid until the check is paid .</context>

      <context> The boundless blue_air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum . Leaving her house one late afternoon , Mrs._Pastern stopped to admire the October light . It was the day to canvass for infectious_hepatitis . Mrs._Pastern had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of <head>receipts</head> . It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks . Her house stood on a rise of ground , and before she got_into her car she looked at the houses below . Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity .</context>

      <context> The small car flew_on relentlessly . The old_woman , stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took_on an ominous reality . Abel moved and adjusted his long legs . `` I suppose it has to do with the property '' , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their <head>receipt</head> of the letters . Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted_out in one shameful moment of covetousness . He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape_Ann property which had seemed to have no_end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer . Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother .</context>
