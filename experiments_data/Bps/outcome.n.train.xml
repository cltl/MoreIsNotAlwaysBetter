      <context> The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United_States is weaker than the Soviet_Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead . This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human_beings typically do - namely , by taking steps to end_up on what appears to be the winning side . To the extent , then , that declining U._S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern . Still , these guesses about the <head>outcome</head> of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet_Union and ourselves . Here I do not speak_of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power - of influence , if you will - about which the relevant questions are : Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ? And is Western influence greater or less than it used to be ?</context>

      <context> They are in_general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual . They include both individual fears and collective ones . They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not_only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group . Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the <head>outcome</head> but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized . Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act . To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition . But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating .</context>

The binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another .

      <context> Fortunately , a general formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind . Before deriving this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind '' . Experiments are often composed of several identical trials , and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated . In the marksmanship example , a trial consists_of `` one round shot at a target '' with <head>outcome</head> either one bull's-eye ( success ) or none ( failure ) . Further , an experiment might consist_of five rounds , and several sets of five rounds might be regarded_as a super experiment composed of several repetitions of the five round experiment . If three dice are tossed , a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials . Or , what amounts to the same thing , if one die is tossed three times , each toss is a trial , and the three tosses form the experiment .</context>

      <context> These findings , and_others which will in_time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry . If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per_cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per_cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller . And irrespective of the <head>outcome</head> in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones . It is evident that Swadesh has not_only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items . Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list ? It is the urge to obtain a list as free_of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible .</context>
