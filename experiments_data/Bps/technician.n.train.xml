      <context> In_addition , many large corporations operate their own formal training_programs . A recent study indicated that 85 per_cent of the nation 's largest corporations conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and examinations . Most skilled industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions . The National_Manpower_Council of Columbia_University has estimated that three out of five skilled_workers and one out of five <head>technicians</head> have not been formally trained . There is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education . Employers prefer to hire youth with such training rather_than those without , and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training . Vocational educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled_workers , but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills .</context>
