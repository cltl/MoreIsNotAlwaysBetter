      <context> Land_reform programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture . Lastly , governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead . By holding_out prospects for external capital assistance , the United_States can provide strong incentives to prepare_for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth . At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India , <head>Brazil</head> , the Philippines , and Taiwan , which are ready and committed to move_into the stage of self-sustaining growth . They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups . But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies . On the economic front , the first priority of these countries is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources .</context>

      <context> He was in his mid_fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once_again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn_off lecturing . There was never a doubt any_more how his structures would be received ; it was always the same unqualified success now . He could no_longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in <head>Brazil</head> , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here_and_there he was taken_to_task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no_longer disputable as to its other values . Stowey_Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality . He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rose at half past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn_flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald_Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh_Gazette , then put_on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop . This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil_geologist .</context>
