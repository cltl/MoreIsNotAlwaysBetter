      <context> Also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented . It 's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse . He does n't really need the immense sum_of_money ( probably converted from American gold on the London_Exchange ) he makes them pay . For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his <head>lot</head> . He has a glorious wife and many children . When he needs money to buy something like , say , the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable_patch , he takes_a_flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies . One of those capital-gains ventures , in_fact , has saddled him with Gore_Court .</context>

      <context> That encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers . Pansies are gluttons . I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them . I spade <head>lots</head> of compost into their bed ; lacking that , decayed manure spread_over the bed is fine . One year I simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile , to which a_little sand had been added , and I had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my neighbors ' experience . In_addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every_other week , diluted to the color of weak tea . As a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used .</context>

      <context> She suffered a nervous_breakdown and had to be institutionalized . Mr._A. , her fellow townsman , also experienced a nervous_breakdown just as_soon_as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife - a woman suffering from an incurable disease , multiple_sclerosis - and himself . Mr._A has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man . `` That 's a <head>lot</head> of hard earned money to lose '' , he says today . `` Neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor 's treatments '' . And there was the case of Tom_Hepker , a machinist , who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what Doctor_Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine . After his pains got_worse , Tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung .</context>

      <context> The battle of the Naktong_River is just one example of how the battle_cry and the spirit of The Fighting_Seventh have paid_off . For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment . Take the case of Major_Marcus_A._Reno , who survived the Battle_of_The_Little_Big_Horn in 1876 . From the enlisted_men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a <head>lot</head> of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus_Reno . Many_of his fellow officers refused to speak_to him . But when a board of inquiry was called to look_into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him . He was a member of The Fighting_Seventh .</context>

      <context> Mathematically , we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times . These examples are illustrative of the use of the words `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are used in this chapter , but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to restrict them too narrowly . Ten students act_as managers for a high-school football_team , and of these managers a proportion p are licensed drivers . Each Friday one manager is chosen by <head>lot</head> to stay late and load the equipment on a truck . On three Fridays the coach has needed a driver . Considering only these Fridays , what is the probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times ? Exactly 2 times ?</context>

      <context> whether there is such fitness or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do . Let me illustrate . In his novel The_House_of_the_Dead , Dostoevsky tells of his experiences in a Siberian prison_camp . Whatever the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today , Dostoevsky 's companions were about as grim a <head>lot</head> as can be imagined . `` I have heard stories '' , he writes , `` of the most terrible , the most unnatural actions , of the most monstrous murders , told with the most spontaneous , childishly merry laughter '' . Most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very unfitting . If we were asked why we thought so , we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong , and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting .</context>

      <context> Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easier than to the downtown department_store , though both are the same distance from home . Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown . Raymond_Vernon reports that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the <head>lot</head> next_door . If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened_away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program . And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble . Today , according_to land economist Homer_Hoyt , shopping_centers and their associated parking_lots cover some 46000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land_area in all the nation 's Central Business_Districts put together .</context>

      <context> He seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians had large litters , and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens . `` Y_que_sigue_despues ? - what then '' ? he asked her severely . `` A <head>lot</head> of people are so peculiar that they do n't like cats , it 's not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens - and , damn_it , you know very_well if I have them around long , impossible to give them away ! And I suppose now that you 've finally grown_up , if a_little late , you 'd go_on producing kittens every six months or_so . Yes , well , it 's a pity to spoil your girlish figure - which all those kittens would do anyway - but I think when you 've raised these we 'll just have the vet fix it so there won n't be any more . I wonder if the Carters would take one .</context>

      <context> Tom had been laying for Aaron_McBride for a long_time , just waiting to catch him out of line . McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed_up in town with a pistol on his hip . He had a legitimate reason for wearing it . It was payday for Highlands , and he was packing a <head>lot</head> of money back into the oil_fields . Moreover , as_long_as the weapon was carried openly , the sheriff 's office had made no previous issue of_it . `` So what 's this all about '' ? he demanded , when Lord confronted him .

I found a trooper once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant_hill , and another time we ran_across some teamsters they 'd caught , tied upside_down on their own wagon_wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o ' their skulls . I heard o ' Texas cattlemen wrappin ' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin ' the sun shrink ' em and squeeze him to death .

      <context> You then descended one story , glommed a television_set from the music room - the only constructive feature of your visit , by_the_way - and , returning to the ground_floor , entered the master_bedroom . From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade handled magnifying_glass . Rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby , you unearthed an antique French chess_set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box_Kodaks , you added to your haul . Then , having wrapped the <head>lot</head> in an afghan my dog customarily slept on , you lammed out the front_door , considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover . So_much_for the tiresome facts , as familiar to you , I'm sure , as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake . The foregoing , aided by several clues I 'll withhold to keep you on_your_toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of Inspector_Javert , but before they close_in , gird yourselves , I repeat , for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless . Fourteen of the sculptures you took posses properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls_out in patches .</context>
