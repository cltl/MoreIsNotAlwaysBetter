      <context> If the reference direction is north ( either true north , magnetic north , or <head>grid</head> north ) , the bearing is termed an absolute bearing . In a contemporary land navigation context , true , magnetic , and grid bearings are always measured in this way , with true north , magnetic north , or grid north being 0Â° in a 360-degree system . In aircraft navigation , an angle is normally measured from the aircraft 's track or heading , in a clockwise direction .</context>
