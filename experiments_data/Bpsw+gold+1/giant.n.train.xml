      <context> The Pathet_Lao , stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring North Viet_Nam , were supplied by Soviet aircraft . The Royal_Lao_Army , on_the other hand , was paid and equipped with American funds . In six years , U._S. aid had amounted to more_than $ 1.60 for each American - a total of three hundred million dollars . We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world 's <head>giants</head> . Even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine_guns ? To find_out , we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at_least , by the Royal_Lao_Army : from Attopeu , the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast , to Muong_Sing , the City of Lions in the northwest , close to Communist_China ( map , page 250 ) . We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly .</context>

      <context> In many cases that statement `` We break_even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' would be turned_around if the cost_analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store . Fear of the competition - always a great motivating force in the American economy - makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival 's shiny new branches . The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches . Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act_as controllers for retail <head>giants</head> are beginning to discover . When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing . Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easier than to the downtown department_store , though both are the same distance from home . Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown .</context>

      <context> They lack stimulation . They sit alone in their rooms and try to paint , and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life . That 's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation . In the Middle_Ages , in the Renaissance , right up_to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a <head>giant</head> in the world . He was an artisan , a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood_carver did . He filled a real need , showing society what it looked_like , turning it inside_out , portraying its wars and its leaders , its ugliness and its beauties , reflecting its profound religious impulses . He was a propagandist - they were n't afraid of the word , then - satirist , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party .</context>
