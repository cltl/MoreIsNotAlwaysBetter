      <context> <head>The</head> formation of this harbour has occurred due to active erosional processes on an extinct shield volcano , whereby the sea has flooded the caldera creating an inlet 16 km in length , with an average width of 2 km and a depth of -13 m relative to mean sea level at the 9 km point down the transect of the central axis . The predominant storm wave energy has unlimited fetch for the outer harbour from a southerly direction , with a calmer environment within the inner harbour , though localised harbour breezes create surface currents and chop influencing the marine sedimentation processes . Deposits of loess from subsequent glacial periods have in filled volcanic fissures over millennia , resulting in volcanic basalt and loess as the main sediment types available for deposition in Akaroa Harbour</context>

Those which tell a story of the earth 's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites .

Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunting areas , caves , artifacts , etcetera .</context>
