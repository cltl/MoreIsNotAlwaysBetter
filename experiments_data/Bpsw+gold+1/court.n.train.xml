Vandiver likely will mention the $ 100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . Meanwhile , it was learned the State_Highway_Department is very near being ready to issue the first $ 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . The bond issue will go to the state <head>courts</head> for a friendly test_suit to test the validity of the act , and_then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway_Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural_Roads_Authority bonds for rural road construction work . The department apparently intends to make the Rural_Roads_Authority a revolving_fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid_off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov._Marvin_Griffin .</context>

      <context> Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness - a sort_of peasant dignity - too . It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons . The episode in which Sancho_Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island '' is one of the best in the film . True , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a_bit wearisome in the first_half , before Don_Quixote goes to the duke 's <head>court</head> . But strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old_boy .

      <context> Du_Pont 's counterproposal was filed on May 14 , 1958 .

Christiana and Delaware would , in_turn , be required to pass_on the voting_rights to the General_Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders . Du_Pont would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General_Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of du_Pont could serve as a director of General_Motors without <head>court</head> approval . Du_Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General_Motors stock except through General_Motors ' distributions of stock or subscription_rights to its stockholders . On June 6 , 1958 , General_Motors submitted its objections to the Government 's proposal . It argued , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both General_Motors and du_Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; that the tremendous volume of General_Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General_Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity .</context>

The decrees proposed by the amici_curiae were filed in August of 1958 . These plans , like du_Pont 's contained provisions for passing the vote on du_Pont 's General_Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their spouses , and other people living in their households , as_well_as other specified persons , were to be totally disenfranchised .

Back_and_forth Duclos had_to go , between M._de_Cury and Jean_Jacques and between the Duke_d'Aumont and Jean_Jacques again , as his little operetta , The_Village_Soothsayer , though still unperformed , took_on ever more importance . And of_course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get_around among his closest friends . But they , naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at_large knew only of a great excitement in musical and <head>court</head> circles . How titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals . The furor was such_that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational . And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe , Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration , trembling lest his authorship become known , and at_the_same_time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer .</context>

Such items recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie_star : `` The area in which Miss_N - was injured is spectacularly scenic '' .
