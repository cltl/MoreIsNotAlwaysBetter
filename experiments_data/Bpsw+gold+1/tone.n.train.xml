      <context> We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers . Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms . So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting_grounds of `` Uncle_Sam '' ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedoms in <head>tone</head> , color , dance , design , and thought . Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing . In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native_land . The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission .</context>

      <context> `` You do n't have_to watch what you say . Of_course , I would like to go_to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people , but I would want lots of Jewish kids there '' . For most Brooklyn_College students , college is at_once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking_away from the cage of neighborhood and family . Brooklyn_College is unequivocally Jewish in <head>tone</head> , and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing_in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing . However , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents . And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view_as softly and insidiously enveloping . `` As_long_as I 'm home , I 'll never grow_up '' , a nineteen year old boy observed sadly .</context>

      <context> His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence . Beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high_society and low morals , always alone , always despised . In_the_end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care ; virtue is its own and only reward . A similar <head>tone</head> of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of Eric_Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery_stories , Dashiell_Hammett 's The Maltese_Falcon . Sam_Spade joins_forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; but when the bird is found at_last , it turns_out to be a fake . Now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves , who is also the real murderer . For Sam_Spade , neither crime nor virtue pays ; moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two .</context>

      <context> I think you could have heard him a mile away , and he was bursting at every seam with importance . I have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man , and when a very small man is up on a saddle , he 'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there . That 's understandable , and I appreciate the sentiment . As for this rider , I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted , so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes , I can n't say ; but I do know that he gave the day <head>tone</head> and distinction . The last thing in_the_world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone_wall , and this dashing rider made us feel a good_deal sharper and more alert to the situation . We came_down off the wall as if he had toppled all_of us , and we crouched behind it . I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars , but that only proves that a_lot of people talk_about things of which they are deplorably ignorant .</context>

      <context> Askington was a kind of goal I set myself ; I had admired him long before I talked to him . It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income . The night we first met , at one of Mrs._Monmouth 's giant parties , he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt ; instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade . This set his <head>tone</head> : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as_well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off 's rent for a year . He was fifteen years older than I - forty four - but full of spring and sparkle . He did n't look_like what I thought_of as an old_man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger . He was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in America ; you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every_month .</context>
