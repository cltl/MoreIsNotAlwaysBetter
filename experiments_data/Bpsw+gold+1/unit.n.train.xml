      <context> Carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that RA berth , and he wanted to play it cool . So Mel_Chandler set_out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before . When the Korean_war began , on June 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day Custer had gone_down fighting at the Little_Big_Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World_War_2 , , the 7_th_Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition . Its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another <head>unit</head> , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World_War_2 , . Just a month after the Korean_War broke_out , the 7_th_Cavalry was moving_into the lines , ready for combat . From then on the Fighting_Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in Korea . One night on the Naktong_River , Mel_Chandler called_on that fabled esprit_de_corps .</context>

      <context> Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk_officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces . The next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding_officer of Troop_H , 7_th_Cavalry , in_the_middle of corps maneuvers in Japan . Outside of combat , he could n't have landed in a tougher spot . First_of_all , no <head>unit</head> likes to have a new CO brought_in from the outside , especially when he 's an armchair trooper . Second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull_the_rug_out_from_under him , it 's on maneuvers . In combat , helping your CO make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed . But in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all_the_time , it 's easy .</context>

      <context> Also , the program for fleet modernization will be stepped_up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures . Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year . Other factors increasing operating_costs include the higher unit_cost of each flying hour , up 11 % in two years , and of each steaming hour , up 15 % . In total , these increases in operating_costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such_as reduced numbers of <head>units</head> and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed_Forces . In the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 ) . This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying_out certain transactions involving real_property unless they come into agreement with the Committees_on_Armed_Services of the Senate and the House_of_Representatives . As I have stated previously , the Attorney_General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles .</context>

      <context> He finds the structure contains an **f bond with the **f distance of **f . There is , then , the possibility that this **f bond is symmetric , although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data .

X-ray and experimental density showed one formula <head>unit</head> in the unit_cell , corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of **f .

      <context> Thus the first lines of one of Charles_Wesley 's hymns are as_follows . `` A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify '' . In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . Dominant stress is of_course more than extended duration , and normally centers_on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer <head>units</head> they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center_on its first syllable rather than its last . But the parallel is significant . When the answer to what 's wrong now ? is Bill 's broken a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair .</context>

      <context> Other examples follow . `` I 'll come by Tuesday . I can n't be happy long without drinking water '' . In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent_to on Tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken_language ; but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a prepositional <head>unit</head> used as an adjunct , by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at_most . In the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking_water is equivalent_to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water . But the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for_example , can undermine distinctions such_as these . And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by_any_means .</context>

      <context> And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by_any_means . In the Steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them , and in I looked_up the number and I looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second . - Syllables are linguistic_units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but , as has been noted , are consonantal under certain circumstances , and which may or may not be combined with preceding and / or following consonants or combinations of consonants . Syllables are genuine <head>units</head> , but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties . Sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear . Doubt on this point is strongest before / l / and / / or / r / . From the point_of_view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables .</context>

      <context> Still , even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect . A third explanation is suggested by Richardson 's analysis of Sukuma tone . There we see a basically simple phonemic_system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic_system . While the phonemes can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in_some_way to morphemic <head>units</head> , i._e. until the morphophonemics is worked_out , or at_least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success . In the `` typical tone_language '' , tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics . The phonemic_systems which must support these morphophonemic_systems , however , are very different . The inventory of tones is much smaller , and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension , pitch level .</context>

      <context> This can only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are insufficiently general . If , as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems . One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems . Since tone_systems typically comprise fewer <head>units</head> than either consonant or vowel_systems , we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis . Actual practice does not often work_out this way . Tone_systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal_systems . Welmers has suggested one explanation .</context>

      <context> But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago - a new bedroom_set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior - the family set_off for the downtown department_store , where the selection would be greatest . Department_stores congregated in the `` one_hundred per_cent location '' , where all the transit_lines converged . These stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more_and_more dry_goods .

The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened .</context>
