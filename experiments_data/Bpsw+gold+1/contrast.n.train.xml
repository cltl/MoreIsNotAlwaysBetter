      <context> Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought_on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr._Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies . Interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney_General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke_off the flow . But there was a <head>contrast</head> even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and New_York . In each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin 's dictatorship ; in the United_States the initiation of militant anti Communism , with the repentant ex Communist in the vanguard . These trials were properly termed `` political cases '' in_that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences . But what could the Eichmann Trial initiate ?</context>

      <context> To swim is true , and to sink is true . One is not more true than the other . One cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess . When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a <head>contrast</head> between being and existence , they may be right , I do n't know , but their language is too philosophical for me . I am not a philosopher . One can only speak of what is in_front of him , and that now is simply the mess '' . Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form .</context>

      <context> Actual practice does not often work_out this way . Tone_systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal_systems . Welmers has suggested one explanation . Tone_languages use for linguistic <head>contrasts</head> speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use . This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable . The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features . Of_course , something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology : consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and an individual component .</context>
