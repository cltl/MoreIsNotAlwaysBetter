Larry_Scherer last night pitched a no-hit_game , said to be the first in Billiken baseball history , as the Blue_and_White beat Southeast_Missouri_State_College , 5 - 1 , at Crystal_City . The victory was the first of the <head>season</head> for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie . The tie was against Southeast_Missouri last Friday . Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , Len_Boehmer also was 4 - for - 5 with two doubles and Dave_Ritchie had a home_run and a triple . St._Louis_U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington_University at Ligget_Field .</context>

      <context> The game opened a busy week for Washington . The Bears are set to play at Harris_Teachers_College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy , Ill. , Saturday .

      <context> Mays and Mantle , both 10 - year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they 've never hit the heights . Their heights , that_is . Mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown_season , 1959 , when he batted .365 and also led the American_League in home_runs , 52 , and RBIs , 130 . Like the Yankees ' slugger , Mays , the terror of the Giants , has had <head>seasons</head> that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by - or for - Willie . His best years were 1954 when he hit .345 with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home_runs , drove_in 127 and stole 24 bases . Now , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they 're going_to pass those previous peaks . Yes , we know , they 're professionals , men paid to play , and they should n't care how they 're handled , just as_long_as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each_month .</context>

      <context> And due_to modern resource use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever expanding encroachment on land and water . Present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural_resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped . Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more_than 40 states , on shooting_preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game management ) for five and six months each_year . Close to two million game_birds were harvested on 1500 commercial and private shooting_preserves , and on State_Game_Commission controlled upland game areas during the 1960 - 61 <head>season</head> . The shooting development program of the Sporting_Arms_and_Ammunition_Manufacturers_'_Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers . The most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting_preserves . This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the New_York staff of the Sportsmen's_Service_Bureau , and the SAAMI shooting_preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 .</context>
