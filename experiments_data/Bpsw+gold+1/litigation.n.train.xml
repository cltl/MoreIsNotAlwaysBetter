This study concluded that the new rules that were set for litigation financing actually did produce more settlements .</context>

      <context> If the claim is denied , then the claimant ( or policyholder or applicant <head>)</head> files a lawsuit with the courts and later participates in the lawsuit . In medieval times , both " action " and " suit " had the approximate meaning of some kind of legal proceeding , but an action terminated when a judgment was rendered , while a suit also included the execution of the judgment . Particularly in the United States , plaintiffs and defendants who lack financial resources for litigation or other attorney 's fees may be able to obtain legal financing .</context>

      <context> The displacement ( at_least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international_law theory and doctrine . In_the_first_place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal_system . One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded_as the law_of_nations . Admiralty_law , the law_merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private <head>litigation</head> because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law_of_Nations and made dependent_on the several national laws . Private international_law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international_law proper , or , as it is often called , public international_law . States were free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , their own rules as_to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law_merchant , and to enact legislation with regard_to many claims arising on the high_seas . The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in_fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations .</context>
