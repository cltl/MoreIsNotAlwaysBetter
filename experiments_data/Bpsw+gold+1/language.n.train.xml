      <context> Nomenclature is a system of names or terms , or the rules for forming <head>these</head> terms in a particular field of arts or sciences . The principles of naming vary from the relatively informal conventions of everyday speech to the internationally agreed principles , rules and recommendations that govern the formation and use of the specialist terms used in scientific and other disciplines . Naming " things " is a part of general human communication using words and language : it is an aspect of everyday taxonomy as people distinguish the objects of their experience , together with their similarities and differences , which observers identify , name and classify .</context>
