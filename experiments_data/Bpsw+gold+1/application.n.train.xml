      <context> Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray_machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy_machine . Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis . Commonly used electronic_devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit TV and audio_systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices . In this article we will concentrate_on the advances in the <head>application</head> of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow 's commonplace equipment originates . From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a_few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research . Many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible_light and must be stained for microscopic investigation . This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or_else colors only the outside .</context>

      <context> The Bureau contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr._W._A._Wildhack , General_Chairman , and Dr._C._M._Herzfeld , Program_Chairman . Dr._A._V._Astin , NBS_Director , opened the 5 - day session with introductory remarks , following which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week by NBS scientists , from both the Washington and Boulder_Laboratories . In_addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards , spectroscopy , solid_state physics , interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress , the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics . The programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared , the <head>application</head> of infrared techniques to solid_state studies , and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation . Two data centers have been established for the collection , indexing , critical evaluation , and dissemination of bibliographies and critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision cross_sections . Under the sponsorship of the Office_of_Naval_Research and the Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency , a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities . An exhaustive survey was made of the literature , and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued .</context>

      <context> Spring used a Brush surface analyzer in a metal cleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending_upon surface roughness . There are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard surface cleaning . Exclusive of esthetic values , such_as high - or low foam level , perfume content , etc. , the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high . No matter how they are formulated , a large_number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this <head>application</head> , since they do not give adequate soil removal . This is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation . A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings ; whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a build-up of `` tattle-tale_grey '' and dirty spots - sometimes with bad results even after the first wash . Since practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive , a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of detergents .</context>

      <context> Albert ( 1949 ) has concluded that the most active preparations of TSH made during this period , from 1931 to 1945 , were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material . Much of this work has been reviewed by White ( 1944 ) and by Albert ( 1949 ) . Developments up_to about 1957 have been discussed by Sonenberg ( 1958 ) . In the last few years , the <head>application</head> of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the problem of isolating TSH has led to further purification ( Bates and Condliffe , 1960 ; Pierce , Carsten and Wynston , 1960 ) . The most active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators appear to be similar in potency , composition and physical_properties . Two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood . First , is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored ?</context>

      <context> Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl_test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm . Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not_yet been tested on an adequate number of patients . The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable . It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the <head>application</head> of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep wakefulness cycle . A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting . In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such_as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs . The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated .</context>

    <instance id="br-j17#w1643_0" docsrc="br-j17">
      <context> The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion . If this is the case , one would expect that not_only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional_state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise . We pointed_out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic_disorders and neurotic symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( `` abreaction '' ) may cure a battle neurosis . This phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may_not have an even wider <head>application</head> in the area of the neuroses . Being a strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself . Wolpe 's experiments and therapeutic work lie_in this area . He showed convincingly that anxiety is a learned ( conditioned_)_reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed , therefore , that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional and reversible .</context>

      <context> The former comprise analeptic and psychoactive_drugs , the latter the tranquilizers . Specific differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging_to the same group as , for_instance , between reserpine and chlorpromazine . Important as these differences are , they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side , we produce depressions , whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and , eventually , maniclike changes . The emotional_states produced by drugs influence the cortical_potentials in a characteristic manner ; synchrony prevails in the EEG of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizers , but asynchrony after <head>application</head> of analeptic and psychoactive_drugs . The shock_therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance . Physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges . They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side .</context>

      <context> This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary_entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word . The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file . Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis . We suggest the <head>application</head> of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem . But first , we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood : form - any unique sequence of alphabetic_characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space . occurrence - an instance of a form in text .</context>

    <instance id="br-j32#w1926_0" docsrc="br-j32">
      <context> The only requirements on dictionary information made by the text lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms . This leaves the ordering of entries variable . ( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it . ) Two very useful ways for modifying a form dictionary are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the <head>application</head> of a single change to more_than one dictionary form . The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage . The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents . Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at_once .</context>

      <context> One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded_as the law_of_nations . Admiralty_law , the law_merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law_of_Nations and made dependent_on the several national laws . Private international_law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international_law proper , or , as it is often called , public international_law . States were free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , their own rules as_to the <head>application</head> of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law_merchant , and to enact legislation with regard_to many claims arising on the high_seas . The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in_fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations .</context>
