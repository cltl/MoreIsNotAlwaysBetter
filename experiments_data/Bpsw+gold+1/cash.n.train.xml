      <context> <head>In</head> the early part of the 17th century , English East India Company coins were minted in England and shipped to the East . In England over time the word ‘ Cash ’ was adopted from Sanskrit कर्ष karsa , a weight of gold or silver but akin to Old Persian  karsha , unit of weight ( 83.30 grams ) .</context>

      <context> <head>In</head> 1671 the directors of The East India Company ordered a mint to be established at Bombay , known as Bombain . In 1677 this was sanctioned by the Crown , the coins , having received royal sanction were struck as silver Rupees ; the inscription runs The Rupee of Bombaim , by authority of Charles II. Cash has now become a very small part of the money supply .</context>

      <context> Are you in a rural or urban_area ? These factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program . Above_all , do n't set_up extravagant fringe_benefits just to buy employee good_will . Unions stress fringe_benefits , but the individual hourly worker prefers <head>cash</head> every time . Aim to balance your employee benefit package . Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe - say a liberal retirement plan - and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere . They 're asking_for union trouble .</context>

      <context> If you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $ 300 to $ 500 with attachments , 1960 prices ) . These tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing . Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer . If you are going_to farm for extra <head>cash</head> income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises . You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs . If an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed - such_as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder - it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work . Before you look_for a farm you 'll need_to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want_to undertake ; and ( 2 ) whether you want_to buy or rent .</context>

      <context> Interest at the rate of 6 % a year must be paid on taxes that are not paid on or before their due_date . Such interest must be paid even though an extension of time for filing is granted . If your computation on Form_1040 or Form_1040_A shows you owe additional tax , it should be remitted with your return unless you owe less_than $ 1 , in which case it is forgiven . If payment is by <head>cash</head> , you should ask for a receipt . If you file Form_1040_A and the District_Director computes your tax , you will be sent a bill if additional tax is_due . This bill should be paid within 30 days . Whether the check is certified or uncertified , the tax is not paid until the check is paid .</context>
