Command 's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one . Like the recent Scheherazade from London ( High_Fidelity , Sept. 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering <head>practices</head> rather_than on creating sensational effects . Because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers ' triumph .

      <context> The quantity of water flow may be critical ; a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer .

Other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value .

      <context> The size of the area alone can be a determining_factor . An area may be too small for the needs of the project .

Acreage in_excess_of the minimum is good <head>practice</head> as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones .

      <context> In_general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical . This development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National_Council_of_Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the US . The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family_planning . It called_for opposition to laws and institutional <head>practices</head> restricting the information or availability of contraceptives . The general board declared : `` Most_of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .

For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief .</context>

The resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father_Galtier 's mission , St._Paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take_on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red_River . While population at Fort_Garry increased rapidly , from 2417 in 1831 to 4369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate . Accordingly , though the <head>practice</head> violated the no trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's_Bay_Company , some settlers went into trade . The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought_in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain_from trading in furs . Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort_Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs . In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per_cent duty on imports via Hudson's_Bay which were viewed_as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' .</context>

      <context> It is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by_no_means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research . The student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at_the_same_time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another . Let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought - turning our attention from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades . We may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious <head>practice</head> and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts . Finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at_present widespread . No one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them . Still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature .</context>

The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West .

      <context> The common codes , for religious action as_such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotees together . These are ways of jointly participating in significantly symbolized , standardized , and ordered religiously sanctified behavior . The codes are mechanism for training in , and directing and enforcing , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group . Durkheim noted long_ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and <head>practices</head> relative to sacred things - unite [ s ] into one single moral community - all those who adhere to them '' . His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit . This is brought_out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United_States ; and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds . The unifying effect of religion is also brought_out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more_or_less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized .</context>

      <context> it might be pointed_out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings - political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic . Religion usually exercises a stabilizing conserving function . As_such it acts_as an anchor for the people . There is a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change , not_only in their own doctrines and policies and <head>practices</head> , but also in secular affairs having religious relevance . It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones . It tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments , the traditional ways of thinking , and the customary ways of living .

      <context> If , as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems . One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems . Since tone_systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel_systems , we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis . Actual <head>practice</head> does not often work_out this way . Tone_systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal_systems . Welmers has suggested one explanation .
