But hear Harrison_E._Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The_New_York_Times , and author of `` To_Moscow_-_And_Beyond '' . In a book review of `` The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State_Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West_Contacts_Staff in_order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet <head>borders</head> , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy_and_Bess ' overrode the State_Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz_musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo_montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry_Ford , Hugh_Cooper , Thomas_Campbell , the International_Harvester_Co. , and David_W._Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' .</context>
