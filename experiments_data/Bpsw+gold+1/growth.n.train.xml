      <context> Has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yr. ? With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today - and it will be tougher in_the future . Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due_to the demanding combination of qualifications called_for by this type of management work . The <head>growth</head> of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties . Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management_personnel for the longer term ? Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? Every single problem touched_on thus_far is related to good marketing planning .</context>

      <context> The popularity of folklore in America stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in America . And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in_proportion_to the <head>growth</head> of American influence across the world . Thus , if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century , we will do_well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset . Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence . 1 ) Every age rewrites the events of its history in_terms_of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions .</context>

      <context> The major weakness of vocational training_programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands . This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country . Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained_workers . All the manuals for setting_up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the <head>growth</head> of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content . Furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys . Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded_as more hypothetical . While the U._S. Department_of_Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning .</context>
