Depending on the exact definition of the terms used , molecular biology can be thought of as a branch of biochemistry , or biochemistry as a tool with which to investigate and study molecular biology . Much of biochemistry deals with the structures , functions and interactions of biological macromolecules , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates and lipids , which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life .</context>
