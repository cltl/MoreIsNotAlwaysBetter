      <context> The complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English_language that has been excellently dubbed in_place_of the Russian dialogue . The voices of all the characters , including that of Cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities . And the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed . Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish , there is no <head>violation</head> of artistry or logic here . Splendid , too , is the performance of Yuri_Tolubeyev , one of Russia 's leading comedians , as Sancho_Panza , the fat , grotesque `` squire '' . Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness - a sort_of peasant dignity - too . It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons .</context>

      <context> I should_like at this time , Mr._Speaker , to pay warm tribute to Arthur_Hays_Sulzberger and Charles_Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism .

      <context> This Court agreed with the trial_court `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not overlooked by either du_Pont or General_Motors '' . 353_U._S._,_at_606 . However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including du_Pont 's competitors '' , 353_U._S._,_at_607 , outweighed the Government 's claim for relief . This claim , as submitted to the District_Court and dismissed by it , 126_F._Supp .235 , alleged <head>violation</head> not_only of 7 of the Clayton_Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman_Act . The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce .</context>

      <context> Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du_Pont and General_Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute . We repeat , that the test of a <head>violation</head> of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints . The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition '' . 353_U._S._,_at_607 . On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion , the Court remanded the case to the District_Court to determine the appropriate relief .</context>

      <context> Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city . He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments . In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took_part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned '' . He recalled that in Rhode_Island a party opposed to the state 's condemnation of a man ( Thomas_W._Dorr ) proclaimed the state 's action as a <head>violation</head> of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty . At the close of Davis ' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously : Whereas , John_Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper : Therefore ,</context>
