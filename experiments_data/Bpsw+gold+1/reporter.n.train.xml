      <context> Matthew C. Nisbet , who has written on science <head>communication</head> , has defined a " knowledge journalist " as a public intellectual who , like Walter Lippmann , David Brooks , Fareed Zakaria , Naomi Klein , Michael Pollan , Thomas Friedman , and Andrew Revkin , sees their role as researching complicated issues of fact or science which most laymen would not have the time or access to information to research themselves , then communicating an accurate and understandable version to the public as a teacher and policy advisor . Journalists sometimes expose themselves to danger , particularly when reporting in areas of armed conflict or in states that do not respect the freedom of the press . Organizations such as the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders publish reports on press freedom and advocate for journalistic freedom .</context>

      <context> The Village office of Western_Union with George_Towsley as manager and telegrapher continued in Hard 's drugstore until 1905 . During the summers , Towsley often needed the assistance of a company_operator . These were the years when people flocked to Manchester not_only to play golf , which had come into vogue , but also to witness the Ekwanok Country_Club tournaments . New_Yorkers were kept informed of scores by <head>reporters</head> who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers . This boosted local telegraph business and Manchester basked in all the free advertising . In 1914 when the town was chosen for the U._S._Amateur_Golf tournament , a representative hurried here from the Boston manager 's office . In his wake came the District_Traffic_Supervisor and the cream of the telegraphic profession , ten of Boston 's best , chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge of golf .</context>

      <context> The nude was small and black-haired and elfin , and was called `` Eloise '' . This was one place where Moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without anyone noticing him , or at_least coming_up and hanging_around and wanting to know all the low-down . The other patrons were taxi_drivers and art_students and small shopkeepers . The <head>reporters</head> had not_yet discovered that this was his hideaway . His friend Jane was with him . She was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did weigh too_much and did n't own the mint . She was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash , and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury .</context>

      <context> Once , Andrus walked by it , hastily scanned the bold black headline and the five column lead of the article ( by Duane_Bosch , staff correspondent - age not given ) , and muttered : `` We a buncha national celebrities '' . McFeeley told the parents he would escort them to police_headquarters in a half hour . Before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbors . He did not want_to bring the Andruses to the station_house too early - Rheinholdt had summoned a press_conference , and he did n't want them subjected to the <head>reporters</head> again . He could think_of nothing else to tell them : no assurances , no hopeful hints at great discoveries that day . When the detective left , Andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project . Mrs._Andrus was talking to the maid , arranging for her to come in every_day , instead of the four days she now worked .</context>

When the detective left , Andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project . Mrs._Andrus was talking to the maid , arranging for her to come in every_day , instead of the four days she now worked . Outside , only a handful of <head>reporters</head> remained . The bulk of the press_corps was covering Rheinholdt 's conference . In_contrast to the caravan of the previous night , there were only four cars parked across the street . Two men he did not recognize were sipping coffee and munching sweet_rolls .</context>

      <context> He did not see Sparling , or DeGroot , or Ringel , or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed him twelve hours ago . However , the litter remained , augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers . The street_cleaner had not_yet been around . One of the <head>reporters</head> called to him : `` Anything new , Lieutenant '' ? And he ignored him , skirting the parked cars and walking up the path to the Skopas house . When McFeeley was halfway to the door , the proprietor emerged - a mountainous , dark man , his head thick_with resiny black hair , his eyes like two of the black_olives he imported in boatloads . McFeeley identified himself .</context>

      <context> Flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps , they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait . It was amazing how they had herded together for protection : an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper , rising from the breakfast_table ; a gross boy in his teens , shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; a girl in her twenties , fat and sullen , descending the marble staircase ; then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor . They answered him in monosyllables , nods , occasionally muttering in Greek to one another , awaiting the word from Papa , who restlessly cracked his knuckles , anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst off to the freeway . No , they had n't seen anyone around ; no , they did n't know the Andrus family ; yes , they had read about the case ; yes , they had let some <head>reporters</head> use their phone , but they would no_longer . They offered no opinions , volunteered nothing , betrayed no emotions . Studying them , McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple . The Skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human_beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy .</context>

      <context> Andy invented a job to keep him busy , sending him ahead to El_Dorado to supervise last_minute arrangements . But from Rocco_Vecchio , they heard nothing . At_last it was time to depart . Hub , nosing about , spotted <head>reporters</head> in the lobby , so Andy was hustled away quietly through the hotel 's service_entrance in a strange car which Hub had procured somewhere . They succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel , but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub . El_Dorado was surrounded by a mob . They overflowed the parking_lot , making progress by automobile difficult .</context>

      <context> `` I'm terribly upset '' , she told a girl-friend . `` I wrote Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I did n't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind - and he seems to have misunderstood me '' . Evidently Bill was another of those men who simply do n't understand women . Another case involves a newspaper <head>reporter</head> who tripped_up a politician . `` Mr._Jones , you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted the contradiction of your original statement . Now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard_to it '' ? Questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician .</context>

      <context> Now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard_to it '' ? Questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician . They recall Byron 's classic comment : `` I wish he would explain his explanation '' . Similarly , when a <head>reporter</head> once questioned Lincoln in cryptic fashion , Lincoln refused to make any further statement . `` I fear explanations explanatory of things explained '' , he said , leaving the biter bit - and bitter . The obscurity of politicians may_not always be as innocent as it looks . `` Senator '' , said an interviewer , `` your constituents can n't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' .</context>
