Other pilot_programs were conducted by A_+_S , Babylon , New_York ; J._L._Hudson , Detroit ; Joseph_Horne , Pittsburgh . Other THC activities followed , conducted by shopping_centers , department_stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio - TV stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related_to hunting and wise use of our natural_resources . SAAMI 's field men have served as consultants and / or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter <head>Club</head> activities which have reached over 40000 enthusiastic young Americans . Through the efforts of SAAMI 's shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a_few . The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many_of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it .</context>

An understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron_cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity .

He was brigadier of the <head>club</head> 's locker-room light infantry , and at one time or another declared war on Russia , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , and China . It all began on an autumn afternoon - and who , after all these centuries , can describe the fineness of an autumn day ? One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it . The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year 's lights .</context>
