      <context> In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under_way during the first decade . As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share_in the manufacturer 's as_well as the distributor 's profits - which is , in_effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do . Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded . Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution <head>outlets</head> and chain_stores have insisted on high_quality - and the customer seems to have caught_on . If you are up_against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ? If private brand competition has n't been felt in your product field as_yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? Display merchandising , backed by pre selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties .</context>
