      <context> Recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction . He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as_well_as of mortality . Therefore Irenaeus describes man 's creation as_follows : `` So_that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted_up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take_up an <head>attitude</head> of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all . And He laid_down for him certain conditions : so_that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' . These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result . There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) .</context>

      <context> When Prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose '' , he shaped his talents to his purpose . When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures . Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people - by the compass of their national ideas . But Stravinsky was swayed by the <head>attitudes</head> of whatever culture he was reflecting . In all his miscalculations , Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers ' inspirations - representing many peoples , time_periods and styles - into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments . Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations - his brilliant Petruchka , his savage Sacre_du_Printemps , his incisive Les_Noces - the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed .

      <context> Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence . 1 ) Every age rewrites the events of its history in_terms_of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions . What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred . 2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political <head>attitudes</head> on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness . Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account_for group_actions , to provide a focal_point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification . One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United_States in more recent years .

One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost .

What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their <head>attitudes</head> hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self_enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non Jewish world . Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn_College - constituting 85 per_cent of those who attend the day session - can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower_middle_class Jewish student .

      <context> Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation . In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per_cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' . If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 per_cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact . On the surface , this seems a sound approach to Christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly <head>attitudes</head> that they care_for new people ; the new people respond in_kind by joining the church . Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations . This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking_up the wave_lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social_class nucleus of the congregation . Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so_long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless - friendly contacts no_longer keep it going .</context>

A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy .

Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs . The result of this <head>attitude</head> has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic ' esthetics ' , which usually turns_out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried_over from European languages . Many_of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they purport to represent . Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance . As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion .</context>

      <context> As these maladies overlap , so must the cure . Analyses such_as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple . They will give suggestions that can be worked_up into field procedures . Good field techniques will not_only equip linguists for better work , but also help them overcome negative <head>attitudes</head> . Actually , none of these papers says much directly about field techniques . But it is worth pondering that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics . These things have been disseminated by other means , but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic results .</context>

      <context> But in_general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude . With tone , individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them . Pitch differences from one speaker to another , or from one emotional_state to another , may far exceed the small differences between tones . However , any such suggestion accounts_for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone , or in developing a realistic <head>attitude</head> about tone , but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded . A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands ' paper . Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed . Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other .</context>

      <context> If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states . However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment . Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in <head>attitudes</head> toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . This probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment_compensation or a Youth_Conservation_Corps . A maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from home . A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor .</context>

      <context> Wage price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces - no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage price behavior of a_few very important industries . While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United_States since World_War_2 , . Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's <head>attitude</head> in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here presented . The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price_competition , but which is so basic that its wage price policies are held in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications .</context>

      <context> So_far_as I can see , there is only one way_out for the positivist . He holds that goodness and badness lie_in feelings of approval or disapproval . And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging_to the pain itself . The pain in itself was neutral ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no grounds at_all , took_up toward this neutral object an <head>attitude</head> of disapproval and that made it for_the_first_time , and in the only intelligible sense , bad . This way of escape is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so_far_as I know , been urged by positivists , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it . I come now to a third argument , which again is very simple . When we come_upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling .</context>

We all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one <head>attitude</head> is fitting and another not ; but on the theory before us such a belief would not make_sense .

      <context> Clearly not . Indeed we should say , on_the_contrary , that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal 's pain , that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not . If so , then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only . We are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an <head>attitude</head> toward it . The first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference .
