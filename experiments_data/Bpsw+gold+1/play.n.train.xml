      <context> Treatise on Arms was written <head>by</head> Diego de Valera between 1458 and 1471 and is one of the oldest surviving manuals on western fencing shortly before dueling came under official ban by the Catholic Monarchs . In conquest , the Spanish forces carried fencing around the world , particularly southern Italy , one of the major areas of strife between both nations . Fencing was mentioned in the play The Merry Wives of Windsor written sometime prior to 1602 .</context>

      <context> Jackie_Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally . Jim_Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel 's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first_baseman Throneberry 's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error . Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners . When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut_down in a close <head>play</head> at third , Tuttle to Andy_Carey . The detailed rundown on the Kansas_City scoring in the sixth went like this : Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde 's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center . Carey singled on a slow bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut_across to field and threw wide to first .</context>

      <context> `` He knocked_down the interference and made key stops lots_of times . And he caused the fumble that set_up our touchdown . He broke that boy ( Air_Force fullback Nick_Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football '' . Gannon contributed saving <head>plays</head> on the Falcons ' aerial thrusts in the late stages . One was on a fourth down screen_pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon 's territory . `` As_soon_as it started to form , Gannon spotted it '' , Meek said . `` He timed it just_right and broke_through there before the boy ( halfback Terry_Isaacson ) had time to turn_around .</context>

      <context> `` He timed it just_right and broke_through there before the boy ( halfback Terry_Isaacson ) had time to turn_around . He really crucified him . He nailed it for a yard loss '' . The Air_Force's , and the game 's , final <head>play</head> , was a long pass by quarterback Bob_McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards . `` He just lay back there and waited for it '' , Meek said . `` He almost brought it back all_the_way '' . Except for sophomore center Mike_Kelsey and fullback Mike_Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice .</context>

      <context> A Texas halfback who does n't even know the team 's <head>plays</head> , Eldon_Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest_Conference scoring after three games . Time stands_still every time Moritz , a 26 - year old Army_Signal_Corps veteran , goes_into the field . Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick - several every Saturday , in_fact - out of football . Moritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip_pads but he 's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the cotton_bowl .</context>

      <context> Except for sophomore center Mike_Kelsey and fullback Mike_Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice . `` Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game '' , Meek said . `` He 'll be out_of_action all this week . He got hit from the blind side by the split_end coming_back on the second <head>play</head> of the game . There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee '' . Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland . `` He 's looking a_lot better , and he 's able to run '' , Meek explained .</context>

      <context> He was called_upon 26 times - more than all_of the other ball carriers combined - and delivered 145 yards . The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver 's Al_Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave_Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al_Reynolds claimed it for Dallas . A quick touchdown resulted . `` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right_away '' , said Stram , quipping , `` I think I 'll put that <head>play</head> in the book '' . The early Southwest_Conference football leaders - Texas , Arkansas and Texas_A+M - made a big dent in the statistics last week . Texas ' 545 - yard spree against Washington_State gave the Longhorns a 3 - game total offense of 1512 yards ( 1065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high . Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A+M , with a 38 - point bulge against Texas_Tech ran_up its biggest total loop play since 1950 .</context>

      <context> `` If you kick too_much , your leg gets kinda dead '' , he explained . In their first three games , the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per_cent their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries . Tailback James_Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games . Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington_State game , for four <head>plays</head> : he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and_then uncorked a 56 - yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench . Wingback Jack_Collins injured a knee in the Washington_State game but insists he 'll be ready for Oklahoma . Last week , when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference 's top four in rushing , he said : `` That won't last long '' . It did n't ; Monday , he had four Longhorns in the top four .</context>
