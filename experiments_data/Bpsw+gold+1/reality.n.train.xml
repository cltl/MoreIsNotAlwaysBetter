      <context> If competition beats you to_it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in_store . On_the_other_hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive . As markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger . Is your R_+_D or product development program tuned in to the commercial <head>realities</head> of the market ? Are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R_+_D people ? Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it 's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash_register . Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution_costs ; and translate the whole into profit_and_loss and balance_sheet figures which management can act_on with some assurance ?</context>

      <context> Repeated polls have disclosed that most married_couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth_control . For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . This brings us to the fact that the <head>realities</head> we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief . Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil_law is concerned with public crimes . Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil_authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin . Among the chief victims of such an ill_conceived imposition would be religion itself .</context>

      <context> The Royal_Lao_Army , on_the other hand , was paid and equipped with American funds . In six years , U._S. aid had amounted to more_than $ 1.60 for each American - a total of three hundred million dollars . We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world 's giants . Even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new <head>reality</head> of grenades and submachine_guns ? To find_out , we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at_least , by the Royal_Lao_Army : from Attopeu , the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast , to Muong_Sing , the City of Lions in the northwest , close to Communist_China ( map , page 250 ) . We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly . We flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they did n't crash .</context>

      <context> Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi mechanistic powers . The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or_else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery . The image of God has simply disappeared . All such imitations of negative quality have given_rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love <head>reality</head> as it is , he can at_least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak_to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved . The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems . Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually_exclusive , that they belong together . Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being .</context>
