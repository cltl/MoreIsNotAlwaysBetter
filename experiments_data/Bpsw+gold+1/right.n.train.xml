      <context> In arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ; and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set_forth reasons to justify such a conviction . But the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable . This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition . If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the <head>right</head> to say anything at_all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian . Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus_Christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind - sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus - then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid . This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter . Modern man , as Dietrich_Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come_of_age '' ; and though this process by_no_means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in_fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .</context>

      <context> Hence , if what is in_question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a_little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded . Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on_the_one_hand , by the two at_least apparently self-consistent but mutually_exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on_the_other_hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann . A second point requires more extended comment . It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` <head>right</head> '' , as represented by Barth , rests_on the following thesis : The only tenable alternative to Bultmann 's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at_least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus_Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann 's point_of_view , are mythological .</context>

      <context> The plan called_for divestiture by du_Pont of its 63000000 shares of General_Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders , as a dividend , over a period of ten years . Christiana_Securities_Company and Delaware_Realty_+_Investment_Company , major stockholders in du_Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten year period , of du_Pont 's General_Motors stock allocable to them , as_well_as any General_Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright . If , in the trustee 's judgment , `` reasonable market conditions '' did not prevail during any given year , he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten year period . In_addition , the right_to_vote the General_Motors stock held by du_Pont was to be vested in du_Pont 's stockholders , other_than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware ; du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over General_Motors ; du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in_common with General_Motors , and vice_versa ; and General_Motors and du_Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided_for the purchase by General_Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du_Pont manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent_rights , or for a grant by General_Motors to du_Pont of a preferential <head>right</head> to make or sell any chemical discovery of General_Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial_enterprise by the two companies . On motion of the amici_curiae , the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner_of_Internal_Revenue as to the federal income_tax consequences of the Government 's plan . On May 9 , 1958 , the Commissioner announced his rulings . The annual dividends paid to du_Pont stockholders in shares of General_Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of du_Pont 's earnings and profits .</context>

      <context> Under its plan du_Pont would retain its General_Motors shares but be required to pass_on to its stockholders the right_to_vote those shares . Christiana and Delaware would , in_turn , be required to pass_on the voting_rights to the General_Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders . Du_Pont would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General_Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of du_Pont could serve as a director of General_Motors without court approval . Du_Pont would be denied the <head>right</head> to acquire any additional General_Motors stock except through General_Motors ' distributions of stock or subscription_rights to its stockholders . On June 6 , 1958 , General_Motors submitted its objections to the Government 's proposal . It argued , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both General_Motors and du_Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; that the tremendous volume of General_Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General_Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity . General_Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as_required by the mandate of_this Court .</context>

      <context> Although the standard_deviation values on which spread of the lines are based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . Third , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . It is convenient to classify a child 's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according_to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the <head>right</head> of the appropriate short transverse line . When a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classified according_to the position of the dot with_respect_to the vertical marking denoting the mean age . Such classifications may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , reserving `` moderate '' for dots upon or close to the mean .

      <context> There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister_of_the_Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less_than enthusiastic . Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the_French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious . From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government . Until the Charter_of_Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the <head>right</head> to assemble or to organize for political purposes . The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 , but the P.D.I. ( Parti_Democratique_de_l'Independance ) , the most important minor party at the time , objected to the Istiqlal 's predominance in the civil_service and influence in Radio_Maroc . There were rumors that the Ministry_of_the_Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings . The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be supported by the King himself .</context>

A week later the Daily_Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John_Brown on the day of his execution .
