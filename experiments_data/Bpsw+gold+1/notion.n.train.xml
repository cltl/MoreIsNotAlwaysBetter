      <context> If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people '' - and this , it must_not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task - there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation . This does not mean that mythological language as_such can no_longer be used in theology and preaching . The absurd <head>notion</head> that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann 's intention . His point is not that mythology may_not be used , but that it may no_longer be regarded_as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma . When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence . Mythological concepts may by_all_means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that_is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in non mythological ( or existential ) terms .</context>

      <context> At the nadir of that circuit is death . `` Along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience ; and disobedience to God entails death . Wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that [ moment ] they were handed_over to it '' . This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling <head>notion</head> that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a Friday , as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good_Friday ; he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath . In_any_case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead . The wages of sin is death . Man 's life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with God , must now be conformed_to the shape of death .</context>

      <context> And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at_least uncertain way on the details of how we behave . What elements of our behavior are decisive ? Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? We have staved_off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of_it , since we have not the slightest <head>notion</head> which parts are effective . I think that we are here also talking_of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city . If an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even_though he might not be able to act quickly enough . With the group of boys it is different .</context>

      <context> If an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even_though he might not be able to act quickly enough . With the group of boys it is different . He does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side . When confronted with a drunk or an insane person I have no <head>notion</head> of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others . I believe that what I do has some effect on his actions and I have learned , in_a_way , to commune with drunks , but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain_dance than the carrying_out of an experiment in physics . I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break_loose . Our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise .</context>

      <context> This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ; it is particularly the artist ( Tonio_Kro^ger , Aschenbach , Leverku^hn ) who suffers from it . The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough '' in the realm of art . Again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child . Finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) <head>notions</head> of dressing_up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with Cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann 's stories . We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates . For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody . Professionally a lawyer , that_is_to_say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed_up , disguised - that_is , paradoxically , revealed - as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child .</context>

Those familiar_with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 . And he describes it as a balanced polarity between the <head>notions</head> of the free individual and what he called the fundamental_law . I want to say more about Gabriel 's so-called fundamental_law . But first I want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in_this country and what happened to it . He points_out that from the time of Jackson on through World_War_1 , , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America .</context>

      <context> Moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920 s , the dislocations of the Depression , the common ethos of Materialism everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced Mike_Fink and the Great_Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the Little_People . However , it is important to trace the philosophy of the French_Revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former . That John_Locke 's philosophy of the social_contract fathered the American_Revolution with its Declaration_of_Independence , I believe , we generally accept . Yet , after Rousseau had given the social_contract a new twist with his <head>notion</head> of the General Will , the same philosophy , it may be said , became the idea source of the French_Revolution also . The importance of Rousseau 's twist has not always been clear to us , however . This notion of the General Will gave_rise to the Commune_of_Paris in the Revolution and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship . And it is clearly argued by Lord_Percy of Newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , The Heresy_of_Democracy , and in a more general way by Voegelin , in his New_Science_of_Politics , that this same Rousseauan idea , descending through European democracy , is the source of Marx 's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat .</context>

      <context> Is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ? Will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ?

      <context> False ideas surfeit another sector of our life . For several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship . The stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress . Children , conditioned by this mistaken <head>notion</head> , have feared stepmothers , while adults , by their antagonistic attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one . Debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild a happier one . Research , on_the_other_hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers . Helen_Deutsch informed us ( The_Psychology_of_Women , Vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many .</context>

      <context> Then , not many years later , the Un-American_Activities_Committee , under the leadership of Martin_Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens . Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government . This hysteria reached its height under the leadership of Senator_Joseph_McCarthy . Demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped <head>notions</head> . New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no_matter_how . Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency .

      <context> Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency . They give strict interpretation to William_James ' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself '' . They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as_soon_as he contacts something new . Hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every <head>notion</head> , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe . Despite this danger , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our finest tools ; they are priceless even_though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page ; they are the most valuable of commodities - and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply . So all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall_into two classes : those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others . Seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will keep the sheriff away '' .</context>

      <context> It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government . It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority . Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society . To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative_officials and judges - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that business be free from governmental supervision and <head>notions</head> of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with . Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society . Indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society . Government itself was based upon contract ; business_organization - the corporation - was analyzed in contractual terms ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement .</context>

      <context> But if that is true , why is any attitude more fitting than any other ? Would applause , for_example , be fitting if , apart from the applause , there were nothing good to applaud ? Would condemnation be fitting if , independently of the condemnation , there were nothing bad to condemn ? In such a case , any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other , which means that the <head>notion</head> of fitness has lost all point . Indeed we are forced to go much farther . If goodness and badness lie_in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them , those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line . If there is nothing evil in these things , if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them , why should n't they be greeted with a cheer ?</context>
