      <context> These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case . It might be contended , of_course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism . But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben_Gurion and set_forth in the indictment . In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have_to be tied to the <head>issue</head> by argument . One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages . Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell_into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism . Yes , he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of_course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; but he believed in the Jew as enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things .</context>

      <context> Dice rolled , prostitutes plied their trade , thieves stole , murderers stabbed , and the ungodly blasphemed . Catholics who were truly Christians longed for the simple penance of days gone_by . Libertines recalled the heroism of the past and demanded : `` Are we going_to allow the Protestant_Pope , Master_Calvin , to curtail our liberty ? Why , oh why , does n't he stick_to preaching the Gospel , instead of meddling in civic affairs , politics , economics , and social <head>issues</head> that are no concern of the Church '' ? And John 's reply was always the same : `` Anything that affects souls is the concern of the Church ! We will have righteousness '' ! Tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight .</context>
