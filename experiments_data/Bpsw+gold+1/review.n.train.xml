      <context> He again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in_addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties , and that he opposed war in any form . Thereafter he was classified 1_,_-_O . On April 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board . In a periodic <head>review</head> , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1_,_-_A and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home . Upon administrative approval of the reclassification , he was ordered to report for induction on June 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so . He was not prosecuted , however , and his case was subsequently reopened , in the light of Sicurella_v._United_States , 348_U._S._385_(_1955_) . He was again reclassified 1_,_-_A by the local board .</context>

      <context> The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history . Some weapons_systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development . Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon_system , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems . This has necessitated a continuous <head>review</head> and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons_systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_systems which have been overtaken by events . Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated . For_example , the importance of the Regulus_2 , , a very promising aerodynamic ship to surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic_missile launched by submerged submarines . Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long range interceptor with a speed three_times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid 1960 's .</context>
