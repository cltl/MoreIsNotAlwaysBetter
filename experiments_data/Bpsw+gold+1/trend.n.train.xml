      <context> Your competition is now proportionately greater - you are competing not_only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products . Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer 's dollar being spent on their particular products . Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying '' area ? The <head>trends</head> have been in_evidence for many years - population_shifts to the Southwest and Far_West , and from city to suburbs . These shifts will continue in the next 10 yr. . Have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in_terms_of sales_force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ? We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry - at both the manufacturing and retail ends .</context>

In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under_way during the first decade .

      <context> Of_course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy . Yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly . The meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother 's or grandmother 's standards . To many experts , this <head>trend</head> was inevitable . They consider it simply a sign of our times . Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority . It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role .</context>

      <context> Latin_America was once an area as `` safe '' for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon . Today it is up_for_grabs . One Latin_American country , Cuba , has become a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast . In some countries the <head>trend</head> has gone further than others : Mexico , Panama , and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism , and there is no country - save the Dominican_Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged - where Castroism and anti Americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause . Only in Europe have our lines remained_firm - and there only on the surface . The strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in England , and even in Germany .</context>

      <context> In a rapidly changing society congregations will run_into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more_than a single generation . The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of_this struggle to maintain economic balance . The expense of_this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development . It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two <head>trends</head> - expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings . These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis . Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions . The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; the schism between central_city and suburb , Negro and White , blue_collar and white_collar can be viewed_as symptomatic_of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis .</context>

      <context> Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several du_Pont products were actively promoted . Within a_few years various du_Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General_Motors ' eight operating divisions . The Fisher_Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting_trust even though General_Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from du_Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General_Motors divisions . Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General_Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this <head>trend</head> stemmed `` at_least in part '' from the needs of General_Motors outstripping du_Pont 's capacity . `` The fact that sticks_out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du_Pont 's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile_industry connected to du_Pont by a stock interest . The inference is overwhelming that du_Pont 's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit '' . 353_U._S._,_at_605 .</context>

      <context> Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 . New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) totals $ 4753 million , which is $ 1390 million below that enacted for 1960 . On_the_other_hand , the new authority of $ 3825 million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is $ 581 million higher than for 1960 . These contrasting <head>trends</head> in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed_Forces in the years ahead . The Department_of_Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items . As I have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known_as the Buy American Act . I urge once_again that the Congress not reenact this rider .</context>

      <context> However , the conversion from mass to size is unreliable , since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as * * f . To_what_extent such low_density applies to micrometeorites is unknown . The velocity value used is also open_to some question ; if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the Earth , only about one_third the above_mentioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass . Zodiacal_light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the <head>trend</head> of the smaller visible meteors . The diurnal_variation in the observed flux may be partly due_to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity . The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data . A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table 5 - 1 .</context>

      <context> Later , chlorothiazide and salt restriction became necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure . Because of increasing anemia , triamcinolone , 8 mg. daily , was started on Feb. 23 , 1958 , and was continued until july , 1958 . In september , 1958 , the patient developed generalized weakness and fatigue which was concurrent with exacerbation of his anemia ; the hemoglobin was 10.6 gm. . In an attempt to reverse the downhill <head>trend</head> by stimulating the bone_marrow and controlling any hemolytic component , triamcinolone , 16 mg. daily , was begun on Sept. 26 , 1958 , and continued until Feb. 18 , 1959 . At_first the patient felt stronger , and the hemoglobin rose to 13.8 gm. , but on Oct. 20 , 1958 , he complained of `` caving_in '' in his knees . By Nov. 8 , 1958 , weakness , specifically involving the pelvic and thigh musculature , was pronounced , and a common complaint was `` difficulty in stepping up on to curbs '' . Prednisone , 30 mg. daily , was substituted for triamcinolone from Nov. 22 until Dec. 1 , 1958 , without any improvement in the weakness .</context>

      <context> All the manuals for setting_up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the growth of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content . Furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys . Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded_as more hypothetical . While the U._S. Department_of_Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment <head>trends</head> and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning . The U._S. Office_of_Education continues to stress local surveys rather_than national surveys . This procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment . Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in_order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training_programs for those skills .</context>

Moreover , the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary . There simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in_demand and the types of training_programs that are required or most suitable . Much of the available information comes not from the Federal_government but from an exchange of experiences among states .</context>

      <context> If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states . However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment . Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent <head>trends</head> in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . This probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment_compensation or a Youth_Conservation_Corps . A maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from home . A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor .</context>

      <context> In most states , trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high_schools , usually located in the larger cities . In Arkansas fewer than 6 per_cent of the high_schools offer trade and industrial courses . In Illinois about 13 per_cent of the schools have programs , and in Pennsylvania 11 per_cent . An important recent <head>trend</head> is the development of area vocational_schools . For a number of years Kentucky , Louisiana and several other states have been building state sponsored vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties . These schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts . Transportation may be provided from nearby school districts .</context>

Courses are provided mainly for post high_school day programs ; but sometimes arrangements also are made for high_school students to attend , and evening extension courses also may be conducted . The Title 8 , program of the National_Defense_Education_Act of 1958 was a great spur to this <head>trend</head> toward area schools . By 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states .

A_few key skilled_workers experienced in the company 's type of work usually must be brought_in with the plant manager , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere .
