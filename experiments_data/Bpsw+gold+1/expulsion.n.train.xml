      <context> What of his treatment of the Jew in The_Merchant_of_Venice ? Shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of Shylock , but probably he never saw a Jew , unless in some of his travels .

If any had escaped <head>expulsion</head> by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place . Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays , but borrowed them from old stories , ballads , and plays , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark of life . Rather than from a first-hand study of Jewish people , his delineation of Shylock stems from a collection of Italian stories , Il_Pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier . He could learn at second_hand from books , but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit .</context>
