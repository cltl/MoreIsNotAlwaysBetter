      <context> It proposes the concept of a <head>“</head> Hierarchy of Attraction ” which , in simple terms , is just a stylized bell curve that illustrates how attractive people are relative to each other in terms of a percentile . Sociometric and perceived popularity are correlated but not equivalent . By combining these two concepts , Popularity Explained defines eight prototypical student types that can be plotted on the single graph .</context>

      <context> Individuals who have perceived popularity are often highly socially <head>visible</head> and frequently emulated but rarely liked . Since perceived popularity is a measure of visible reputation and emulation , this form of popularity is most openly discussed , agreed upon within a group , and what most people refer to when they call someone popular . To date , only one comprehensive theory of interpersonal popularity has been proposed : that of A. L. Freedman in the book Popularity Explained .</context>

And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in_proportion_to the growth of American influence across the world .

Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence .</context>

      <context> 2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness . Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account_for group_actions , to provide a focal_point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification . One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United_States in more recent years . The <head>popularity</head> of local color literature before the Spanish-American_War , the steady currency of the Lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass_media are cases_in_point . Nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of American life , that learned societies such_as the American_Folklore_Society and the American_Historical_Association were founded in the 1880's , or that courses in American literature , American civilization , American anything have swept our school and college curricula . Of_course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth century United_States . Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man_in_the_street .</context>

      <context> As_long_as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further . Motion-picture exhibitions took_place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny_arcade which can still be found in such urban_areas as Times_Square . Brief snips of actual events were shown : parades , dances , street scenes . The sensational and frightening enjoyed <head>popularity</head> : a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats . An early Edison production was The_Execution_of_Mary_Queen_of_Scotts . The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold ; the headsman swung his axe ; the head dropped off ; end of film .</context>

      <context> The two events are taking_place at_the_same_time . Time and space have both become cinematic . We leap from event to event - including the formation of the posse - even though the events , in `` reality '' are taking_place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance . The `` chase '' as a standard film device probably dates_from The_Great_Train_Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued <head>popularity</head> of the device . The chase in itself is a narrative ; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting - both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not_only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; these films and these sequences are also seeking_out - instinctively or by_design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative .</context>

      <context> The lordly poet was at low-water_mark . The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent . On all sides doors were being slammed in his face . The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his <head>popularity</head> . Now , under the impact of his wife 's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be . He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half_sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted_in would involve them in a common ruin . For_the_moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity .</context>
