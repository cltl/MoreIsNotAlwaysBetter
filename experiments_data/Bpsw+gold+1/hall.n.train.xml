Oh he 'd not care about the Pedersen kid . He 'd not care about getting waked so he could give_up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding_places in_the_bargain .

The <head>hall</head> was empty and Alex beckoned ; they climbed the stairs which creaked , very_loudly to their sensitive ears , and reached the next floor . A guest was locking his room ; they passed behind him and got to Alex 's room unnoticed . The doctor sat_down rather wearily , caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry loving man , but no_sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once_more . At the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille_de_chambre to return in ten minutes .</context>

They waited three minutes and_then crept out on tip-toe ; the <head>halls</head> were empty and they passed down_the_stairs to number nine and listened at the door . A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille_de_chambre 's presence inside ; they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact . The doctor shot_down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory was occupied . Although a look of alarm passed_over his face , he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower_room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine .</context>

The ME 's boys had finished their on-the-spot examination and the body had been removed for autopsy . The meat wagon , therefore , was not out in_front of the house any_more , but the cluster of squad_cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings .
