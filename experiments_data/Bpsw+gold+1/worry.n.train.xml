      <context> Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act . To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition . But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating . The frequently postulated antique <head>worry</head> that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave_rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize . It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter_solstice . This and other fears of the solar_system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic_system and its built-in concept of periodicity and_then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions . This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .</context>

      <context> It will be good_for_you . I think , too '' , he said , his dark eyes mischievous , `` that you will find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you have spoken '' . Within two_weeks Warren was ringing the bell at the abbey gate . The monk who opened the door immediately calmed his <head>worries</head> about his reception : `` I speak English '' , the old_man said , `` but I do not hear it very_well '' . He smiled and stuck a large finger with white hairs sprouting on_it into his ear as though that might help . Smiling at Warren 's protestations , the old monk took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor . `` Will you please wait in here .</context>

      <context> That was one of the high spots of the play . The audience , as_usual , loved it . He was delighted to see them so happy . If he had any <head>worries</head> , it was only the small ones , about Mother in New_York , and his daughter Edwina and what she might be doing at this hour , with her Aunt_Asia , in Philadelphia . Everyone is ambivalent about his profession , if he has practised it long enough , but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen people out there , who might cheer you or boo you , but that was largely , though not entirely , up_to_you . They made the world seem friendly somehow , though he knew it was not . Wilkes was quite right about one thing .</context>

      <context> He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college . He loved them . It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known . Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his handicap , his irons , his stance , his opponents , and his weather in_detail , but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business <head>worries</head> . His money was tied_up in a Nassau hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been running against him . His worries harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window . In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves .</context>

      <context> On the right window , at eye level , in smaller print but also in gold , was Gonzalez , Prop. , and under_that , Se_Habla_Espanol . Mr._Phillips took a razor to Gonzalez , Prop. , but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele would be welcome . Language was no problem anyway ; Mr._Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of Mission_Street . Aside from the fact that business was slow this time_of_year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising , Mr._Phillips had no <head>worries</head> at_all , and he said as much to Gun_Matson , who sat across from him in civilian clothes , on a Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed , mauve velour , $ 79.89 nothing down special ! `` She 's honest_as_the_day '' , Mr._Phillips said , and added , `` Mr._Gunnar , I can say this to you : Beebe is a_little too honest . You can n't tell a customer how much it 's going_to cost him to refinance his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down ! A time_plan is a mere convenience , you understand , and when '' - He interrupted himself , smiling .</context>
