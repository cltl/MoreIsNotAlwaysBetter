      <context> 2 . Heat transfer by molecular conduction as_well_as by radiation from the arc column . The heat transfer to the anode in free_burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas_jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up **f . This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated in_detail by Maecker ( <head>Ref.</head> 1 ) . The pressure gradient producing the jet is_due to the nature of the magnetic_field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) . Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free_burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point . it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free_burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode .</context>

Feed_back of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode . The third method was , to our knowledge , successfully applied for_the_first_time by C._Sheer and co-workers ( <head>Ref.</head> 2 ) . The purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as_well_as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage . Gas injection through a porous anode ( transpiration cooling ) not_only feeds_back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself . A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper .</context>

      <context> Sintered porous metals should be usable in_principle . However , technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots . The experimental arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free_burning arcs . Thus , direct comparisons can be drawn with free_burning arcs which have been studied in_detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( <head>Ref.</head> 3 ) . Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder . The cathode consisted_of a 1/4 '' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water_cooled copper tube . This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing .</context>

      <context> The O atoms in each sheet are close_packed and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of O atoms . The **f layers are stacked normal to the [ 111 ] axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers . The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen_bonds . A drawing of the structure is to be_found in <head>reference</head> 6 . The gross details of the structure appear reasonable . The structure appears to be unique among ROOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by **f . The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal .</context>

The small amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting_buffer , centrifuged , resuspended in 2.5 ml of isotonic saline and tested for antibody activity . The chromatography was done at 6 ` C using gradient elution , essentially according_to Sober and Peterson . The deep concave gradient employed ( fig. 2 ) was obtained with a nine chambered gradient elution device ( `` Varigrad '' , <head>reference</head> ( 8 ) ) and has been described elsewhere . the other , a shallow concave gradient ( Fig. 1 ) , was produced with a so-called `` cone sphere '' apparatus , the `` cone '' being a 2 - liter Erlenmeyer_flask and the `` sphere , '' a 2 - liter round-bottom flask . Each initially contained 1700 ml of buffer ; in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer , 0.50 M in both * * f and Tris , pH 4.1 . A flow_rate of 72 * * f was used and 12 ml fractions were collected .</context>

      <context> The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 ) . Whether this abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH , or is , alternatively , normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible_for the blood activity with pituitary TSH . In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them . The introduction of the United_States_Pharmacopoeia <head>reference</head> standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid stimulating activity have made_it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time . We should_like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in_terms_of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units . For_the_most_part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard . The international unit ( u . ) , adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different laboratories ( Mussett and Perry , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the International_Standard_Preparation .</context>
