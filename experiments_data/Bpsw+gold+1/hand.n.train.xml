Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress . It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2 .</context>

But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at_work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another . Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype - a `` How are you now '' ? or an `` I want to go_home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning . A hebephrenic man used_to give a repetitious wave of his <head>hand</head> a number of times during his largely silent hours with his therapist .

He could not see objects as unified , self-contained , and organized figures , as a person does with normal vision . The meaning of_this , as we shall see , is that he had no fund of visual memory-images of objects as objects ; and , therefore , he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again . Instead , he constantly became lost in parts and components of them , confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects , and_so_on , unless he allowed time to `` trace '' the object in_question through minute movements of the head and <head>hands</head> and in this way to discover its contours . According_to his own testimony , he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots '' of color of a more_or_less indefinite size ; at their edges they slipped pretty_much out_of_focus altogether . But by the tracing procedure , he could , in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner , find the unseen form ; could piece , as_it_were , the jumbled mass together into an organized whole and_then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned_out to be .

He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at_a_time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a_little and his breath came hard through his nicotine choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate_Gallery on a Thursday once .

She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting_to be . She fell_asleep leaning_on her <head>hand</head> , hearing the house creaking as_though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm . Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers . Then she fell_asleep again as suddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes . She stood_up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming_in or going_out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in_a_moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests .</context>
