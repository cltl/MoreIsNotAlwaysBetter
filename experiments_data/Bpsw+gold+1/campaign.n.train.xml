The coalition was to prove inadvisable . O_'_Banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright_blue eyes stared with a kind_of frozen candour into others ' . He had a round , frank Irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in_place even when he was pumping bullets into someone 's body .</context>

      <context> Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep_abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength . If we look_at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev 's nightmarish worries - or , at_least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage . The other charge was that America 's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years . The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the <head>campaign</head> , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world_affairs can quarrel with it . The argument was typically advanced in_terms_of U._S. `` prestige '' . Prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ; and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading . Prestige is a measure of how other people think_of you , well or ill .</context>

Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be . The thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it . The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United_States is weaker than the Soviet_Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead .</context>

      <context> When some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for_instance , we do not turn_to free and open discussion as in a political_campaign . We have recourse to the scientifically trained specialist in the laboratory . The merits of the Salk anti polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children . Our presidential <head>campaigns</head> provide much debate and argument . But is the result new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with_confidence solve our domestic and international problems ? Man , we are told , is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad . But what a super Herculean task it is to winnow anything of value from the mud_beplastered arguments used so freely , particularly since such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes , in themselves declarations of intellectual bankruptcy .</context>
