      <context> A story , no_doubt apocryphal , for Mercer himself denies it , has him sporting a monocle in those Village days . Though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade_mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers . One day in a bar , so the legend goes , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monocle and broke it . The innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of <head>honor</head> found in bars , insisted upon replacing the destroyed monocle - and did , over the protests of the former owner - with a square monocle . Mercer is_supposed_to have refused it with , `` Anyone who wears a square monocle must be affected '' ! Everett_Miller , then assistant director for the Garrick_Gaieties , a Theatre_Guild production , needed a lyricist for a song he had written ; he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however . For him Mercer produced the lyric to `` Out_of_Breath_Scared_to_Death_of_You '' , introduced in that most successful of all the Gaieties , by Sterling_Holloway .</context>
