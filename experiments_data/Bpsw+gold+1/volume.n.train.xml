      <context> The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C._Virgil_Martin , president of Carson_Pirie_Scott_+_Co. , committee chairman . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend_upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The <head>volume</head> of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' . Other recommendations made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity .</context>

      <context> Is your R_+_D or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ? Are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R_+_D people ? Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it 's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash_register . Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; who can develop reliable estimates of sales <head>volume</head> , production , and distribution_costs ; and translate the whole into profit_and_loss and balance_sheet figures which management can act_on with some assurance ? We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans - and management could n't make_up_its_mind . There is a shortage of salesmen today . In the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still .</context>

      <context> Du_Pont would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General_Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of du_Pont could serve as a director of General_Motors without court approval . Du_Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General_Motors stock except through General_Motors ' distributions of stock or subscription_rights to its stockholders . On June 6 , 1958 , General_Motors submitted its objections to the Government 's proposal . It argued , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both General_Motors and du_Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; that the tremendous <head>volume</head> of General_Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General_Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity . General_Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as_required by the mandate of_this Court . The decrees proposed by the amici_curiae were filed in August of 1958 . These plans , like du_Pont 's contained provisions for passing the vote on du_Pont 's General_Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their spouses , and other people living in their households , as_well_as other specified persons , were to be totally disenfranchised .</context>

      <context> It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made . The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined . However , the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic considerations alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse . The <head>volume</head> and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse . Also , interlobular air drifts may be all_but nonexistent in the cow ; probably occur in the horse much_as in the human_being ; and , in contrast are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent ( Van_Allen and Lindskog , ' 31 ) . A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at_present . Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as_well .</context>

      <context> At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India , Brazil , the Philippines , and Taiwan , which are ready and committed to move_into the stage of self-sustaining growth . They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups . But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies . On the economic front , the first priority of these countries is to mobilize a vastly increased <head>volume</head> of resources . Several related tasks must be carried_out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved . These countries must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy . They must in their planning be able to count_on at_least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years .</context>

      <context> The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc. . A significant reduction in the <head>voume</head> of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such_as Russian . For English the reduction in size is less striking . This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary_entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word . The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file .</context>

      <context> Wavy lines , feather like patterns , rosettes of indefinitely floral nature , birds either singly or in stylized rows , animals in solemn frieze bands ( see Plates 11 - 12 ) - all these turned_up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze . The rows of animals and birds , in_particular , suggest awareness of Oriental animal friezes , transmitted perhaps via Syrian silver bowls and textiles , but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless Greek . Though the spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not_yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the Cyclades , which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century . As the material at the command of the potters grew and the <head>volume</head> of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident . Plate 12 illustrates four examples , which are Ripe or Late_Geometric work of common spirit but of different schools .</context>

      <context> Some retailing , of_course , always spreads with the population - grocery_stores , drugstores , local haberdasheries and dress_shops , candy_stores and the_like . But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago - a new bedroom_set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior - the family set_off for the downtown department_store , where the selection would be greatest . Department_stores congregated in the `` one_hundred per_cent location '' , where all the transit_lines converged . These stores are still there , but the <head>volume</head> of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more_and_more dry_goods . If the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar_volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put_in the bank . In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated . No suburban shopping-center branch - not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store .</context>

Telephone_orders distort the picture : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather_than a central city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminates city sales_tax . The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened .</context>

      <context> The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in selecting his plant site . Until internal_combustion became cheap , he had_to be near a railroad_siding and a trolley_line or an existing large community of lower-class homes . The railroad_siding is still important - it is usually , though not always , true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper than trucking . But anybody who promises a substantial <head>volume</head> of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad . And there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking_lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush_hour traffic and grille route bus_lines , is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory . Willow_Run , General_Electric 's enormous installations at Louisville and Syracuse , the Pentagon , Boeing in Seattle , Douglas and Lockheed in Los_Angeles , the new automobile assembly plants everywhere - none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass_rapid_transit . They are all suburban plants , relying_on the roads to keep them supplied with workers .</context>
