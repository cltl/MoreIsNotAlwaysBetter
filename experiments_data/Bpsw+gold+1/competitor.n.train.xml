      <context> Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . `` I knew it all_along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . For a serious young_man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense_of_humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings . Yet he remains the fiercest of <head>competitors</head> . He 'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he 's right . That 's how he first won the Masters in 1958 . It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155 - yarder .</context>

      <context> The music is always allowed the living_space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi performer . The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance . All_of this would be wasted , of_course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction . For me it has more of both elements than the majority of its <head>competitors</head> . Steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms set_down on_paper . Those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one . Without losing the distinctive undertow of Brahmsian rhythm , the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly_knit quality that makes_for maximum cumulative effect .</context>

      <context> Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life . ( An enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days . Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries . ) In most sports , as in most walks_of_life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the Russian <head>competitor</head> of 16 has at_least thirteen years of training behind him . The American is very lucky if he has three . If a nation wished to get a head_start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large_number of the problems that plague American schools . First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both .</context>

      <context> a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats . An early Edison production was The_Execution_of_Mary_Queen_of_Scotts . The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold ; the headsman swung his axe ; the head dropped off ; end of film . An early film by a <head>competitor</head> of the Wizard of Menlo_Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage . In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large_numbers from the simple-minded , one minute shows . In response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion_picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day . Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at_heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short_story .</context>

      <context> Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several du_Pont products were actively promoted . Within a_few years various du_Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General_Motors ' eight operating divisions . The Fisher_Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting_trust even though General_Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from du_Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General_Motors divisions . <head>Competitors</head> came to receive higher percentage of General_Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend stemmed `` at_least in part '' from the needs of General_Motors outstripping du_Pont 's capacity . `` The fact that sticks_out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du_Pont 's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile_industry connected to du_Pont by a stock interest . The inference is overwhelming that du_Pont 's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit '' . 353_U._S._,_at_605 .</context>

      <context> 353_U._S._,_at_605 . This Court agreed with the trial_court `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not overlooked by either du_Pont or General_Motors '' . 353_U._S._,_at_606 . However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including du_Pont 's <head>competitors</head> '' , 353_U._S._,_at_607 , outweighed the Government 's claim for relief . This claim , as submitted to the District_Court and dismissed by it , 126_F._Supp .235 , alleged violation not_only of 7 of the Clayton_Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman_Act . The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations .</context>

      <context> Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision . Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du_Pont and General_Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his <head>competitors</head> from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute . We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints . The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition '' . 353_U._S._,_at_607 .</context>
