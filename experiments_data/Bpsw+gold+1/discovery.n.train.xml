      <context> Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left . With Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host 's fertile but disorganized mind . Oersted remodeled Ritter 's notes into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut_de_France for its annual prize of 3000 francs . The sound <head>discoveries</head> of_this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him . In May , 1803 , Ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy . He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries . Thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` Leiden '' jar by Kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of Volta , and 1801 the voltaic_pile .</context>

      <context> She liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up . `` Very few wives '' , says Dr._Calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going_to become submissive where sex is concerned . A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual_relationship as_well '' . And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive - the comparatively recent <head>discovery</head> of the true depths of female desire and response . Marriage manuals and women 's magazine_articles began to stress the importance of the female climax . They began to describe in_detail the woman 's capacity for response . In_fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , Dr._Albert_Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men .</context>

      <context> After three weeks ' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas . The ship halted . The great `` sea to the westwards '' was a dead_end . This must have been Hudson 's blackest <head>discovery</head> . For he seemed to sense at_once that before him was no South_Sea , but the solid bulk of the North_American continent . This was the bitter_end , and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure . Feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition .</context>

      <context> Twice he had failed , and the Muscovy_Company indicated it would not back him again . In 1609 , the Dutch_East_India_Company hired Hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the Half_Moon , and supplied him with Dutch sailors . This time he turned westward , to the middle_Atlantic coast of North_America . His chief <head>discovery</head> was important - the Great_North ( later , the Hudson ) River - but it produced no northwest passage . When the Half_Moon put in at Dartmouth , England , in the fall of 1609 , word of Hudson 's findings leaked_out , and English interest in him revived . The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship . He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth .</context>

      <context> Among the recipients of the Nobel_Prize for Literature more_than half are practically unknown to readers of English . Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding <head>discoveries</head> than Verner_von_Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago . Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present . In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as_much_as_possible speak_for himself . Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family .</context>

      <context> But neither was the statement empirical , for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard . What were they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value ? To find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory was what they regarded_as their most important <head>discovery</head> . It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only . If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at_all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like `` Hurrah '' or `` Fiddlesticks '' , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at_rest . This is the course the positivists took .</context>

      <context> McFeeley told the parents he would escort them to police_headquarters in a half hour . Before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbors . He did not want_to bring the Andruses to the station_house too early - Rheinholdt had summoned a press_conference , and he did n't want them subjected to the reporters again . He could think_of nothing else to tell them : no assurances , no hopeful hints at great <head>discoveries</head> that day . When the detective left , Andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project . Mrs._Andrus was talking to the maid , arranging for her to come in every_day , instead of the four days she now worked . Outside , only a handful of reporters remained .</context>

      <context> The expedition that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words . The description of the Siddo syntax was very restricted . And , as Hal found_out , obviously mistaken in many cases . This <head>discovery</head> caused Hal anxiety . His duty was to write a school_text and to teach the entire personnel of the Gabriel how to speak Ozagen . Yet , if he used all_of the little means at his disposal , he would be instructing his students wrongly . Moreover , even getting this across would be difficult .</context>

      <context> We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted . It may have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it did n't prevent the paintings from being exciting . He also had , at_times , an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker ; he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For_Christ's_sake , Donald , you 've got Prussian_blue all_over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all_over his pants as_well . Mrs._Monmouth thought_of him as her <head>discovery</head> , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting . It was all gravy , and Donald did n't need much to live_on ; none of us did . We shared the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap lodgings of one kind or another . Attending the life_class was my idea - or rather , Askington 's idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two would n't have gone if I had n't talked them into it .</context>
