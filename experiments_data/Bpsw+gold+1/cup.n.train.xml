      <context> The <head>cup</head> is a unit of measurement for volume , used in cooking to measure liquids ( fluid measurement ) and bulk foods such as granulated sugar ( dry measurement ) . It is principally used in the United States and Liberia where it is a legally defined unit of measurement . Actual cups used in a household in any country may differ from the cup size used for recipes ; standard measuring cups , often calibrated in fluid measure and weights of usual dry ingredients as well as in cups , are available .</context>
