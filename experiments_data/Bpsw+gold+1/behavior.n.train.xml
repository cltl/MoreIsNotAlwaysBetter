      <context> Its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the English_professor with whom one attends the theatre . The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of English_professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor_cars , political candidates , or female beauty . Along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than I have seen . In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal <head>Behavior</head> the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon_Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human_beings and events . But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap . I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth . I use this term to mean three things : a search for the human significance of an event or state_of_affairs , a tendency to look_at wholes rather_than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling .</context>

      <context> Success in observing these spectral lines has so_far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ; extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported . Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals . The Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 * * f . The efforts and accomplishments fall_into three main categories : absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the <head>behavior</head> of germanium resistors , and helium 4 vapor-pressure measurements ( see p. 144 ) . An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the thermometric fluid , to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 * * f . Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute_temperature measurement , and may be used as_an_alternative to the gas_thermometer . When values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium 4 vapor_pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found .</context>

      <context> A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation_period of most infectious_diseases . Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such_as large cities . An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an aerosol or cloud of agent over the target_area . This concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the <head>behavior</head> of particulate biological materials , the pathogenesis of respiratory infections , the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence . The biological and physical_properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years . Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics . Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assessment techniques .</context>

      <context> There may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such_as widespread contamination of kitchens , restaurants , food stores , hospitals , etc. . Depending_on the organism , there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products , i.e. , in milk for_example . The secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense . Something of the <head>behavior</head> of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field_trials : In the first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological_conditions . Zinc_cadmium_sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were disseminated . This material fluoresces under ultraviolet_light which facilitates its sampling and assessment .</context>

      <context> The particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles . From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34000 square_miles was covered . These dosages could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case . The <head>behavior</head> of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field_trial conducted with a non pathogenic organism . An aqueous suspension of the spores of B. subtilis , var. niger , generally known as Bacillus_globigii , was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles . A satisfactory cloud was produced even_though these nozzles were only about 5 per_cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns . In this test , 130 gallons of a suspension , having a count of * * f organisms per ml , or a total of approximately * * f spores , was aerosolized .</context>

      <context> The actual mean of 1.07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement .

Thomas ' findings are , first , `` that the individual items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence '' ; but , second , `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence '' ( as between M-K and I-E . His first conclusion , on <head>behavior</head> of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on Ath. and Yok . ) was partially positive . His second conclusion , on semantic word_classes , agrees with mine . This second conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored . Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence , which weights not_only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative_frequency .</context>

      <context> If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per_cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per_cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller . And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones . It is evident that Swadesh has not_only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable <head>behavior</head> of lexical items . Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list ? It is the urge to obtain a list as free_of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible . And why that insistence ?</context>

      <context> When now we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these differences : * * f This distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart : * * f ; which , divided by * * f gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart . If the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families , the distance would of_course be 0 . If it were wholly random and unrelated , it would be 2.0 , assuming the five classes were equal in n , which approximately they are .
