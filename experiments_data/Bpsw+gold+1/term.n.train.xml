      <context> State_Party_Chairman_James_W._Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking_up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen._John_Tower will be the featured speaker . In the Blue_Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting_precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according_to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more <head>term</head> to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system - a system which the party opposes in its platform . Sam_Caldwell , State_Highway_Department public_relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd 's campaign .</context>

      <context> In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers_game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat . He has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future . He is a Buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not_only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung . U_Thant of_course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when Mr._Hammarskjold 's <head>term</head> would have come to an end . Whether the compromises - on both sides - that made_possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen . Mr._Khrushchev 's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ; the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U_Thant represents . In_a_sense , the showdown promised by Mr._Hammarskjold 's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; no precedents have been set as_yet ; structurally , the U.N. is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing_to_bear upon it .</context>

Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? Every single problem touched_on thus_far is related to good marketing planning . `` Hip-pocket '' tactics are going_to be harder to apply .</context>
