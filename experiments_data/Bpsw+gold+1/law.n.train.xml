In the province of Ontario , for example , the licensing process for the Law Society of Upper Canada ( Ontario 's governing law society ) consists of three mandatory components : The Skills and Professional Responsibility Program with assignments and assessments , Licensing Examinations ( a Barrister Licensing Examination and a Solicitor Licensing Examination ) , and a 10-month Articling term.[1 ]</context>

      <context> Recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction . He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as_well_as of mortality . Therefore Irenaeus describes man 's creation as_follows : `` So_that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted_up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take_up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a <head>law</head> was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all . And He laid_down for him certain conditions : so_that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' . These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result . There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) .</context>

      <context> In_general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical . This development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National_Council_of_Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the US . The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family_planning . It called_for opposition to <head>laws</head> and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives . The general board declared : `` Most_of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .

An action once universally condemned by all Christian_churches and forbidden by the civil_law is now not_only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant_denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty .</context>

      <context> This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country . Repeated polls have disclosed that most married_couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth_control . For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of <head>law</head> and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief . Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil_law is concerned with public crimes . Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil_authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin .</context>

      <context> Pope_Pius_12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long_time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such_as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications '' . This means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring .

      <context> As is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula . Prior to 1960 , in_order to provide matching for the minimum ( base ) allotment , State funds had to equal 1954 State funds . Prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related_to the fiscal capacity of the State , with a pivot of 40 % State ( or 60 % Federal ) participation in total program costs . The percentage of Federal participation in such costs for any State is referred to in the <head>law</head> as that State 's `` Federal share '' . For purposes of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the States `` unadjusted Federal share '' . Beginning in 1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as_required ) 25 % a_year , so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40 % pivot State share , with maximum and minimum State shares of 50 % and 30 % , respectively . The pre 1960 rate of Federal participation with_respect_to any State 's base allotment , as_well_as the adjusted rate in_effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is designated by the statute as that State 's `` adjusted Federal Share '' .</context>

      <context> Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the <head>law</head> as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services . Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry_out the provisions of the Act . The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational_rehabilitation_program , providing_for a three part grant structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational_rehabilitation - and in_addition for short-term training and instruction .</context>

      <context> There were rumors that the Ministry_of_the_Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings . The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be supported by the King himself . The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called_in and notices of further investigation appeared from_time_to_time . In January , 1958 , the Minister_of_the_Interior announced that an election <head>law</head> was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied . In late 1957 the M.P. ( Mouvement_Populaire ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council_of_Government under Balafrej was formed without support from progressive elements in the party .

It is true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , inhibited the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy . <head>Law</head> was seen as an emanation of the `` sovereign will '' . However , the sovereign was not Hobbes ' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin . It was , too , an optimistic philosophy , and , though it separated law from morality , it was by_no_means an immoral or amoral one . Man , through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny .</context>

It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action .</context>

The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted . The readers of the Providence_Daily_Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old_Brown '' had a fair trial . Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her <head>laws</head> , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' . In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical . J._Wheaton_Smith , editor of the Warren_Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in_order_that all those misnamed philantropists [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' .
