      <context> If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . The world 's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening <head>round</head> of the Los_Angeles_open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . He boomed a 280 - yard drive . Then the pixies and the zombies took_over while the banshees wailed in the distance . On the narrow fairway of a 508 - yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot .</context>

      <context> As_soon_as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken_over , cut it off from the mother plant . A second and also good practice is to shear off the tops , leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch . These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring . I like to shear half my plants at_a_time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second_half is getting_started on its new <head>round</head> of blooming . Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed . Nature 's aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation . That done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant .</context>

      <context> Sporting firearms change , markedly for the better . Just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered_wagon , the demand of today 's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment . The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle_loader and slow firing single shot arms with modern fast firing autoloaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide_action firearms . And millions of <head>rounds</head> of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today 's hunting and target shooting . And due_to modern resource use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever expanding encroachment on land and water . Present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural_resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped . Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more_than 40 states , on shooting_preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game management ) for five and six months each_year .</context>

      <context> We were told that to the Pathet_Lao , a kidnaped American was worth at_least $ 750 , a fortune in Laos . Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had spurned an escort . Now Pathet_Lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil American intervention . Although we enjoyed our <head>rounds</head> of the government_offices in Vientiane , with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in French , we were getting nowhere . We had nearly decided that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the Prime_Minister . Could we be ready in 15_minutes ? His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go_out of town , and he was eager to be off .</context>

      <context> We can escape_from such a difficulty by ruling_out the animal as not constituting a trial , but such a solution is not always satisfactory . Each die has probability * * f of producing an ace ; the marksman has some probability p , perhaps 0.1 , of making a bull's-eye . Note that we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial . During a <head>round</head> of target_practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles the marksman , lowering his chance of a bull's-eye . Strictly_speaking , this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials . Thus in the three dice example * * f , * * f , and the independence assumption implies that the probability that the three dice fall ace , not ace , ace in that order is ( 1 6 ) ( 5 6 ) ( 1 6 ) . Experimentally , we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another .</context>

      <context> Fortunately , a general formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind . Before deriving this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind '' . Experiments are often composed of several identical trials , and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated . In the marksmanship example , a trial consists_of `` one <head>round</head> shot at a target '' with outcome either one bull's-eye ( success ) or none ( failure ) . Further , an experiment might consist_of five rounds , and several sets of five rounds might be regarded_as a super experiment composed of several repetitions of the five round experiment . If three dice are tossed , a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials . Or , what amounts to the same thing , if one die is tossed three times , each toss is a trial , and the three tosses form the experiment .</context>

      <context> The binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another . We devote a chapter to the binomial_distribution not_only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real_life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that recur in many other probability models . We begin with a_few examples of binomial experiments . A trained marksman shooting five <head>rounds</head> at a target , all under practically the same conditions , may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times . In repeated sets of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary . What can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes ? In litters of eight mice from similar parents , the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer from 0 to 8 .</context>
