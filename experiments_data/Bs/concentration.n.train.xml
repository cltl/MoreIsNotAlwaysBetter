      <context> An enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live '' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance . About that same time John_Crosby 's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing_space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do . In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods . The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense <head>concentration</head> on the music . Cameras stared at soloists ' faces in extreme closeups , then considerately pulled_back for full views of ensemble work . `` Chicago and All_That_Jazz '' could not be faulted on the choice of artists . Some of the in-person performers were Jack_Teagarden , Gene_Krupa , Bud_Freeman , Pee_Wee_Russell , Johnny_St._Cyr , Joe_Sullivan , Red_Allen , Lil_Armstrong , Blossom_Seeley .</context>

( Note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin_point <head>concentration</head> of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) . In the third Push-Pull_Super-Set the `` push '' exercise is the wide grip Pushup_Between_Bars , while the `` pull '' exercise is the Moon_Bench_Lateral_Raise with bent arms . The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral rib_cage stretcher ever invented !

      <context> The minimum total potential_energy is found by taking the derivative with_respect_to H and equating to zero . This gives * * f , which is the pressure . This is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential_energy for equilibrium . This method can be extended to include the <head>concentration</head> differences caused by shear fields . The relation between osmotic_pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way . In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics_of_equilibrium ( referred to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady state .

      <context> Note that the mass scale is one to two orders_of_magnitude greater than some previously used ; for_example , Jacchia ( 1948 ) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a * * f , zero magnitude meteorite . The older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic_energy into light . The mass scale used in Table 5 - 1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related_to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 ) . A <head>concentration</head> distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 ) . Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites . The approximate equation is * * f , where n is the number of * * f with electron line density greater than or equal to * * f , and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite .

      <context> Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar corpuscular_radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . Further , the corpuscular_radiation , i.e. , the solar_wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive_force to the gravitational_force . The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi major_axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor_axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . Also , planetary gravitational_attraction increases the dust <head>concentration</head> near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . At one astronomical_unit from the sun ( the Earth 's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about * * f km of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic_energy less than their potential_energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . De_Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more_and_more eccentric without changing the semi major_axis .</context>

The observational data determining the <head>concentration</head> distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region .

The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 ) . Whether this abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH , or is , alternatively , normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible_for the blood activity with pituitary TSH . In evaluating data on the <head>concentration</head> of TSH in blood , one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them . The introduction of the United_States_Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid stimulating activity have made_it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time . We should_like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in_terms_of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units . For_the_most_part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard .</context>

      <context> Since the circulating thyroid_hormones are the amino_acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine ( cf. Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid_gland for their release from proteins before secretion . The presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid . One of the proteases has pH optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 ( McQuillan , Stanley and Trikojus , 1954 ; Alpers , Robbins and Rall , 1955 ) . The finding that the <head>concentration</head> of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid_glands from TSH treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in_vivo . There is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known . A study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediates ( Alpers , Petermann and Rall , 1956 ) . Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes .</context>

      <context> It has been suggested that the plasma thyroxine binding proteins , which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine , compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ( Ingbar and Freinkel , 1957 ) . Antithyroid drugs are of two general types . One type has a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate perchlorate fluoroboride type . This ion inhibits thyroid_hormone synthesis by interfering with iodide <head>concentration</head> in the thyroid . It does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as_such . The other group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil . These drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism , but they inhibit organification .</context>

      <context> The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a_few thick walled cells in the xylem region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors . A study of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm . Wound_tumor_virus is a leafhopper transmitted virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation ( Black , 1944 ; Brakke et_al. , 1954 ) . The <head>concentration</head> and apparent localization of the WTV antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in_order_to infect plants .</context>

      <context> Both parties and the Ministry_of_the_Interior were busily at_work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance . Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation . The general setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization . The <head>concentration</head> of effective power in Rabat leads not_only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in_addition to contributing to more meaningful elections . Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber_of_Commerce elections , which took_place three weeks before national elections . The Istiqlal sponsored U.M.C.I.A. ( L'Union_Marocaine_des_Commercants , Industrialistes_et_Artisans ) was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P. ( L'Union_National_des_Forces_Populaires ) in nearly all urban_centers . As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen , the U.M.C.I.A. was generally favored against the more progressive , labor based U.N.F.P. The newer party campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small_businessmen to support them as they had done for many years .</context>

      <context> In the midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . The high cost of land and a_few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . Research at Fayette_, Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg / l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb BOD / day / acre . Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD <head>concentrations</head> , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen / hr / hp . O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes .</context>

      <context> It was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and corrected , but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen . A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate . Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover . The rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 - mg / l dissolved oxygen <head>concentration</head> and 10 ` C for various rotor speeds is given in Table 3 , . The maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 mg / l dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lb / day at a maximum rate of 9.3 mg / l / hr . The actual power requirements indicated 2 lb oxygen transfer / hr / hp . The polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per_cent , indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather_than through the surface .</context>
