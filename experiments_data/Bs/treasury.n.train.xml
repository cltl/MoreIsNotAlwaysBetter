      <context> But hear Harrison_E._Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The_New_York_Times , and author of `` To_Moscow_-_And_Beyond '' . In a book review of `` The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State_Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West_Contacts_Staff in_order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy_and_Bess ' overrode the State_Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz_musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo_montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry_Ford , Hugh_Cooper , Thomas_Campbell , the International_Harvester_Co. , and David_W._Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal <head>treasury</head> or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' . Perhaps the public 's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no_more exists in America . In his stead is a milquetoast version known_as `` the corporation '' .</context>

      <context> With the help of Ziggy_Elman , also in the band , he transformed a traditional Jewish melody into a popular song , `` And_the_Angels_Sing '' . The countrywide success of `` Lazybones '' and `` And_the_Angels_Sing '' could only lead to Hollywood , where , besides Harold_Arlen , Mercer collaborated with Harry_Warren , Jimmy_Van_Heusen , Richard_Whiting , Walter_Donaldson , Jerome_Kern , and Arthur_Schwartz . Mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs . He may be the only song_writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the U._S._Treasury ; he collaborated on a song with William_Hartman_Woodin , who was Secretary of the <head>Treasury</head> , 1932 - 33 . When Johnny_Mercer and Harold_Arlen began their collaboration in 1940 , Mercer , like Arlen , had several substantial film songs to his credit , among them `` Hooray_for_Hollywood '' , `` Ride , Tenderfoot , Ride '' , `` Have_You_Got_Any_Castles , Baby ? '' , and `` Too_Marvelous_for_Words '' ( all with Richard_Whiting ) ; with Harry_Warren he did `` The_Girl_Friend_of_the_Whirling_Dervish '' , `` Jeepers Creepers '' , and `` You_Must_Have_Been_a_Beautiful_Baby '' . Mercer 's lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances , a puckish sense_of_humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair .</context>
