      <context> This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations . To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores . Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing - and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them . One wife , described by a New_York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual_relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday night neighborhood <head>card</head> parties . Another put sex on a dollars and cents basis . After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband 's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor . Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .</context>

      <context> But dominant in the sense that every other objective , no_matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it . Peace is a worthy objective ; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin , then we must fight . Freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ; but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit , then Algerian freedom must be postponed . Justice is a worthy objective ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union_of_South_Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification <head>cards</head> yet a while longer . Prosperity is a worthy objective ; but if providing higher standards_of_living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made . It may be , of_course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in_favor_of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of Soviet Communist power . This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used .</context>

      <context> Thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes , and the random_variable is not the number of successes . The constancy of p and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in_practice . Obviously , very slight changes in p do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference . ( For_instance , see Example 2 of Section 5 - 5 , on red <head>cards</head> in hands of 5 . ) On_the_other_hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical_phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a baseline for comparative purposes ; that_is , we may discuss the phenomenon in_terms_of its departures from the binomial model . A binomial experiment consists_of * * f independent binomial trials , all with the same probability * * f of yielding a success . The outcome of the experiment is X successes .</context>

      <context> She loved him and missed his company . Uncle_Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own . What it was Kate could not fathom . He claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play <head>cards</head> and drink with his cronies , but Kate had not smelled brandy on him since Mrs._Lattimer 's funeral . Joel knew what he was_about , however . `` You 're gonna get caught '' , she heard Joel say to Uncle_Randolph by the pump one morning . `` Not this old fox '' , chuckled Uncle_Randolph .</context>

He instructed Shirl_Winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call_board .</context>

      <context> The safe at Ingleside_District_Station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads to Captain_Harris 's office ( to the left ) , the lieutenant 's office ( farther along and to the left ) and the janitor 's supply_closet ( straight ahead ) . The safe is a repository for three dead flashlight_batteries , a_hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint <head>cards</head> , a stack of unsold Policemen's_Ball tickets from last year , and thirty-seven cents in coins and stamps . Gun set the captain 's fifth of Hiram_Walker inside the safe before he reported to Lt._Killpath , though he knew that Killpath 's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on Herman_Wolff 's gift . It was more a matter of tact , and also it was none of Killpath 's goddam business . He walked up_to the lieutenant 's office , leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed four rifles and a gas_gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine_gun that was occasionally tried_out on the Academy_Range .</context>

      <context> `` Huh-uh . Now , Mis-ter_McBride '' , said Lord , and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss 's arm . It was strictly the deputy 's game , but McBride had gone too far to throw_in . Now , he could only play the last <head>card</head> in what was probably the world 's coldest deck . He flung off Lord 's hand and attempted to push past him , inadvertently shoving him into a storefront . It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition . Lord slugged him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine .</context>

      <context> It slashed the sloping manure scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches . It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen_doors . Even the stable garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it . And the coffee_shop on Drexel_Street , where the men spent their evenings and Sundays playing <head>cards</head> , had a rose hedge beneath its window . The hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it . Only one house on the street had no lawn before it . It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade .</context>
