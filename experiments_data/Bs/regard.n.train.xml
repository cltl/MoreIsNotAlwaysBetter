      <context> In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high_school where he is found . In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation . High motivation towards higher_education must start early enough so_that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at_least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work . Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this <head>regard</head> in the Negro schools . However , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual . And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership . This is not due_to any policy of discrimination on_the_part_of the Northern universities .</context>

      <context> The congregation is first_and_foremost an economic peer_group ; it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship . If it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the New Protestantism ( with a_few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do . They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers . The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit '' of Protestant religious life ; in_fact , a contrast is often drawn in this <head>regard</head> with the `` impersonal '' Roman_Catholic parish . We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection . The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members .</context>

      <context> There is no_more `` plot '' than that ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give . The artistic interest , then , lies_in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness . The first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent : `` The way to the churchyard ran_along beside the highroad , ran beside it all_the_way to the end ; that_is_to_say , to the churchyard '' . And the action is consistently presented with <head>regard</head> for this distinction . The highroad , one might say at_first , belongs_to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs_to death . But that is too simple , and won't hold_up . As the first sentence suggests , both roads belong_to death in_the_end .</context>

      <context> The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner 's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil_War . It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other <head>regard</head> , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen_Glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society . Faulkner 's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life . They have an ancestry extending back , however , at_least to 1728 , when William_Byrd described the Lubberlanders he encountered in the back_country of Virginia and North_Carolina . The chief literary antecedents of the Snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated_in the South and the Southwest in the three decades before the Civil_War .</context>

      <context> The necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense_of_touch , as_such . We do not arrive_at spatial images by means of the sense_of_touch by itself . ( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual_sensation only by way of visual representations ; that_is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual_space '' . The underlying assumption , of_course , is that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully dependable way , to locate objects in space beyond us , the other senses being decidedly inferior , if_not totally inadequate , in this <head>regard</head> . This is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel . Therefore , if the sense_of_touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary . The force of the authors ' analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , I believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered .</context>

      <context> `` I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here . I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters . You may stay as long as you wish , of_course , but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into_account , I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in '' . To Mark : `` Please give my <head>regards</head> to Myra '' . She signed the letters quickly , stamped them , and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town . Then she went_back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water . `` My nephews will be coming_down '' , she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining_room , the whole meal on a vast linen covered tray .</context>

      <context> Time elapsed but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature . Startled , he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view , and Alex went_to the door . He opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling , coughing , and scraping noise as possible in_order to drown emanations from the hen who had begun to protest . It was Giselle , the fille_de_chambre , come to clean the room , and while she stood before him with ears pricked_up and <head>regard</head> all curiosity , explaining her errand , Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird . Giselle was reluctant but Alex succeeded in persuading her to come_back in five minutes and the door was shut again . `` Who was that , young feller '' ? the doctor instantly asked . `` That was the fille_de_chambre , the one you thought could n't get the eggs out .</context>
