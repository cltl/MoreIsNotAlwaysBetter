      <context> Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according_to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system - a system which the <head>party</head> opposes in its platform . Sam_Caldwell , State_Highway_Department public_relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd 's campaign . Caldwell 's resignation had been expected for some time . He will be succeeded by Rob_Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years .</context>

      <context> Jen_Nelson , as Thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive . And little Zeme_North , a Dora with real spirit and verve , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for Floyd , the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings . Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` On_the_Side_of_the_Angels '' and `` Politics_and_Poker '' were handled splendidly , and I thought Rudy_Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` Little_Tin_Box '' even better than it was done by the New_York cast ; all the words of its clever lyrics came_through with perfect clarity . The <head>party</head> at Floyd 's penthouse gave the `` chorines '' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era 's nonsense . LaGuardia 's multi lingual rallies , when he is running for Congress , are well staged , and wind_up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical_theater . Martin_Tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions . Not a corner has been visibly cut in this one .</context>

      <context> This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations . To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores . Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing - and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them . One wife , described by a New_York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual_relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday night neighborhood card <head>parties</head> . Another put sex on a dollars and cents basis . After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband 's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor . Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .</context>

      <context> In regard_to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of_this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light_mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the <head>party</head> and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on_trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as_well_as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? The infamous Wansee_Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put_to_death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich_Minister_of_the_Interior , the State_Secretary in_charge of the Four_Year_Plan , the Reich_Minister_of_Justice , the Under_Secretary_of_Foreign_Affairs .</context>

      <context> The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time . It included the top O_'_Banion men and Chief_of_Detectives_Michael_Hughes .

      <context> Location theorists have given these matters much consideration . The networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not_only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war . They also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitored . Without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy <head>party</head> . The need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling . Alexander_the_Great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at_once . As time has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military_vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range and breadth of message sending has increased .</context>

      <context> However , for convenience we will stick_to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 . On this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes . Presumably a cocktail_party is expected to fulfill the host 's desire to get_together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors . The <head>party</head> is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another . The information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air_waves , and is received by the ears . Since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net . As shown in Figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points .</context>

      <context> The annual dividends paid to du_Pont stockholders in shares of General_Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of du_Pont 's earnings and profits .

      <context> Nevertheless , impulses still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practices . Another great danger is that the emerging middle_class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political_leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism . The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West . Particularly when based upon a single dominant <head>party</head> , governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest . Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead rigid and inflexible in their policies . American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes . It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies .</context>

      <context> Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances . A third aspect , and probably the one open_to most controversy , is the results of the election . The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested parties , including the government itself , were busily engaged in determining the <head>party</head> identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections . The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics . Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence . They were stressed in the speeches of Si_Mubarak_Bekkai when the first Council_of_Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council .</context>

Until the Charter_of_Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes .

The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be supported by the King himself .

      <context> From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results . In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance . In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence , but in a system where there is as_yet no place for the less prominent . Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide , minority <head>parties</head> , such_as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958 , clamor for elections when out of power , but are not at_all certain they wish_to be controlled by popular choice when in power . Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process . The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco . At the central level the scrutin_uninominal_voting_system was selected over some form of the scrutin_de_liste_system , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political_parties .</context>

      <context> The extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase . We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put_up by the industry . The industry may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in_order to `` educate '' the government and the customers of the industry . As a strike continues , these <head>parties</head> increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement . They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail . Public indignation and resistance to wage price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3 % per_annum than when the increases are on the order of 3 % per month . The simple passage of an additional eleven months ' time makes the second 3 % boost more acceptable .</context>

The hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range , waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way_of_life .</context>

      <context> In the Middle_Ages , in the Renaissance , right up_to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world .

      <context> I kept saying , `` If I could just build_up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get_to be well_known as an illustrator - like Peter_Askington , for_instance - then I could take some time_off and paint '' . Askington was a kind of goal I set myself ; I had admired him long before I talked to him . It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income . The night we first met , at one of Mrs._Monmouth 's giant <head>parties</head> , he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt ; instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade . This set his tone : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as_well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off 's rent for a year . He was fifteen years older than I - forty four - but full of spring and sparkle . He did n't look_like what I thought_of as an old_man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger .</context>

      <context> `` Ciao , '' and put_out her hand . Her little brown face wrinkled up , her brown eyes gleamed , and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things . Agnese , smiling too , said , `` ' Ello '' , and_then more slowly , `` I am happy '' . And they sat_down and began their little coffee <head>party</head> . The Ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee . Acting only as interpreter Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal . She would turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again .</context>
