      <context> All_of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you . But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common_man , to point_up what happened to him under Eisenhower 's leadership . A perceptive journalist , Sam_Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as The Revolt Of The Moderates . He opens his discourse , however , with a <head>review</head> of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age . The show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny . Lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue . And I select this sentence as its pertinent summation : `` In_essence the drama of his ( Eisenhower 's ) Presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling - thus_far with but limited and precarious success - to give effective voice and force to_that conservatism '' .</context>

      <context> Asked which institution most needs correction , I would say the corporation as it exists in America today . At_first_glance this appears strange : of all people , was not America founded by rugged_individualists who established a new way_of_life still inspiring `` undeveloped '' societies abroad ? But hear Harrison_E._Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The_New_York_Times , and author of `` To_Moscow_-_And_Beyond '' . In a book <head>review</head> of `` The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State_Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West_Contacts_Staff in_order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy_and_Bess ' overrode the State_Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz_musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo_montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry_Ford , Hugh_Cooper , Thomas_Campbell , the International_Harvester_Co. , and David_W._Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' .</context>

      <context> He again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in_addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties , and that he opposed war in any form . Thereafter he was classified 1_,_-_O . On April 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board . In a periodic <head>review</head> , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1_,_-_A and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home . Upon administrative approval of the reclassification , he was ordered to report for induction on June 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so . He was not prosecuted , however , and his case was subsequently reopened , in the light of Sicurella_v._United_States , 348_U._S._385_(_1955_) . He was again reclassified 1_,_-_A by the local board .</context>

      <context> Even now no such claim is asserted . He bases his present contention on the general right to explore , indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume . But this is fully answered by United_States_v._Nugent , supra . There we held `` that the statutory scheme for <head>review</head> , within the selective_service_system , entitles [ conscientious_objectors ] to no guarantee that the FBI reports must be produced for their inspection '' . 346_U._S._,_at_5_-_6 . Even if we were not bound by Nugent , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report . The recommendation of the Department - as_well as the decision of the appeal board - was based entirely on the local board file , not on an FBI report .</context>

      <context> The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history . Some weapons_systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development . Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon_system , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems . This has necessitated a continuous <head>review</head> and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons_systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_systems which have been overtaken by events . Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated . For_example , the importance of the Regulus_2 , , a very promising aerodynamic ship to surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic_missile launched by submerged submarines . Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long range interceptor with a speed three_times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid 1960 's .</context>
