      <context> Du_Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General_Motors stock except through General_Motors ' distributions of stock or subscription_rights to its stockholders . On June 6 , 1958 , General_Motors submitted its objections to the Government 's proposal . It argued , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both General_Motors and du_Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; that the tremendous volume of General_Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General_Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity . General_Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as_required by the <head>mandate</head> of_this Court . The decrees proposed by the amici_curiae were filed in August of 1958 . These plans , like du_Pont 's contained provisions for passing the vote on du_Pont 's General_Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their spouses , and other people living in their households , as_well_as other specified persons , were to be totally disenfranchised . Both plans also prohibited common directors , officers , or employees between du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , on_the_one_hand , and General_Motors on_the_other .</context>
