      <context> A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained . The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental_to playing .

Command has achieved the ideal <head>amount</head> of reverberation . The music is always allowed the living_space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi performer .

      <context> Check the quantity and quality of all_of the recreation interests already existing at the site . Naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand_dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes . Quality is vitally important . Frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same <head>amount</head> of frontage on polluted water . Some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests . One of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery . It may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock formations , or unusual trees .</context>

      <context> This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water_sports . A body_of_water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use . It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wildlife . The <head>amount</head> of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important . A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use . The quantity of water flow may be critical ; a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer . If the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied .</context>

      <context> Very little in today 's living provides the strength we need , and nothing provides the flexibility . Dancers do have flexibility . They often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength . Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the <head>amount</head> of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing . Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas . This is n't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11 - year old boys in America cannot chin themselves once , and that English school_girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) . The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw .</context>

      <context> This can be done by stories in your house_organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers ' homes as_well_as by_word_of_mouth through your chain of command .

      <context> When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep_up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm . If you have a year-round , full-time job you can n't expect to grow much more than your family uses - unless other members of the family do a good_deal of the work or you hire help . As a rule , part-time farmers hire little help . In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the <head>amount</head> of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 . List the number of hours the family can be expected to work each_month . You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one . Do not include all your spare_time or all your family 's spare_time - only what you are willing to use for farm work .</context>

      <context> Three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs . You could not , of_course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small . If you want_to raise feed or carry_out some enterprise on a larger scale , you 'll need more land .

      <context> Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ? When he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged . In_the_first_place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale . Robert_Frost , for_instance , writes about rural life in New_England , but he does not include any significant <head>amount</head> of folklore in his poems . This has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk_poet '' , simply because he is a rural one . In the second place , a large_number of writers , making a more direct claim than Frost to being `` folk_writers '' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material . Stephen_Vincent_Benet 's John_Brown's_Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John_Steinbeck 's The_Grapes_of_Wrath and Carl_Sandburg 's The_People,_Yes .</context>

      <context> This is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility . The commands are specified by the military regulations ; are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound ; and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade_ground . This monitoring is necessary because , on a parade_ground , everyone can hear too_much , and without monitoring a confused social_event would develop . With troops dispersed on fields_of_battle rather than on the parade_ground , it may seem that a certain <head>amount</head> of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication . Years ago this was true , but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too_much is heard . In contrast to cocktail_parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal . In the extreme and oversimplified example suggested in Figure 3 , the organization is more easily understood and more predictable in behavior .</context>

      <context> Perhaps the public 's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no_more exists in America . In his stead is a milquetoast version known_as `` the corporation '' .

No <head>amount</head> of ballyhoo will cover_up the sordid facts . If we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it . First , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per_se cannot take economic leadership . Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind .</context>

Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , ' 13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , ' 58 ) .
