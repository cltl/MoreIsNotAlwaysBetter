      <context> `` Hip-pocket '' tactics are going_to be harder to apply . Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis . They have to be . With greater <head>investments</head> in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can n't switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible - or at_least not as economically . Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? We find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning . Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ?</context>

      <context> If you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $ 300 to $ 500 with attachments , 1960 prices ) . These tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing . Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer . If you are going_to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery <head>investments</head> when you choose among farm enterprises . You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs . If an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed - such_as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder - it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work . Before you look_for a farm you 'll need_to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want_to undertake ; and ( 2 ) whether you want_to buy or rent .</context>

      <context> Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family . It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it . Otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor .

      <context> So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard_to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation 's needs for survival . The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society . Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society . Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the <head>investment</head> and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by_any_means other_than the corporate form , e._g. constructing major airports or dams . Thus , if corporations are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject_to public control and needs . In all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services . Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human_beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests .</context>

      <context> The Farm_Credit_Administration , an independent agency located within the Department_of_Agriculture , supervises and coordinates a cooperative credit_system for agriculture . The system is composed of three credit services , Federal_Land_Banks and National_Farm_Loan_Associations , Federal_Intermediate ( short-term ) Credit_Banks , and Banks_for_Cooperatives . This system provides long - and short-term credit to farmers and their cooperative marketing , purchasing , and business service organizations . As a source of <head>investment</head> capital , the system is beneficial to local communities and encourages the development of industries in rural_areas . The credit provdied by the first two services in the system outlined above is primarily for general agricultural purposes . The third credit service , Banks_for_Cooperatives , exists under authority of the Farm_Credit_Act_of_1933 . The Banks_for_Cooperatives were established to provide a permanent source of credit on a sound basis for farmers ' cooperatives .</context>

      <context> The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for <head>investment</head> and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' . 353_U._S._,_at_589 .</context>

      <context> Several related tasks must be carried_out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved . These countries must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy . They must in their planning be able to count_on at_least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years . Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic <head>investment</head> programming to go_forward . Capital flows must be coordinated with national needs and planning . Finally , a balance must be effected among project finance , utilization of agricultural surpluses , and general balance_of_payments support . Thus , although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative , and many_of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant , the basic purpose of American economic_policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign_exchange .</context>

      <context> In the fall of 1878 , the `` Popular_Telegraph_Line '' was established between Manchester and Factory_Point by the owners , Paul_W._Orvis , Henry_Gray , J._N._Hard , and Clark_J._Wait . The line soon lived_up_to its name , as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital_stock . In 1879 the same Clark_Wait , with H._H._Holley of South_Dorset , formed the `` American_Telegraph_Line '' , extending from Manchester_Depot via Factory_Point and South_Dorset to Dorset . Besides being most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good <head>investment</head> for the owners '' . Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron_C._Burr and Mark_Manley of `` Burr_and_Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry_goods . Early equipment was very flimsy ; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles , making communications impossible . But companies continued to spring_up .</context>

It has given considerable trouble at_times and empties right into the Battenkill . Fire_District_No._1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise <head>investment</head> .
