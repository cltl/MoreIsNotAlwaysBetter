      <context> State_governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational_schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities . Only the Federal_government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs . If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states . However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic <head>unemployment</head> . Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . This probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment_compensation or a Youth_Conservation_Corps .</context>

      <context> As we have noted , however , we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate . The level of average_cost ( equal to marginal_cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate . The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership , and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate . The union does not regard <head>unemployment</head> of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy - its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment . The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases , but we abstract from these forces here . For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs . Productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time_period is not even well_known to the industry , much_less to the union or to the public .</context>

Signora_Ferraro , bobbing her head encouragingly , asked Sam about Canada , having a special interest . Carla translated . The old_woman had a nephew from North_Italy , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired_of the seasonal <head>unemployment</head> , and who had migrated to Canada to work_on the railway . For a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar . Did many_of Sam 's countrymen live in boxcars in the bush ? Had Sam ever lived in a boxcar ?</context>
