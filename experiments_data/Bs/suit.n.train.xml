      <context> As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated country . Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England . In representing part of this new picture , I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments ; but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican_Churches and about the present religious state of England . Since the Protestant clergy for_the_most_part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black <head>suit</head> , my Roman_collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman_Catholic cleric . In_any_case , I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen , even in Devonshire and Cornwall , where anti Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest . Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism . On my first Guy_Fawkes_Day here , I found Catholics as well as non Catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires , and was told that most Englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day .</context>

      <context> The mouth frequently breaks_into a disarming smile . The voice is light in timbre , with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage . The Irish accent is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections from the French . His tweed <head>suit</head> was a baggy gray and green . He wore a brown knit sports_shirt with no tie . We walked down the Rue_de_L_'_Arcade , thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church . The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world_shattering .</context>

      <context> However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of <head>suit</head> likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' . 353_U._S._,_at_589 . Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision .</context>

      <context> Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du_Pont and General_Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute . We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of <head>suit</head> , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints . The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition '' . 353_U._S._,_at_607 . On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion , the Court remanded the case to the District_Court to determine the appropriate relief .</context>

      <context> He was discharged from the hospital after a two day checkup and he and his parents had what Mr._McKinley described as a `` celebration lunch '' at the cafeteria on the campus . Rachel wore a smart hat and , because she had been warned recently about smoking , puffed at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick . Scotty 's father sat sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a cricket , looking about at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression of proprietorship . Teachers - men who wore brown <head>suits</head> and had gray hair and pleasant smiles - came to their table to talk_shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel . Rachel was polite , Scotty indifferent . They ate the cafeteria food with its orange sauces and Scotty gazed without interest at his food , the teachers , the heroic baronial windows , and the bright ranks of college banners . His father tried to make the food a topic .</context>

At two thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep_an_eye_on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi 's party . Then Rector , attired in his best blue serge <head>suit</head> , sat in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoking a cigarette and waiting . The air was cooler here , and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass , an effect which he found pleasant .</context>

      <context> We would attend a film and , later_on , I stated , we might go to the Mayflower_Coffee_Shop or Child 's or Toffenetti 's for waffles . I set the hour of our meeting for seven . At five o'clock that night it was already dark , and behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a groom . I wore a new double-breasted brown worsted <head>suit</head> with a faint herringbone design and wide lapels like a devil 's ears . My camp made leather wallet , bulky with twisted , raised stitches around the edges , I stuffed with money I had been saving . Hatless , in an overcoat of rough blue wool , I was given a proud farewell by my mother and father , and I set_out into the strangely still streets of Brooklyn . I felt superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving_behind , felt older than my years , and was full of compliments for myself as I headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of_that dull borough and into the unstable , tantalizing excitement of Manhattan .</context>

      <context> My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when '' ; and_others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commencing again her piano_lessons , her private_school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe . In my letters I took_on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real_life . Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after_school class I was enrolled . The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young_man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot_Sands - he of the porch steps anecdotes - who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar <head>suits</head> , and sneaked_off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them . Like Eliot , in my fantasies , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night 's climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love . The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle - it must have been late in September - I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and bloody , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life . For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in_that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie_awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep .</context>
