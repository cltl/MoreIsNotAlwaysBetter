      <context> But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . A_couple_of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par 5 hole . It made him human . And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a <head>sport</head> whose frustrations were driving them to despair . If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all .</context>

      <context> At a ceremony in the reception_room of Mayor_Richardson_Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William_A._Bill_Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night 's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New_York Chapter , Baseball_Writers_Association_of_America , at the Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel . Shea , the chairman of Mayor_Wagner_'s_Baseball_Committee , will be joined on the dais by Warren_Spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee_Braves ; Frank_Graham , the Journal-American <head>sports</head> columnist ; Bill_Mazeroski , the World_Series hero of the Pittsburgh_Pirates , and Casey_Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees . Stengel will receive the Ben_Epstein_Good_Guy_Award . Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe_Ruth_Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world_series . Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William_J._Slocum_Memorial_Award .</context>

      <context> Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William_J._Slocum_Memorial_Award . To Spahn will go the Sid_Mercer_Memorial_Award as the chapter 's player of the year . A crowd of 1400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song . The 53 - year old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a <head>sports</head> background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible_for the imminent return of a National_League club to New_York . Named by Mayor_Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James_A._Farley , Bernard_Gimbel and Clint_Blume , Shea worked relentlessly . His goal was to obtain a National_League team for this city . The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New_York with only the Yankees .</context>

      <context> The vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a_thousand unexpected guests for lunch . Larkin has an answer to all that . The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas , for_example , will provide needed space for the extra television_sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids . Also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor <head>sports</head> to keep them fit and contented . It 's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse . He does n't really need the immense sum_of_money ( probably converted from American gold on the London_Exchange ) he makes them pay . For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot .</context>

      <context> After_all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition . But if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics . Taking first things first , let 's understand the <head>sport</head> called gymnastics . It is made_up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run_through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work . The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms , but about 1930 it was in_favor_of games . The parallel_bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal_bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football .</context>

The gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection . In short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great_deal of character as_well . The addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen .</context>

      <context> Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life . ( An enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days . Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries . ) In most <head>sports</head> , as in most walks_of_life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the Russian competitor of 16 has at_least thirteen years of training behind him . The American is very lucky if he has three . If a nation wished to get a head_start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large_number of the problems that plague American schools . First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both .</context>

      <context> Our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance . The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics . But why gymnastics at_all ? And is the <head>sport</head> really important ? After_all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition . But if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics .</context>

      <context> If the dance teachers of America make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some_day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that_much ahead . School_teachers , all_too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators . There should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it . They should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the <head>sports</head> we will demand be taught . Dance teachers can respond to President_Kennedy 's request not_only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes_for strength and flexibility . Very little in today 's living provides the strength we need , and nothing provides the flexibility . Dancers do have flexibility .</context>

      <context> The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association . Since SAAMI 's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone_into the development of more places to_shoot for more youths and adults . We trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment . Are you getting top dollar from the shooting <head>sports</head> ? Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls , who will grow_up to enjoy a traditional American way_of_life - ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting_preserves ?</context>

      <context> The group known_as the American_Association_for_Health_,_Physical_Education_,_and_Recreation ( a division of the National_Education_Association ) initiated a conference which brought_together representatives of the National_Rifle_Association , SAAMI and the American_Fishing_Tackle_Manufacturers . This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known_as the Outdoor_Education_Project . The Outdoor_Education_Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life . The various team <head>sports</head> assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education .</context>

      <context> SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach . In 1959 SAAMI 's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting <head>sports</head> . This program is now nationally known_as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' . Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied_Merchandising_Corporation . The first program was sponsored by Abraham_+_Strauss , Hempstead , New_York , under the direction of Special Events director Jennings_Dennis .</context>

      <context> Modern_times have changed the world beyond recognition . The early years of the twentieth century seem very far_away . But with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain - a_few things remain constant , including the devotion of Americans to the great field_sports , hunting and fishing . As the generations move_on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor <head>sports</head> . Sporting firearms change , markedly for the better . Just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered_wagon , the demand of today 's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment . The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle_loader and slow firing single shot arms with modern fast firing autoloaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide_action firearms .</context>
