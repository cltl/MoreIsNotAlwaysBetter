      <context> `` Eve was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as_yet she was a virgin . And even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as_yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human_race ; so also did Mary , having a man betrothed [ to her ] , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human_race '' . Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no_doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' . His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the <head>end</head> prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary . That parallelism affects his picture of man 's disobedience too ; for as it was Christ , the Word_of_God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word_of_God in_the_beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe . With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality . At the nadir of that circuit is death .</context>
    </instance>
    <instance id="br-d04#w1572_0" docsrc="br-d04">
      <context> Nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God , and he still rules . Even death , therefore , has a providential as_well_as a punitive function . `` Wherefore also He [ God ] drove him [ man ] out of Paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because He envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because He pitied him , [ and did not desire ] that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable . But He set a bound to his [ state of ] sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an <head>end</head> to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take_place in the earth , so_that man , ceasing at_length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to God '' . This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus ' theology ; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ . As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life . It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is .</context>

As Origen interprets the <head>end</head> of history on the basis of its beginning , so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of Christ . `` Whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ?

In the late 1700 's Beccaria and van_Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it .

      <context> With over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . With the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens .

The Conference called_for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives . In 1930 , the Lambeth_Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate .</context>

      <context> Here is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement . The grounds for the Church 's position are Scriptural ( Old_Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural_law . The latter plays a prominent role in Roman_Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods . The Roman_Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective <head>end</head> . This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God 's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements .

      <context> One of these is the `` dissolve '' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene . As the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear . For a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger .

Immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time . Physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at_a_time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers '' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing .

This is the rate of projection ; it is also the rate of photographing . Time is built into the motion_picture , which cannot exist without time . Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an <head>end</head> - elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence . The `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to_be_sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo . In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film . Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time .</context>

      <context> The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil_War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way_of_life which had been destroyed . As they looked with_nostalgia to a society which had been swept_away , they were probably no_more than half conscious that they painted_in_colors which had never existed . Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp . The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas_Nelson_Page toward the <head>end</head> of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So_Red_the_Rose , by Stark_Young . Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark_Young 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook .</context>

      <context> To believe otherwise would be unrealistic . But in looking_at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the South , it is important not to lose the broader perspective . His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers . Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic_romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the <head>end</head> of the preceding century , and in_particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry_James and James_Joyce among them . His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him . My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked_at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by_no_means new with him , and most_of the problems he takes_up have had the attention of authors before him .</context>

If art is to release us from these postulated things [ things we must think symbolically about ] and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy , it must sever its connection with these common_sense entities '' .

      <context> Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army_Reserve . Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National_Guard contained in the 1960 Department_of_Defense Appropriation_Act should likewise be dropped . I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . I again proposed a reduction in the Army National_Guard and Army_Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the <head>end</head> of the fiscal_year 1961 . These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives . - About 30 % of the expenditures for the Department_of_Defense in 1961 are for military_personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel . These expenditures are estimated to be $ 12.1 billion , an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social_security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) .</context>

      <context> These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear . Just as the pressure exerted by surface_tension in a spherical drop is * * f and the pressure exerted by surface_tension on a cylindrical shape is * * f , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is * * f , where |g is the interfacial_tension and * * f and * * f are the two radii_of_curvature . This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason . If a is the major_axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes , the radius_of_curvature in the ab plane at the <head>end</head> of the axis is * * f , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axes is * * f . There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas . However , there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol_phthalate ( viscosity 155 poises ) suspended in corn_syrup of 71 poises in a paper by Mason and Bartok . This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of_course , not negligible .</context>

( 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80 .

Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome . I have found , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior . For_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got_up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the <head>end</head> of each session . Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met . This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard_to the wishes of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy_chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair - in_short , behaving as if I owned her room .</context>

It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more_than the foregoing facts [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , - that_is , from one <head>end</head> to the other - was unimpaired '' . If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense_of_touch can be explained by his defective visual condition .

      <context> The first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world ; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change . For this period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; the ceramic material of the age is more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative_of the hopes and fears of its makers , who begin to show scenes of human life and death . Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece ; objects in gold , ivory , and bronze grow more numerous . Since writing was practiced in the Aegean before the <head>end</head> of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful . Though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the Iliad to any specific era , this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by 750 . The Dipylon_Geometric pottery of Athens and the Iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of Greek civilization ; but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending . Greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution , in which the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth .</context>

      <context> The epic_poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the rise of firm political_units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men - all these had to await the progress of following decades . What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search . These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces . To interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an <head>end</head> within the period . The historian can only point_out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding . Throughout the Dark_ages , it is clear , the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently . The pace could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood_on_firm_ground .</context>

      <context> The first mention of an electric plant in Manchester seems to be one installed in Reuben_Colvin 's and Houghton 's gristmill on the West_Branch in Factory_Point . No records are available as_to the date or extent of installation , but it may have been in 1896 . On June_14 , 1900 the Manchester_Journal reported that an electrical_engineer was installing an electric_light plant for Edward_S._Isham at `` Ormsby_Hill '' . This was working by the <head>end</head> of August and giving satisfactory service . In November 1900 surveying was done under John_Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power_plant .

In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical .

      <context> When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesized '' - into larger planar shapes themselves simply in_order to maintain the integrity of the picture_plane .

Many years later , the photon counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration . Again , a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied . Then , after slowing the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a one gee deceleration .</context>

      <context> Ever since Bambi , and , more recently , Born_Free , there have been a_lot of books about animals , but few compare with Max_Fink 's wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable My_Friend_, the Quizzical_Salamander . Done in the modern style of a `` confession '' , Fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother 's pet salamander , Alicia . It is not an entirely happy book , as Mrs._Fink soon becomes jealous of Alicia and , in retaliation , refuses to continue to scrape the algae off her glass . Max , in a fit of despair , takes Alicia and runs_off for two marvelous weeks in Burbank ( Fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole life '' ) , at the <head>end</head> of which Alicia tragically contracts Parkinson's_disease and dies . This brief resume hardly does the book justice , but I heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major problems of our time . Opera in the Grand_Tradition , along with mah-jongg , seems to be staging a well deserved comeback . In this country , the two guiding_lights are , without_doubt , Felix_Fing and Anna_Pulova .</context>

      <context> For_example , when the film is only four minutes old , Neitzbohr refers to a small , Victorian piano_stool as `` Wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano_stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of_course , was Doris ( the English equivalent , when passed_through middle Gaelic derivations , of Wilhelmina ) . For the remainder of the movie , Chancellor_Neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano_stool with a slat from a Venetian_blind that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag . In this manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt_pangs caused by his personal assaults against the_English at Dunkirk . As we find_out at the <head>end</head> , it is not the stool ( symbolizing Doris , therefore the_English ) that he is punishing but the piece of Venetian_blind . And , when the slat finally shatters , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` He loves me , he loves me not '' . After a_few tortuous moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that Neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in_the_eyes_of a mute piece of sculpture . The effect , needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at_times a_bit obscure , the film is certainly a much needed catharsis for the `` repressed '' movie-goer .</context>
