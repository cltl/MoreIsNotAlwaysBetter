      <context> His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable . His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle . His counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick . Also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured_bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature <head>output</head> , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required . That Prokofieff 's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original '' than we prefer to believe . Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability . Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated .</context>

      <context> It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart 's left_ventricle , to indicate the blood_pressure in the heart itself . This pressure measurement may be made at_the_same_time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made . A simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in Fig. 2 . <head>Outputs</head> of the two systems are measured by a pulse_timing_circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple analogue_computer which feeds a multichannel_recorder . From this doctors can read heart_rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power . Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio_transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers . This original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm. in diameter .</context>

      <context> How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives of your benefit and service program ? Have you permitted it to become a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee morale and , consequently , increased productivity ?

Do you measure its relation_to reduced absenteeism , turnover , accidents , and grievances , and to improved quality and <head>output</head> ? Have you set specific objectives for your employee publication ? Is it reaching these goals ? Is it larger or fancier than you really need ?</context>

      <context> Within a_few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called Meurons . The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great_Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War_of_1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go_to Red_River where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest_Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire . The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the <head>output</head> of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward . When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river . Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort_Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland .</context>

      <context> And , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature '' . Henrietta was discovering in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition . Dr._Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of Sara_Sullam that he considered submitting it to the Century_Magazine or Harper 's but he decided that its Jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in The_Messenger , `` so our readers will be benefited instead '' . Under her father 's influence it did not occur to Henrietta that she might write_on subjects outside the Jewish field , but she did begin writing for other Anglo_Jewish papers and thus increased her <head>output</head> and her audience . And she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of Judas_Maccabeus performed at the Hanukkah festival which came in December . By her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that Papa and Mamma gave her a Life_of_Dickens as a spur to her aspiration . Another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of Johns_Hopkins_University within walking distance of home .</context>

      <context> The gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions ; however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux . An attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss . The following possibilities exist for achieving this : 1 . The use of high voltages and low currents by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power <head>output</head> . 2 . Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic_forces . 3 .</context>

      <context> The mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked_out , but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin ( Astwood , 1954 ) . On_the_other_hand , there are a_few antithyroid drugs of this same general type , such as resorcinol , possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine . Any of the antithyroid drugs , of either type , if given in large enough doses for a long period_of_time will cause goitre , owing to inhibition of thyroid_hormone synthesis , with production of hypothyroidism . The anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased <head>output</head> of TSH , causing the thyroid to enlarge . The effect of drugs that act_on the iodide concentrating mechanism can be counteracted by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet . The antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type , however , are not antagonised by such means . Besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol types , certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods .</context>

      <context> A random storage scheme , based on the spelling of forms , provides an economical way to compile this text form list . Dictionary forms found to match forms in the text list are marked . A location in the computer store is also named for each marked form ; dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text . Finally , information is retrieved from the dictionary as_required by stages of the translation process - the grammatic description for sentence-structure determination , equivalent choice information for semantic analysis , and target-language equivalents for <head>output</head> construction . The dictionary is a form dictionary , at_least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary_entries . Also , the dictionary is divided into at_least two parts : the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms .</context>
