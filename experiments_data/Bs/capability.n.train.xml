      <context> Marketing in the new decade will be no picnic - for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20 - 25 yr. . Why ? Companies of all types have made great advances in production <head>capabilities</head> and efficiencies - in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged R_+_D facilities , faster new product development . Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge . Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yr. ? Based on our experience with clients , we see 14 major problems which fall_into three broad groups - the market_place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management .</context>

      <context> They began to describe in_detail the woman 's capacity for response . In_fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , Dr._Albert_Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men . According to Dr._Ellis , the average 20 - year old American woman is capable of far greater sexual_arousal than her partner . Not surprisingly , Dr._Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out_to claim these <head>capabilities</head> . Yet , paradoxically , according to Dr._Maurice_Linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing_up to them . An aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle_under . `` When the husband becomes passive in_the_face_of his wife 's aggressiveness '' , Dr._Linden says , `` the wife , in_turn , finds him inadequate .</context>

      <context> Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78_th_Congress in 1943 passed P._L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure . Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their <head>capabilities</head> '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services .</context>
