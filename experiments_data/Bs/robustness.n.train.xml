      <context> The chief literary antecedents of the Snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated_in the South and the Southwest in the three decades before the Civil_War . These narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters ' libraries beside the morocco bound volumes of Horace , Mr._Addison , Mr._Pope , and Sir_Walter_Scott . There is evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William_Gilmore_Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural <head>robustness</head> such_as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him . Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus_Baldwin_Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy_Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him . Others who wrote_of low characters and low life included Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , creator of the Big_Bear of Arkansas and Tom_Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson_Jones_Hooper , whose character Simon_Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem_Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried_out his will ; and George_Washington_Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut_Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature .</context>
