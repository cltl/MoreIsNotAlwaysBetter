We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at_least , Bultmann .

      <context> But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths . For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in_contrast_to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality . The central concern of Erich_Auerbach 's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved . Following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels , the Christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` <head>figures</head> '' of divine power and reality . Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent . Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama . The artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction .</context>

As a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client . For this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant <head>figure</head> , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine . On_the_other_hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; no client would ever think_of asking him to do such things . Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private_eye ends_up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder . Operating as a one_man police_force in fact if not in_name , he is at_once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves .</context>

      <context> Adam_Smith was wrong . Not_only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism .

Now , although the roots of the mystery_story in serious literature go_back as far as Balzac , Dickens , and Poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19_th century that the private_detective became an established <head>figure</head> in popular fiction . Sherlock_Holmes , the ancestor of all private_eyes , was born during the 1890 s .

If , in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet .

      <context> As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions - particularly the former - provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period . Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress . It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2 . As one approach to doing this , <head>Figures</head> 3 and 4 have been constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 . The differences between onset age and completion age with_respect_to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows . The data for boy 34 appear in Figure 3 , and for girl 2 in Figure 4 . The numbering system used in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth centers .</context>

      <context> If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense_of_touch can be explained by his defective visual condition . But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at_hand . In what ways , then , did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself ? He could not see objects as unified , self-contained , and organized <head>figures</head> , as a person does with normal vision . The meaning of_this , as we shall see , is that he had no fund of visual memory-images of objects as objects ; and , therefore , he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again . Instead , he constantly became lost in parts and components of them , confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects , and_so_on , unless he allowed time to `` trace '' the object in_question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours . According_to his own testimony , he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots '' of color of a more_or_less indefinite size ; at their edges they slipped pretty_much out_of_focus altogether .</context>

The patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at_all ; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him .

The boy 's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did . Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm_cloud . Its form was a heavy <head>figure</head> in a fluttering soutane . But the boy could see only the goat 's belly . The Old_Man near the corner let the shadow pass_over him , sensing something portentous in it . He knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he would n't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog 's back .</context>

      <context> He was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with Gansevoort and Heiser behind him . A glance revealed that the main topgallant_mast had been carried_away . The aimless milling_about of_what had been a well trained , well organized crew struck Alexander with horror . He bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled <head>figure</head> as though for further instruction . Adrien_Deslonde hastened to Alexander 's side . `` Small violently jerked the weather royal_brace with full intention to carry_away the mast . I saw him myself and it was done after consultation with Cromwell .</context>

      <context> Then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work . Alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed . Their strategy was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by Philip_Spencer 's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated . When the mast was raised , Alexander gave the order for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three <head>figures</head> in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers . Spencer 's potential followers were openly sullen and morose , missing muster without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons , communicating with the three by glance and signal . One of the missing handspikes came_out of its hiding_place after Midshipman_Tillotson had been insolently disobeyed by Seaman_Wilson . Tillotson had reported the man to Gansevoort and an hour later , with back turned , had been attacked by Wilson , brandishing the weapon .</context>

      <context> Fing , a lean , chiseled , impeccable gentleman of the old_school who was once mistaken on the street for Sir_Cedric_Hardwicke , is responsible_for the rediscovery of Verdi 's earliest , most raucous opera , Nabisco , a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent_of the Mudugno version of `` Volare '' . Miss_Pulova has a voice that Maria_Callas once described as `` like chipping teeth with a screw_driver '' , and her round , opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the emotions demanded by the role of Rosalie . The Champs_Elysees is literally littered this summer with the prostrate bodies of France 's beat-up beatnik jeunes_filles . Cause of all this commotion : squat , pug-nosed , balding , hopelessly ugly Jean-Pierre_Bravado , a Bogartian <head>figure</head> , who plays a sadistic , amoral , philosophic Tasti-Freeze salesman in old New-Waver Fredrico_de_Mille_Rossilini 's endlessly provocative film , A_Sour_Sponge . Bravado has been alternately described as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of France and myself '' ( De_Gaulle ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob '' ! ( Norman_Mailer ) , but no one can deny that the screen crackles with electricity whenever he is on it . Soaring to stardom along with him , Margo_Felicity_Brighetti , a luscious and curvaceously beguiling Italian starlet , turns_in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic .</context>

      <context> Hell 's own amount of chaulmoogra_oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the Blessed_One to forgive their desecration . Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I 'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for_the_moment , let 's resume our catalogue . Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead , as a dealer in Khartoum assured me , I am not competent to say . Likewise the ivory Chinese female <head>figure</head> known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance Honan ) ; a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack . The three Indian brass deities , though - Ganessa , Siva , and Krishna - are an altogether different cup_of_tea . They hail from Travancore , a state in the subcontinent where Kali , the goddess of death , is worshiped . Have you ever heard of thuggee ?</context>

      <context> S._J._Perelman . The doors of the D train slid shut , and as I dropped into a seat and , exhaling , looked up across the aisle , the whole aviary in my head burst into song . She was a living doll and no mistake - the blue-black bang , the wide cheekbones , olive flushed , that betrayed the Cherokee strain in her Midwestern lineage , and the mouth whose only fault , in the novelist 's carping phrase , was that the lower lip was a_trifle too voluptuous . From what I was able to gauge in a swift , greedy glance , the <head>figure</head> inside the coral colored boucle dress was stupefying .</context>
