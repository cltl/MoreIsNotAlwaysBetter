The complexities of <head>communication</head> have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English_language that has been excellently dubbed in_place_of the Russian dialogue . The voices of all the characters , including that of Cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities . And the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed . Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here .</context>

Are there regular <head>communications</head> from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R_+_D people ? Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it 's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash_register .

This monitoring is necessary because , on a parade_ground , everyone can hear too_much , and without monitoring a confused social_event would develop . With troops dispersed on fields_of_battle rather than on the parade_ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of <head>communication</head> .

A military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command . This objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action . The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting_as a single coordinated unit has a different <head>communication</head> network than a factory , a college , or a rural village . The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( a ) One man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too_much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc. . ( b ) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times . ( c ) Decisions of a general kind are made by the central command .</context>

Or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a simile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking .</context>

      <context> Or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a simile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking . Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is , more_often_than_not , entirely unaware . His subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one . One hebephrenic women confided to me , `` I live in a world of words '' , as if , to her , words were fully concrete objects ; Burnham , in his excellent article ( 1955 ) concerning schizophrenic <head>communication</head> , includes mention of similar clinical material . A borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding , in a most articulate fashion , during session after session with me , were like great cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him ; as he spoke I was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung , high in the air , from a docked steamship .</context>

      <context> Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . At another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother introject began to emerge more_and_more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' ! I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; but a_few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you '' ! Again , I at_first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense <head>communication</head> , and I quickly cast through my mind to account_for her being able to speak , with such utter conviction , of an opinion held by my father , now several years deceased . Then I replied , coldly , `` If you despise me , why do n't you say so , directly '' ? She looked confused at this , and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make . It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you '' ?</context>

      <context> Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process . The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco . At the central level the scrutin_uninominal_voting_system was selected over some form of the scrutin_de_liste_system , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political_parties . The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of <head>communication</head> and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections . Although the elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates . With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly . Both parties and the Ministry_of_the_Interior were busily at_work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance .</context>

      <context> In 1879 the same Clark_Wait , with H._H._Holley of South_Dorset , formed the `` American_Telegraph_Line '' , extending from Manchester_Depot via Factory_Point and South_Dorset to Dorset . Besides being most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good investment for the owners '' . Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron_C._Burr and Mark_Manley of `` Burr_and_Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry_goods . Early equipment was very flimsy ; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles , making <head>communications</head> impossible . But companies continued to spring_up . By 1883 the `` Battenkill_Telegraph_Company '' was in existence and Alvin_Pettibone was its president . Operating in 1887 was the `` Valley_Telegraph_Line '' , officers of which were E._C._Orvis , president ; H._K._Fowler , vice-president and secretary ; J._N._Hard , treasurer ; F._H._Walker , superintendent ; H._S._Walker , assistant superintendent .</context>

      <context> Next , the hen was nested and all seemed well . The two men sat for some time , savoring the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings , before they got_up and left the hotel , the doctor to go_to the conference_house and Alex to go_to the main post_office . Alex returned to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospects of a role , in the late afternoon , but found the doctor in an ebullient mood . At the time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate <head>communication</head> with the hen , who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrences of the morning . `` Chickens have short memories '' , the doctor remarked , `` that 's why they are better company than most people I know '' , and he went_on to break some important news to Alex . `` Well '' , he began , `` It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference_house do . They 've got a big vulture from Tanganika at the zoo here , with a wife for him , too , very rare birds , both of them , the only Vulturidae of their species outside Africa .</context>

      <context> It was a fine broody_hen , white , with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen . The doctor , with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope , drew Alex 's attention to those excellences which might otherwise have escaped him : the fine color in comb and wattles , the length and quality of neck and saddle_hackles , the firm , wide spread of the toes , and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets . All search was ended ; he had found his fowl . The purchase was effected and they made_their_way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of <head>communication</head> had been set_up , nestling in the doctor 's arms . The clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel entrance ; and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex 's well exercised breast . The doctor was wearing a long New_England greatcoat , hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens . Alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who , for all his care , manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradled .</context>
