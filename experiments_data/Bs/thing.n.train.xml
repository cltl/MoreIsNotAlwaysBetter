The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton_Davidson throwing only 17 passes .</context>

A_few years ago a `` Timex All Star Jazz Show '' offered a broad range of styles , ranging from Lionel_Hampton 's big_band to the free-wheeling Dukes_of_Dixieland . An enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live '' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance .

Instead , the audience can sit_back at_ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no_longer believes_in such <head>things</head> , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion . A teenage girl , Abigail_Williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the Reverend_Samuel_Parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings . For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air . As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .</context>

      <context> However , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at_least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace . To_be_sure , when this is pointed_out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from Paul 's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of First_Corinthians . But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indignation ? Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking_about the same <head>thing</head> ? Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world . by analogy , the church also has been regarded_as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in_order to be the church .</context>

But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather_than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location . Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the <head>thing</head> that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness . Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists_of minute waves of energy . We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound_waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite . So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states_of_matter , successive one_after_another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies .</context>

In any social_system in which communications have an importance comparable_with that of production and other human factors , a point like f in Figure 2 would ( other <head>things</head> being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizens . A point like p gets information directly from n , but all information beyond n is indirectly relayed through n . The dweller at p is last to hear about a new cure , the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses , the one who goes the farthest to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting_over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort . Since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such_as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar_maple camp .</context>

      <context> In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon_Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human_beings and events . But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap .

I use this term to mean three <head>things</head> : a search for the human significance of an event or state_of_affairs , a tendency to look_at wholes rather_than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling .

Probably the most important <head>thing</head> to focus_on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available . This is in large part a code_of_behavior and a glossary of values : what is it that people do and should do and_how one should regard it . In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint .

      <context> It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship .

By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other <head>things</head> in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage .

Durkheim noted long_ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred <head>things</head> - unite [ s ] into one single moral community - all those who adhere to them '' . His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit .

It is no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient , the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients , shows , as one of his characteristic symptoms , laughter - laughter which now makes one feel scorned or hated , which now makes one feel_like weeping , or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man 's despair ; and which , more often than all these , conveys a welter of feelings which could in_no_way be conveyed by any number of words , words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another .

Recently , for_example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was . Or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a simile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking . Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is , more_often_than_not , entirely unaware .</context>

      <context> Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs . The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic ' esthetics ' , which usually turns_out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried_over from European languages . Many_of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they purport to represent . Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting <head>things</head> of much greater significance . As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion . A._E._Sharp , in Vowel-Length_and_Syllabicity_in_Kikuyu , examines one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in_detail .

The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features . Of_course , something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology : consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and an individual component . But in_general the individual variation is a small <head>thing</head> added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude . With tone , individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them .

Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure . Whether or not it is in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends_upon the extent to which the public limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase . The extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three <head>things</head> : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase . We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put_up by the industry .

      <context> The pain in itself was neutral ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no grounds at_all , took_up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for_the_first_time , and in the only intelligible sense , bad . This way of escape is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so_far_as I know , been urged by positivists , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it . I come now to a third argument , which again is very simple . When we come_upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad <head>thing</head> , we presumably make it with some feeling ; the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling . But suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again . And suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in_the_first_place has faded .

We should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time , but that it was the same point we were making . And if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same , while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero , it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express .

      <context> Whatever the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today , Dostoevsky 's companions were about as grim a lot as can be imagined . `` I have heard stories '' , he writes , `` of the most terrible , the most unnatural actions , of the most monstrous murders , told with the most spontaneous , childishly merry laughter '' . Most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very unfitting . If we were asked why we thought so , we should say that these <head>things</head> involve great evil and are wrong , and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting . Now on the subjectivist view , this answer is ruled_out . For before someone takes_up an attitude toward death , suffering , or their infliction , they have no moral quality at_all . There is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting .</context>

As we think_of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered , we are very likely to say : `` It was a bad <head>thing</head> that the little animal should suffer so '' .

Let us suppose that the animal did not in_fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at_all , but that we mistakenly believe it did , and say as before that its suffering was an evil <head>thing</head> . On the positivist theory , everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second . In the only sense in which badness is involved at_all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety , since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling , and that feeling is still there .

The suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after_all making no mistake , because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering , seems to me merely frivolous . If we did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred ? On the theory before us , such relief would be groundless , for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at_all , and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved about .</context>

      <context> ( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade . Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line_of_work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation requiring a great_deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour . It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more_than the foregoing facts [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; or , to put the same <head>thing</head> in physiological terms , that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , - that_is , from one end to the other - was unimpaired '' . If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense_of_touch can be explained by his defective visual condition .

Quite naturally , they make the investigation , first , by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at_all and_then , later , by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to .</context>

      <context> ( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual_sensation only by way of visual representations ; that_is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual_space '' . The underlying assumption , of_course , is that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully dependable way , to locate objects in space beyond us , the other senses being decidedly inferior , if_not totally inadequate , in this regard . This is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel . Therefore , if the sense_of_touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of <head>things</head> and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary . The force of the authors ' analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , I believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered . ( 1 ) What allows us to think that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his eyes were closed ? ( 2 ) What evidence is there that he was psychically blind ?</context>

      <context> In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role . Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced . We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk_lore of the Greeks .

It is not merely a new thing ; it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; most_of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism . But to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin_Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine 's encounter with man .

      <context> Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper , and the only lesser immediacy of block_capitals that simulate window lettering , manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture_plane so that it does not `` jump '' . At_the_same_time , the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them , and by their placing in_relation_to the block_capitals ; and these capitals seem in_turn to be pushed_back by their placing , and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining . Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every_other part and plane ; and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface . And the same <head>thing</head> , more_or_less , can be said of the contents of Picasso 's first collage . In later collages of both masters , a variety of extraneous materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in_conjunction_with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think_of . The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material - or simply of a painted in form - will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth . Planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially .</context>

      <context> Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas . It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's , which would confirm the date he assigns it . But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as_well_as of typography ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 . When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same <head>thing</head> happens in each . ( It makes no real difference that Braque 's collage is on_paper and eked_out in charcoal , while Picasso 's is on canvas and eked_out in oil . ) By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done . But here again , the surface declaring device both overshoots and falls_short_of its aim .</context>

Stowey_Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality .

This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil_geologist .

Also , she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled_up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish . She would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting . It never worked , naturally ; but it made her look unusual .</context>

      <context> But this is a public park and it 's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on '' . Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir '' . The policeman walked on , but he looked_back once . That had happened on the day when two other unusual <head>things</head> had occurred . Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; and they had told their mother about the tumbles . In matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; and so they were consistently true to their principles . `` Never_mind_'' , Arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having pursued the usual unco-operative course of grownups .</context>

      <context> The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor . The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue_pie , gets a plate of English_muffins instead . Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after_all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest <head>thing</head> to happen to the American theatre since Brooks_Atkinson retired . Aging but still precocious , French feline enfant_terrible Francoisette_Lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old Paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called The_Lascivious_Interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in_love with a middle-aged steam_shovel . A biting , pithy parable of the all pervading hollowness of modern life , the piece has been set by Mlle_Lagoon to a sumptuous score ( a single motif played over_and_over by four thousand French_horns ) by existentialist hot-shot Jean-Paul_Sartre . Petite , lovely Yvette_Chadroe plays the nymphomaniac engagingly .</context>

      <context> Soaring to stardom along with him , Margo_Felicity_Brighetti , a luscious and curvaceously beguiling Italian starlet , turns_in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic . The battle of the drib-drool continues , but most of New_York 's knowing sophisticates of Abstract_Expressionism are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation of V ( for Vindication ) Day , September first , when Augustus_Quasimodo 's first one-man show opens at the Guggenheim . We have heard that after seeing Mr._Quasimodo 's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . And it is thought by many who think_about such <head>things</head> that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet , progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso , and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De_Kooning . Quasimodo defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' . `` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to Franz_Kline and myself , `` the nothing that_is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non time '' . It is his relentlessness and unwavering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` The_Invasion_of_Cuba '' .</context>
