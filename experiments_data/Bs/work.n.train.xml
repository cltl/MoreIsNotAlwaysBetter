In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods .

      <context> It is into this household , one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people , that George_Dillon enters at the beginning of the play . An unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists . By the end of the third act , the artist is dead but the body lingers on , a shell among other shells . Not altogether a successful play , `` Epitaph_for_George_Dillon '' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser <head>work</head> might be crippling . It is awfully talky , for_instance , and not all_of the talk is terribly impressive . But it strikes sparks on_occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten .

      <context> It is to this same tradition that most_of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong . For we must number here not_only the names of Bushnell , Clarke , and Rauschenbusch , not_to_mention those of `` the Chicago_School '' and Macintosh , but those of the brothers Niebuhr and ( if America may claim him ! ) Tillich as_well . Finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that developed at the University_of_Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative <head>work</head> of Alfred_North_Whitehead . What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged_to it have been profoundly in_earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern_world . Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity . They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked_upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .</context>

      <context> But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indignation ? Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking_about the same thing ? Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his <head>work</head> in the world . by analogy , the church also has been regarded_as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in_order to be the church . But , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a_fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God 's providence , presents it . And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men .</context>

      <context> It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is . This applies to his picture of Adam .

It becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose <head>work</head> culminates in the achievement of immortality . This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek speaking ones .

      <context> This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced . If death receives more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through Christ begins to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence . Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history . Because Christianity teaches not_only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of Christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the Christian understanding of the <head>work</head> of Christ .</context>

      <context> In_the_end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings . Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at_times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song . The engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result . Too many records seem to reduce a <head>work</head> of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment . The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration .

      <context> The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy . The twenty-five year old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet . There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is_due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs . Turning_to the more modern versions , Curzon 's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard <head>work</head> . Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought_out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout . Some of Curzon 's playing strikes me as finicky , however . Why , for_example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ?</context>

      <context> Roy_Mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of John_Sell_Cotman . And like this English master , Mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in_reality the result of skilled design born of hard <head>work</head> and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them . As a boy Roy_Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods . His father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting_expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature . Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on_the_wing - almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape .</context>

      <context> For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose . `` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him . Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition . If the artist would study his <head>work</head> more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result . Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call ' clicking ' . `` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do_well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition . `` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color .</context>

When the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ?</context>

In_spite_of the shading of one type of course into another , I believe it is useful to talk_about vocational courses as apart from academic courses . Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded_as the exception which proves the rule . Today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic <head>work</head> in college and a professional school . Most_of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high_schools .

In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high_school where he is found . In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation . High motivation towards higher_education must start early enough so_that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at_least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic <head>work</head> .

      <context> I should_like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect_to vocational education . First_and_foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic_program for graduation . Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more_than half the student 's time in those years ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought_to begin earlier . Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the <head>work</head> ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality . This last point is important because if high_school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational_program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears . Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in_fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter .</context>

      <context> There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the <head>work</head> of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . ) In a mobile society , congregational health depends_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like elements will have_to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .</context>

When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .

      <context> The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil_War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way_of_life which had been destroyed . As they looked with_nostalgia to a society which had been swept_away , they were probably no_more than half conscious that they painted_in_colors which had never existed . Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp . The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the <head>works</head> of Thomas_Nelson_Page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So_Red_the_Rose , by Stark_Young . Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark_Young 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook .</context>

Others who wrote_of low characters and low life included Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , creator of the Big_Bear of Arkansas and Tom_Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson_Jones_Hooper , whose character Simon_Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem_Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried_out his will ; and George_Washington_Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut_Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature .

      <context> His denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no_doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the South or have written_about the South . To believe otherwise would be unrealistic . But in looking_at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the South , it is important not to lose the broader perspective . His earliest <head>work</head> reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers . Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic_romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in_particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry_James and James_Joyce among them . His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him . My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked_at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern .</context>

      <context> Most skilled industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions . The National_Manpower_Council of Columbia_University has estimated that three out of five skilled_workers and one out of five technicians have not been formally trained . There is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education . Employers prefer to hire youth with such training rather_than those without , and most graduates of vocational training go to <head>work</head> in jobs related to their training . Vocational educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled_workers , but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills . In most states , trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high_schools , usually located in the larger cities . In Arkansas fewer than 6 per_cent of the high_schools offer trade and industrial courses .</context>

      <context> An extension of this program into the other distressed areas should be undertaken . Some of this trend toward area vocational_schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry .

A_few key skilled_workers experienced in the company 's type of <head>work</head> usually must be brought_in with the plant manager , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere . A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training_programs in the area to supply future skilled_workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees . The existence of a public_school vocational training_program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled .

      <context> ( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade . Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line_of_work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation requiring a great_deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour . It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his <head>work</head> , even more_than the foregoing facts [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , - that_is , from one end to the other - was unimpaired '' . If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense_of_touch can be explained by his defective visual condition . But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at_hand . In what ways , then , did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself ?</context>

      <context> In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos . They had had_to work_on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses . The potters , in_particular , had virtually eschewed freehand drawing , elaborate motifs , and the curving lines of nature , while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe . In their vases were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization , at_first hesitantly in Protogeometric <head>work</head> , and_then more confidently in the initial stages of the Geometric style . By 800 social and cultural security had been achieved , at_least on a simple plane ; it was time to take bigger steps , to venture on experiments . Ripe_Geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited . In these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress .</context>

Though the spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not_yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the Cyclades , which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century . As the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident .

Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century .

Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval , the Renaissance , and the modern . The medieval was the most important to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas_More , the author of Utopia , in some intelligible relation with St._Thomas_More , the martyr .</context>

He worked standing , with his left hand in his pocket as_though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person 's hand . Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved .

This air of disengagement carried_over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine .
