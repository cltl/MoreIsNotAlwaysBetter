      <context> Mongi_Slim of Tunisia and Frederick_Boland of Ireland were early favorites in_the_running , but France did n't like the former and the Soviet_Union would have none of the latter . With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr._Hammarskjold , U_Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto . What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy . In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers_game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of <head>principle</head> and a skilled diplomat . He has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future . He is a Buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not_only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung . U_Thant of_course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when Mr._Hammarskjold 's term would have come to an end .</context>

      <context> It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . To do this , it is sufficient to point_out that if the <head>principle</head> in_terms_of which alternatives are to be conceived is such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question . Thus , if what is at_issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either case the judgment in_question is false . Hence , if what is in_question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a_little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded . Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on_the_one_hand , by the two at_least apparently self-consistent but mutually_exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on_the_other_hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann .</context>

      <context> True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate . Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; a middle_distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general <head>principle</head> , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia . It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment .</context>

      <context> Inspiring - yes ; instructive - maybe ; duplicable - no ! But for the technical fact , we have the artist 's own testimony : `` Of_late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors . First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately * * f inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design <head>principles</head> of three simple values - the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark - by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns . If a human figure or wild_life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch . For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose . `` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .</context>

      <context> The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior_designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference_of_opinion . The architects do not believe that the education of the interior_designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer is incapable of understanding the architectural <head>principles</head> involved in planning the interior of a building . Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round_tables , workshops or panel_discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled_down crux_of_the_matter is education . It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more .

      <context> Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation . In a rapidly changing society congregations will run_into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more_than a single generation . The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of_this struggle to maintain economic balance . The expense of_this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the <head>principle</head> of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development . It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends - expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings . These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis . Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions .</context>

      <context> They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers . The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit '' of Protestant religious life ; in_fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal '' Roman_Catholic parish . We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection . The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the <head>principle</head> of economic integration . This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members . The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations . There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world .</context>

      <context> In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per_cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' . If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 per_cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact . On the surface , this seems a sound approach to Christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care_for new people ; the new people respond in_kind by joining the church . Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; association by level of achievement is the dominant <head>principle</head> of informal relations . This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking_up the wave_lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social_class nucleus of the congregation . Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so_long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless - friendly contacts no_longer keep it going . The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational_activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members .</context>

Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato . But Aristotle kept the <head>principle</head> of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths . For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in_contrast_to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality . The central concern of Erich_Auerbach 's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved . Following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels , the Christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures '' of divine power and reality .</context>

The greatest impact of the matching fund <head>principle</head> has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds . National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades . During World_War 2 , about 7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) Vocational Education for National Defense , and ( 2 ) War Production Training . The total cost of the five year program was $ 297 million .</context>

      <context> Not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis . Many potters clung_to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas ; the poet of the Iliad deliberately archaized . Although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era , I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of Greek civilization . On this <head>principle</head> of division I must postpone the evolution of sculpture , architecture , society , and politics ; for the developments in these areas make_sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself . The growing contacts between Aegean and Orient are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of Hellenic culture after 750 . We shall not be able entirely to pass_over these connections to the East as we consider Ripe_Geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious evolution of early Greece ; the important point , however , is that these magnificent achievements , unlike those of later decades , were only incidentally influenced by Oriental models . The antecedents of Dipylon vases and of the Iliad lie_in the Aegean past .</context>

The antecedents of Dipylon vases and of the Iliad lie_in the Aegean past . The pottery of the first_half of the eighth century is commonly called Ripe_Geometric . The severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years , the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a mastery of the <head>principles</head> underlying Geometric pottery ; but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance . The vases which resulted had different shapes , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style . Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines . In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos .</context>

      <context> Whenever artists , indeed , turned_to actual representations or molded three-dimensional_figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . At_the_least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; their <head>principles</head> of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go_too_far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . The storms of the past had died_away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not_yet begun to disturb men 's minds .</context>

During the Brown trial , however , the state 's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence_Daily_Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not_only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal_governments .

      <context> Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city . He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments . In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took_part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned '' . He recalled that in Rhode_Island a party opposed to the state 's condemnation of a man ( Thomas_W._Dorr ) proclaimed the state 's action as a violation of the law of the land and the <head>principles</head> of human liberty . At the close of Davis ' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously : Whereas , John_Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper : Therefore ,</context>
