      <context> Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced . And although Schnabel 's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert 's dynamic markings and phrase indications . The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a <head>search</head> for superlatives . About the Pro_Arte 's contribution I am less happy . I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group . From a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro_Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here .</context>

      <context> ( 1 ) As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do . ( 2 ) If earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields . In the <head>search</head> for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources . We have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate . The following discussion of_this subject has been adapted from the book Causes_of_Catastrophe by L._Don_Leet . At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday , April 18 , 1906 , San_Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake .</context>

      <context> There is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else . Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important . Moreover , if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo thinking ; if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity . The second timely part of_this sketch of literature and the <head>search</head> for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary_works and the ephemeral mass_culture products of today . In the range and variety of characters who , in their literary lives , get_along all_right with life_styles one never imagined possible , there is an implicit lesson in differentiation . The reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ? and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species . The observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be , like the models he sees , even more like everybody else .</context>

      <context> In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon_Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human_beings and events . But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap . I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth . I use this term to mean three things : a <head>search</head> for the human significance of an event or state_of_affairs , a tendency to look_at wholes rather_than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling . It is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia . I think these attributes cluster , but I have no evidence . In_fact , I can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art .</context>

      <context> The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres . Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH ; somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH , SiH , and ScH . Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ; in interstellar gas , concentrations as low as * * f molecules / * * f may be sufficient , as compared to the * * f hydrogen_atoms * * f required for detection of the 21 - cm line . High sensitivity in radio_telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver ; therefore , only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical <head>search</head> for the radio_spectra of these molecules feasible . To secure precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free_radical microwave spectroscopy has been started . Since conventional methods are insensitive at the low_frequencies of these molecular transitions , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead . This involves the application of a strong magnetic_field to the radical vapor , which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range , where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity .</context>

      <context> The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality . It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his <head>search</head> was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action . To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy . First , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity . National identification was not new , but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new unifications occurred .</context>

      <context> Further we cannot go , for the Dark_ages deserve their name . Many aspects of civilization were not_yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure . The epic_poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the rise of firm political_units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men - all these had to await the progress of following decades . What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the <head>search</head> . These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces . To interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period . The historian can only point_out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding .</context>

      <context> For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless <head>search</head> for a cup of hot coffee . They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor . The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue_pie , gets a plate of English_muffins instead . Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after_all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks_Atkinson retired .</context>

We have heard that after seeing Mr._Quasimodo 's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . And it is thought by many who think_about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet , progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso , and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De_Kooning . Quasimodo defines his own art as `` the <head>search</head> for what is not there '' . `` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to Franz_Kline and myself , `` the nothing that_is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non time '' . It is his relentlessness and unwavering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` The_Invasion_of_Cuba '' .
