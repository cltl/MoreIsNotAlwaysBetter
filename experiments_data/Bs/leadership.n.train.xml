      <context> Stengel probably preached too_much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble_gum and sow_his_oats . Inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph_Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey . The Major decided that , rather_than be led , the slugger could lead . And what <head>leadership</head> a proud Mantle has given so_far . The opinion continues here that with a 162 - game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10 - team league and a most inviting target in Los_Angeles ' Wrigley_Field_Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe_Ruth 's 60 homers of 1927 . Mays ' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year . Willie 's wonderful walloping Sunday - four home_runs - served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin_Dark .</context>

      <context> The Outdoor_Education_Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life . The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and <head>leadership</head> development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach .</context>

      <context> This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used . This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power . I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be . And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free_world <head>leadership</head> in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . In the recent political_campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus . One was demonstrably false ; the other , for_the_most_part , true . The first was that America had become - or was in_danger_of becoming - a second-rate military power .</context>

      <context> High motivation towards higher_education must start early enough so_that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at_least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work . Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools . However , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual . And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual <head>leadership</head> . This is not due_to any policy of discrimination on_the_part_of the Northern universities . Quite the contrary , as I can testify from personal experience as a former university president . Rather we see here another vicious_circle .</context>

      <context> Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such_as the coastal lowlands centering_on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West_Indies than with the North even after independence . The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area . In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old_South . Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no_longer any hope of sharing_in the <head>leadership</head> of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother_country . And no_doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors . All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did .</context>

      <context> During the next five years the leaders of the Fair_Deal reluctantly backed_down from the optimistic expectations of the New_Deal . During the next five years liberal leaders in the United_States sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment - and the bitterest irony - enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : the atom_bomb . In 1952 , it will be remembered , the G._O._P. without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal <head>leadership</head> and won overwhelmingly . All_of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you .

      <context> This is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after World_War_2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace . The long road that had taken liberals in_this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State . And the USSR existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . And by the time the war ended , liberal <head>leadership</head> in_this country was spiritually Marxist . We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San_Francisco to set_up the legal framework , finally and at_last , to rationalize war - to rationalize want and fear - out of the world : the United_Nations . We of the liberal led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation . Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally .</context>

      <context> Thus , if corporations are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject_to public control and needs . In all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services . Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human_beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests . Such genuine human <head>leadership</head> the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot . It can project long-range goals for itself . Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e._g. , quarterly and annual dividend reports . Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ; corporations , being more amorphous , cannot .</context>

      <context> But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ; and our loss of `` prestige '' abroad is the direct result . No amount of ballyhoo will cover_up the sordid facts . If we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it . First , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per_se cannot take economic <head>leadership</head> . Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind . When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism . The biggest loss , of_course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy .</context>
