      <context> Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green_Bay_Packers . The Eagles signed him for Shaw 's staff in 1959 . Skorich began his new job auspiciously today . At a ceremony in the reception_room of Mayor_Richardson_Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the <head>championship</head> . Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William_A._Bill_Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night 's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New_York Chapter , Baseball_Writers_Association_of_America , at the Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel .

      <context> The exercise I shall discuss in this - the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition specialization of a particular body_part - is the One_Leg_Lunge . Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no_matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ! It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline - that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders - a criterion of muscle `` drama '' that_is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike - the facet of muscular development that wins prizes . Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most <head>championship</head> Olympic lifters which is easily understandable . The One_Leg_Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts . But for purely definition purposes - used in conjunction with your regular Squatting , Leg_Curling , Leg_Extensor programs - a heavy weight is not needed . Indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be_performed .</context>
