      <context> Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in_relation_to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat . When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor - if I have been working on a full sheet in the field . `` When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal . When this linear <head>draft</head> is completed , I dust it down to a faint image . From this point , I paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage . However , first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described . Then I plan my attack : the parts I will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details - all_in_all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness .</context>

      <context> District_Attorney M._W._Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms - he just did n't catch anyone . Increasing threats on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New_Mexico . His friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense , perpetuating the troubles . By early summer , he wrote from Laramie that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in_a_bad_way financially , so Pels sent him a <head>draft</head> for $ 100 , warning that it was still not wise for him to return . Pels also sent a check for $ 100 to Russell 's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his grave . Cattle stealing and killing , again serious during the spring of 1891 , placed the land_grant company officers in a perplexing position . They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property , thus running_the_risk of creating disturbances such_as that on the Vermejo , and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle_thieves and running_the_risk of being shot .</context>

      <context> Then somebody else ? Do n't question , Rev had said , do n't invite danger . Her skin crawled : Lolotte had told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was open . Sarah had begun to tell Lucien of Emile , she had begun to question and a little <head>draft</head> had crept across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall . So Lolotte - or anybody - could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied_with the missing bottle of opium . That was not reasonable either . The opium had disappeared before Emile 's death and whoever shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen Sarah 's own doubts and suspicions - and questions .</context>
