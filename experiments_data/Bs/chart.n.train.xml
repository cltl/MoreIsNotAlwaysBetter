      <context> Knowing specifically what the many feed additives can do and_how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef , dairy , and sheep_men . The target <head>chart</head> quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what . All the additives listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food_and_Drug_Administration of the federal_government . All comments concerning effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with FDA . This article assumes that the rations you are feeding your beef , dairy_cattle , and sheep are adequately balanced with protein , vitamins , and minerals .</context>

      <context> The great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason . A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther . Instead of quelling the dissension , as many captains of the era would have done ( Sir_Francis_Drake lopped a man 's head off under similar circumstances ) , Hudson decided to be reasonable . He went_to his cabin and emerged carrying a large <head>chart</head> , which he set_up in_view of the crew . Patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives . When Hudson had finished , the `` town_meeting '' broke_down into a general , wordy argument . One man remarked that if he had a_hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in England .</context>

      <context> The moment the alarm goes_off , information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu , which is the center of the warning system . This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast_Survey stations in the Pacific which are equipped with seismographs . Its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami . By means of <head>charts</head> showing wave travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time_of_arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under_way at any spot in the Pacific . The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps . All_of these activities are geared to a top priority communication_system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly . Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence .</context>

      <context> The cry `` Garryowen '' ! bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes , Sioux and Apaches , Mexican banditos under Pancho_Villa , Japanese in the South_Pacific , and Chinese and North_Korean Communists in Korea . Garryowen is the battle_cry of the 7_th_U._S._Cavalry_Regiment , `` The Fighting_Seventh '' . Today a battle_cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern Army , esprit_de_corps has been sacrificed to organizational <head>charts</head> and tables . But do n't tell that to a veteran of the Fighting_Seventh , especially in a saloon on Saturday night . Of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7_th_Cav , perhaps no one knows its spirit better than Lieutenant_Colonel_Melbourne_C._Chandler . Wiry and burr_headed , with steel_blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals , Chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper .</context>

      <context> It is convenient to classify a child 's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according_to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line . When a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classified according_to the position of the dot with_respect_to the vertical marking denoting the mean age . Such classifications may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , reserving `` moderate '' for dots upon or close to the mean . In the lower portion of each <head>Chart</head> , the Skeletal Age ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified . There the middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age '' for the Maturity Series boys and girls . The upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard_deviation , and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard_deviation . Thus , a child 's Skeletal Age `` dots '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve .</context>

      <context> There the middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age '' for the Maturity Series boys and girls .

Thus , a child 's Skeletal Age `` dots '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve . To summarize the purpose of the Skeletal Maturity <head>Chart</head> : each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level of growth centers . First , the upper portion requires series of films for every child , consisting_of those from Hand , Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , and Foot . The lower portion necessitates only films of Hand . Second , the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round_bones of the five regions .</context>

      <context> The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood . Onsets , Completions , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile . It may be assumed that differences in ratings due_to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according_to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body . Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the <head>Chart</head> , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence . It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as_well_as Hand , it seems to be the method_of_choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood . As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions - particularly the former - provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period .</context>

      <context> Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . First , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . In contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . The Maturity <head>Chart</head> for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early_childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . Second , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . Although the standard_deviation values on which spread of the lines are based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . Third , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children .</context>

      <context> This operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant , with a slowly increasing load , over a reasonable period_of_time . The pilot plant was equipped with a 3 - hp turbine aerator ( Figure 2 ) . The aerator had a variable speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds . The sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and continuously recorded on 24 - hr <head>charts</head> . The raw sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents . The effluent was collected through two pipes and discharged to the Blue_River through a surface drainage_ditch . Composite samples were collected at weekly intervals .</context>
