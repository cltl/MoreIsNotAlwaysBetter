      <context> `` Life '' points_out that `` everybody uses this path '' , and starts to ride on . Piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from `` Life '' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather . His rage assumes a religious form ; that_is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life - not_only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as_well : `` all you light-headed breed '' . This <head>passion</head> brings_on a fit which proves fatal . Then an ambulance comes_along , and they drive Praisegod_Piepsam away . This is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant . The season , between spring and summer , belongs_to life in its carefree aspect .</context>

      <context> It is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations . As a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of Sweden 's ancient glory . He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part . Being somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe , for which he at_once developed a <head>passion</head> , so that he spent nearly all_of the following ten years abroad , at_first in Italy , then in Greece , Egypt , Asia_Minor , and Palestine . In one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth . Deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie_in that direction . He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` The_Happy_Artists '' .</context>

      <context> The portable record_player with a pile of classical records beside it . Beethoven 's Fifth was the one on top . Da-da-da-dum . Music could not be Eugene 's <head>passion</head> . Besides , the records were dusty . He tried the doors of the bookcase . Locked .</context>

      <context> `` It 's not for making pretty speeches about Dante those actresses get paid so good '' . `` Henh '' ! Calloused fingers , caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries , had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted , never to be tweezed away . Mauve colored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the <head>passion</head> of man 's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again_and_again . `` Puttana '' ! But if the Old_Man even thought_about his wife now , nobody cared_a_fig . It was enough for people to know that at_one_time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed - watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance , as thin as the seams on her stockings , and still thinner .</context>
