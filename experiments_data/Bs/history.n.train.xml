      <context> Modern man , as Dietrich_Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come_of_age '' ; and though this process by_no_means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in_fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it . In_any_event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at_all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen_fit to place us . To say this , of_course , is to take_up a position on one side of a controversy going_on now for some two hundred years , or , at_any_rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought . We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its <head>history</head> those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at_least , Bultmann .

It was the first time an English Primate has done this since the 14th century . English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope . Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants ; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary_school during the sickness of one of its masters ; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` Catholics , if the present system is still in_operation , will constitute almost one-third of the House_of_Lords in the next generation '' ; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic_church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave .</context>

      <context> Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no_doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' . His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary . That parallelism affects his picture of man 's disobedience too ; for as it was Christ , the Word_of_God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word_of_God in_the_beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe . With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of <head>history</head> , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality . At the nadir of that circuit is death . `` Along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience ; and disobedience to God entails death . Wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that [ moment ] they were handed_over to it '' .</context>

      <context> It is borne_out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next . It becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality . This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek speaking ones . They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and <head>history</head> . Death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience .

Consultation with architects , clients , real_estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work . Fortunately , although only a_few years ago they held the student at_arms_length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not_only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior_designer of tomorrow - that the student already is `` in the trade '' . Even the `` <head>history</head> of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern_slides . Here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced . The professional organizations such_as American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers , National_Society_of_Interior_Designers , Home_Fashions_League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work . Certainly every educator involved in interior_design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations .</context>

      <context> The Eichmann case looked_to the past , not to the future . It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as_long_as there are Jews . As_such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message '' . `` It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial '' - said Ben_Gurion , `` and not the Nazi regime alone - but anti-Semitism throughout <head>history</head> '' . How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-Semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ?

      <context> The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of_this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . In regard_to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of_this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of <head>history</head> and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light_mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on_trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as_well_as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ?</context>

They did n't seem to be able to think_of any . A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change .

      <context> To minimize the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government was formed a titre personnel and a special office was created in the Ministry_of_the_Interior to plan and to conduct the elections . By this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete . There remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws through the labyrinth of Palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions . From the rather tortuous <head>history</head> of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results . In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance . In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence , but in a system where there is as_yet no place for the less prominent . Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide , minority parties , such_as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958 , clamor for elections when out of power , but are not at_all certain they wish_to be controlled by popular choice when in power .</context>

      <context> Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded_as more hypothetical . While the U._S. Department_of_Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning . The U._S. Office_of_Education continues to stress local surveys rather_than national surveys . This procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long <head>history</head> of declining employment . Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in_order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training_programs for those skills . No effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained . Moreover , the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary .</context>

      <context> Even the states remain primarily in an assisting role , providing leadership and teacher training . Federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local districts must pay at_least half . The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . Throughout the <head>history</head> of the program , state_government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures , while local districts all_together have spent more_than either Federal or state_governments . Today , Federal funds account_for only one-fifth of the nation 's expenditures for vocational education . The greatest impact of the matching fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds . National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades .</context>

      <context> The historian can only point_out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding . Throughout the Dark_ages , it is clear , the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently . The pace could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood_on_firm_ground . The landscape of Greek <head>history</head> broadens widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century B.C. , the age of Homer 's `` rosy fingered Dawn '' . The first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world ; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change . For this period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; the ceramic material of the age is more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative_of the hopes and fears of its makers , who begin to show scenes of human life and death . Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece ; objects in gold , ivory , and bronze grow more numerous .</context>

      <context> The same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark_ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the survivals of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages . By 800 B.C. the Aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture . On these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the Iliad . Everywhere within the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; Greek <head>history</head> and culture were enduringly fertilized , and plagued , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors . Further we cannot go , for the Dark_ages deserve their name . Many aspects of civilization were not_yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure . The epic_poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the rise of firm political_units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men - all these had to await the progress of following decades .</context>

      <context> We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk_lore of the Greeks . In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original - a new thing . It is not merely a new thing ; it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; most_of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism . But to say that at a moment in <head>history</head> something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin_Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine 's encounter with man . New , indeed , is Luther 's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at . Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in_theory or in_practice . Consider the features of Utopian communism :</context>

Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist . It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that informs those details .

      <context> More believed that a man could be both serious and gay . That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all_too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of . Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ_Church and Regius_Professor of Ecclesiastical <head>History</head> , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance_English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . But to return to the main line of our inquiry . It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr . Utopia is still widely read because in_a_sense More stood on the margin of modernity .</context>

      <context> During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration_of_Independence . During the Brown trial , however , the state 's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence_Daily_Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not_only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal_governments . The Providence_Daily_Journal answered the Daily_Post by stating that the raid of John_Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican_Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' . The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify <head>history</head> . While the Daily_Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily_Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket_Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men .

      <context> Fear of the competition - always a great motivating force in the American economy - makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival 's shiny new branches . The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches . Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act_as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover . When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with <head>history</head> in the development of American retailing . Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easier than to the downtown department_store , though both are the same distance from home . Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown . Raymond_Vernon reports that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town .</context>
