      <context> In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university 's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist . However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals . In 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen_University , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 . During Oersted 's <head>attendance</head> at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences . He was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof._J._G._L._Manthey ( 1769 - 1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in_addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` Lion_Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him . Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted 's disposal during and after his graduation . In 1800 , Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion_Pharmacy .</context>
