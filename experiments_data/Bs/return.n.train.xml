      <context> In the 355 years since the first Guy_Fawkes_Night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a reminder '' . The article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill King_James_/1_1 , . In_spite_of the increase in numbers and prestige brought_about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840 's and 1850 's , the Catholic segment of England one_hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per_cent , or 800000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public . The <head>return</head> of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked_upon with indignant disapprobation and , in_fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty . In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in_order_to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers . Now , in 1961 , the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per_cent , or 5 million ) ; yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population . A Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going_in and out of the Birmingham_Oratory ( Catholic ) Church on Sunday mornings .</context>

      <context> Consider what happened during World_War_1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress . Many_of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful . With over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . With the <head>return</head> of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens . The attempt to enforce that belief ushered_in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history . The so-called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end . That tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society .</context>

      <context> I suppose we might classify Billy_Graham as an old liberal . And I would further note that they all - with one exception again - sang in one key or another the same song .
