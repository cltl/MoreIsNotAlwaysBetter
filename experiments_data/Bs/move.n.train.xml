      <context> A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens . Even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing_season . The worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily . He cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ; such a <head>move</head> may mean a loss of capital . Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of farm life . The farmer must get_up early , and , at_times , work late at night . Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain .</context>

      <context> When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river . Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort_Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland . The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort_Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food . The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their <head>move</head> southward by British fur traders . For many years the Northwest_Company had its southern headquarters at Prairie_du_Chien on the Mississippi_River , some 300 miles southeast of present-day St._Paul , Minnesota . When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United_States , its British born employees , now become American citizens - Joseph_Rolette , Joseph_Renville and Alexis_Bailly - continued in the fur business . On Big_Stone_Lake near the headwaters of the Red_River , Robert_Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian_Department of Canada , had a trading_post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces .</context>

      <context> But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job . There is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week . You can see it , for_example , in the extensive efforts President_Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by_the_way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past . What the next <head>move</head> will be only time , of_course , will tell . Personally , I think we ought to set_up an immediate naval_blockade of Cuba . We simply can n't tolerate further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba . Obviously , we can n't stop them from coming_in , however , just by talk .</context>

      <context> What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership . We cannot test public_opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action . I doubt , for_example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk_about what came to be the Marshall_plan , any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals . The problem in the policy officer 's mind thus begins to take_shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors - political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative - to be sorted_out and handled within a political_system which <head>moves</head> by consent in_relation_to an external environment which cannot be under_control . And the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping_at_his_heels .</context>

      <context> The equation was simple : wealth brought them happiness , and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had , let no_one in on the secrets . By comparison , Fritzie and Laura_Andrus were quivering fledglings . They possessed no outer fortifications , no hard shells of confidence ; they had enough difficulty getting from day to day , let_alone having an awful crime thrust upon them . Skopas expressed no curiosity over the case , offered no expression of sympathy , made no <head>move</head> to escort McFeeley to the door . All four remained impacted on the sofa until he had left . He had spoken_to Mrs._Emerson the previous day . There remained a family named Kahler , owners of a two story Tudor style house on the south_side of the Andrus home .</context>

      <context> He sighed . How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice . He would have_to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought_about , would be sweet indeed . His first <head>move</head> was to send Hino to the village to spend a_few days . His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print_shop , using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse . In_any_event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked , telling him to keep_his_ears_open while he was in the village to see if he could find_out what Kayabashi was planning . Hino was elated at the prospect .</context>

      <context> After Mr._Jack drove away , Winston went_on looking out the window . He noticed a speck of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger .

      <context> All_around the Mediterranean_Sea , Asia_Minor , northern India , and Tibet , Hebrew was the native tongue . In southern Europe , between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic_speaking peoples of northern Europe , was a thin but long stretch of territory called March . This was no_man's_land , disputed by the Haijac_Union and the Israeli_Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years . Neither nation would give_up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any <head>move</head> that might lead to a second Apocalyptic_War . So , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own borders ) . Its citizens spoke all_of the world 's surviving tongues , plus a new one called Lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet_of_paper .
