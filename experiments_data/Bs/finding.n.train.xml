      <context> One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster_Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more_than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's <head>findings</head> and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation_Of_Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities . I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town .</context>

      <context> In 1609 , the Dutch_East_India_Company hired Hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the Half_Moon , and supplied him with Dutch sailors . This time he turned westward , to the middle_Atlantic coast of North_America . His chief discovery was important - the Great_North ( later , the Hudson ) River - but it produced no northwest passage . When the Half_Moon put in at Dartmouth , England , in the fall of 1609 , word of Hudson 's <head>findings</head> leaked_out , and English interest in him revived . The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship . He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth . By springtime , he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry , Prince_of_Wales .</context>

      <context> Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature . Thus such great American documentaries as The_River and The_Plow_That_Broke_the_Plains were composed as visual stories rather_than as illustrated lectures . The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a French magician , Georges_Melies , and an American employee of Edison , Edwin_S._Porter . Of the two , Porter is justly the better_known , for he went far beyond the vital <head>finding</head> of fiction for films to take the first_step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion_picture the intricate , efficient time_machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands . Melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film . One of these is the `` dissolve '' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene . As the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear .</context>

      <context> Here I do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion . I mean something more like Freud 's concept of the utility of `` play '' to a small child : he plays `` house '' or `` doctor '' or `` fireman '' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control . There is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time . In B._M._Spinley 's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London , a salient <head>finding</head> was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience . Perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation . Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean . It is at_least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as_well_as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature .</context>

      <context> The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' . 353_U._S._,_at_589 . Thus , a <head>finding</head> of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision . Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du_Pont and General_Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute .</context>

      <context> We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints . The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition '' . 353_U._S._,_at_607 . On the basis of the <head>findings</head> which led to this conclusion , the Court remanded the case to the District_Court to determine the appropriate relief . The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed to it was this : `` The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the District_Court for a determination , after further hearing , of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute . The District_Courts , in the framing of equitable decrees , are clothed ' with large discretion to model their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case ' .

      <context> It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing_officer 's notes were furnished to the appeal board . Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board . Petitioner knew that the Department 's recommendation was based not on the hearing_officer 's report but on the statement of the local board in his file . Having had every opportunity to rebut the <head>finding</head> of the local board before both the hearing_officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due_process because he did not succeed . It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing_officer 's report and notes at the trial . In_addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes . While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process .</context>

      <context> For_example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related_to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such_as those found in types 1 , and 3 , . One might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse . In_addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog . Anatomically , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our <head>findings</head> in the horse with those of others ( Birnbaum , ' 54 ) in the human_being . The only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard_to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries . As early as 1858 , Le_Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries in human_beings . In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz .</context>

      <context> Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin . Its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems , nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in_vitro been unequivocally proven . There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination , for in certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments ( Wolff , Robbins and Rall , 1959 ) . Similar <head>findings</head> have been noted in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzymes , whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide . In_addition , depending_on availability of dietary iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine . Since the circulating thyroid_hormones are the amino_acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine ( cf. Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid_gland for their release from proteins before secretion . The presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid .</context>

Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid_gland for their release from proteins before secretion . The presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid .

The <head>finding</head> that the concentration of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid_glands from TSH treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in_vivo . There is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known . A study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediates ( Alpers , Petermann and Rall , 1956 ) . Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes .</context>

Although the Taylor_Scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items .

      <context> If it were wholly random and unrelated , it would be 2.0 , assuming the five classes were equal in n , which approximately they are . The actual mean of 1.07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement . In 1960 , David_D._Thomas published Basic Vocabulary in some Mon_Khmer Languages AL 2 , no. 3 , pp. 7 - 11 ) , which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages with the I-E language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate ( * * f ) in_place_of original ( * * f ) , and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in Towards_Greater_Accuracy ( IJAL_21_:_121_-_137 ) . Thomas ' <head>findings</head> are , first , `` that the individual items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence '' ; but , second , `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence '' ( as between M-K and I-E . His first conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on Ath. and Yok . ) was partially positive . His second conclusion , on semantic word_classes , agrees with mine . This second conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored .</context>

      <context> As to relative_frequencies of competing roots ( 7 - 1 vs. 4 - 4 , etc_. ) , Thomas with his ' weighting ' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have . The problem needs further exploration . I was at_least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication , in which , in listing ' Two_Stem_Meanings ' , I set_off by asterisks those forms in which n of stem B was * * f of stem A_3 , the unasterisked ones standing_for * * f ; or under ' Four_Stems ' , I set_off by asterisks cases where the combined n of stems * * f was * * f . These <head>findings</head> , and_others which will in_time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry . If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per_cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per_cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller . And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones .</context>
