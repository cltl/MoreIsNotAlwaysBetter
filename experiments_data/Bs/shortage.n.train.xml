      <context> Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it 's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash_register . Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution_costs ; and translate the whole into profit_and_loss and balance_sheet figures which management can act_on with some assurance ? We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans - and management could n't make_up_its_mind . There is a <head>shortage</head> of salesmen today . In the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still . While many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel , much of it has been product rather than sales training . Nor has the training been enough in_relation_to the need .</context>

      <context> Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed . Family_planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring . Pope_Pius_12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long_time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such_as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications '' . This means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the <head>shortage</head> of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring . These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics in family_planning . The laws of many states permit birth_control only for medical reasons . The Roman_Catholic_Church , however , sanctions a much more liberal policy on family_planning .</context>

      <context> Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round . Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony on the Red prompted the United_State War_Department in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel_Henry_Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie_du_Chien , until then the most advanced United_States post . In September 1822 two companies of infantry arrived_at the mouth of the St._Peter's_River , the head of navigation on the Mississippi , and began construction of Fort_St._Anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in_honor_of its commander , Colonel_Josiah_Snelling . It was from the American outposts that Red_River <head>shortages</head> of livestock were to be made good . Hercules_L._Dousman , fur trader and merchant at Prairie_du_Chien , contracted to supply Selkirk 's people with some 300 head of cattle , and Alexis_Bailly and Francois_Labothe were hired as drovers . Bailly , after leaving Fort_Snelling in August 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson's_Bay_Company's post on Lake_Traverse `` in the Sieux_Country '' and reached Fort_Garry , as the Selkirk Hudson's_Bay_Company center was now called , late in the fall . He set_out on his 700 - mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward the United_States .</context>

      <context> But I think that something more than this is involved . How did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New_England as it did in other parts of the country ? Is n't it a_bit odd that the three states of Southern New_England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode_Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A_+_M_colleges ? Was it supposed , perchance , that A_+_M ( vocational_training , that_is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant_class which flooded that part of the New_England world in the post Civil_War period , the immigrants having been brought_in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make_up for the labor <head>shortage</head> caused by migration to the West ? Is it not ironical that Roger_Williams 's state , Rhode_Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? The state universities of Maine , New_Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; they had less immigration to contend with . A Yale historian , writing a_few years ago in The Yale_Review , said : `` We in New_England have long_since segregated our children '' .</context>

      <context> Be it enacted by the Senate and House_of_Representatives of the United_States_of_America in Congress assembled , That the Act of July 3 , 1952 ( 66 Stat. 328 ) as amended ( 42 U._S._C. 1952 - 1958 ) , is further amended to read as_follows : In_view_of the increasing <head>shortage</head> of usable surface and ground_water in many parts of the Nation and the importance of finding new sources of supply to meet its present and future water needs , it is the policy of the Congress to provide_for the development of practicable low-cost means for the large-scale production of water of a quality suitable for municipal , industrial , agricultural , and other beneficial consumptive uses from saline water , and for studies and research related thereto .
