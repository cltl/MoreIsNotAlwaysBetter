      <context> The early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience ; the later works were conceived to affirm a way_of_life for fellow citizens . However , in all of Prokofieff 's music , young or mature , we find his profile - his `` signature '' - his craftsman 's attitude . Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per_se . In orchestration , he stretches the <head>limits</head> of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color . His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable . His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle . His counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick .</context>

      <context> The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass . Folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it . The folk are simply not homogeneous with_respect_to nation or political attitude . In_fact , there is much evidence to indicate they do n't care a_bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational <head>limits</head> . Nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for `` the_good_old_days '' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of Americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk .</context>

      <context> One of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide . Sensibility is a vague word , covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent , quality , or skill . Among_other_things it means perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle differences . Both the extent to which this is true and the <head>limits</head> of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged . Its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the English_professor with whom one attends the theatre . The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of English_professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor_cars , political candidates , or female beauty . Along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than I have seen .</context>

In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon_Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human_beings and events . But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap .</context>

The transducer is a null type instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm , 0.001 in. thick and 1 in. in diameter .

      <context> It has recently become practical to use the radio_emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . The results of present observations of the thermal radio_emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared_emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set <head>limits</head> on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . Observations of the radio_emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to_a_greater_extent than those using shorter wave_lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . Radio_observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . The observed intensity of the radio_emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave_lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black_body at about 600 ` K .</context>

      <context> The observable characteristics of planetary radio_radiation are the intensity , the polarization , and the direction of arrival of the waves . The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute_of_arc . This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction , and consequently the radio_emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved . It should be possible , however , to put useful <head>limits</head> on the diameters of the radio_sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers . Measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth . There have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation . The measurements made with the NRL 50 - foot reflector , which is altitude azimuth mounted , would have shown a systematic change with local hour_angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized .</context>

      <context> A drawing of the structure is to be_found in reference 6 . The gross details of the structure appear reasonable . The structure appears to be unique among ROOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by **f . The bond angles and distances are all within the expected <head>limits</head> and the volume per oxygen is about normal . However , the possible absence of a center of symmetry not_only moves the hydrogen_atom off **f , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent , with **f at **f and **f at **f ( space group **f ) , where **f represents the oxygens on one side of the **f layers and **f those on the other side . However , any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short **f interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non hydrogen_bonded **f interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 A . Hence it is difficult to conceive_of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence .</context>

Also , interlobular air drifts may be all_but nonexistent in the cow ; probably occur in the horse much_as in the human_being ; and , in contrast are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent ( Van_Allen and Lindskog , ' 31 ) . A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at_present . Within certain wide <head>limits</head> anatomy dictates function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as_well . For_example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related_to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such_as those found in types 1 , and 3 , . One might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse . In_addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog .</context>

      <context> Obviously , a vicious_cycle develops . This tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways . It is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism . Before we comment further on these pathological conditions , we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological <head>limits</head> distinguish sleep from wakefulness . Thus , a low intensity of hypothalamic cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition . Moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induces , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous_system . With the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur .</context>

      <context> They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail . Public indignation and resistance to wage price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3 % per_annum than when the increases are on the order of 3 % per month . The simple passage of an additional eleven months ' time makes the second 3 % boost more acceptable . Thus , the public <head>limit</head> price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase . Notice , however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per_se , without an accompanying wage increase . Similarly , higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase . This is not extended to anticipated levels of GNP , however - only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against wage price increases .</context>

      <context> The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price_competition , but which is so basic that its wage price policies are held in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . In_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public <head>limit</head> pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells_out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages . Part 1 , below describes this abstract model by spelling_out its assumptions . Part 2 , discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant conclusions .</context>

      <context> The threat of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of endangering relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases . For the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry limited price ( but not below average_cost ) . For such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs ( due_to rising wages , etc . ) . Thus , if public pressure sets the effective <head>limit</head> to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate . In this model , we abstract from all non wage sources of cost changes , so that the `` public limit price '' only rises as the wage rate rises . In such circumstances , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate . Since marginal_costs rise when the wage rate rises , the profit_maximizing price also rises when the public limit price is elevated , and is likely to remain well above the latter .</context>

Private international_law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international_law proper , or , as it is often called , public international_law . States were free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate <head>limits</head> , their own rules as_to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law_merchant , and to enact legislation with regard_to many claims arising on the high_seas . The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in_fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations .</context>

      <context> Or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big house , a Van_Rensselaer bride from way upstate near Albany , from Rensselaerwyck . And this handsome booby , staring and sweating , was he her bridegroom ? Martha picked_up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom . David_Cortlandt was tired beyond almost the <head>limits</head> of his flesh . He had ridden hard from Boston , and he was not used_to horseback . Now , driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer_Schuyler , he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move . The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather_than the Hudson_River Valley of his boyhood memories .</context>

      <context> The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent . On all sides doors were being slammed in his face . The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity . Now , under the impact of his wife 's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a <head>limit</head> to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be . He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half_sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted_in would involve them in a common ruin . For_the_moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity . But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing .</context>
