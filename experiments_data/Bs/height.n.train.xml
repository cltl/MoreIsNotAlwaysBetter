      <context> Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had_to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge . For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned . One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had_to tell how children had been selected by <head>height</head> for the gas_chambers . The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten - the gas_chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star_of_David - nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . Public_relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried_out : Too_much , too_much - the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had_to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot .</context>

      <context> In the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles_per_hour . Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable . Their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest . Usually it is only_when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build_up to their terrifying <head>heights</head> . On the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan , fishermen at_sea noticed no unusual swells . Not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened . The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore .</context>

      <context> Attorney_General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more_than 4000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights . Then , not many years later , the Un-American_Activities_Committee , under the leadership of Martin_Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens . Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government .

      <context> The data reported here are either from spectra from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples evacuated and sealed_off at 375 ` C which contain no adsorbed water . The measured powder density of the **f used here was about **f , approximately one-third that of the crystal density ( **f ) . Such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of about **f . Spectra were obtained from a powdered sample having the shape of a right circular cylinder with a <head>height</head> to diameter ratio of 4 : 1 . The top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical . Spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube . The bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary .</context>

      <context> Similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping , or organification , or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis . The name thyroid-stimulating_hormone ( TSH ) has been given to a substance found in the anterior pituitary_gland of all species of animal so_far tested for its presence . The hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic_hormone . At the present_time we do not know by what biochemical_mechanism TSH acts_on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean <head>height</head> of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of * * f . Here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of TSH in blood . Brown ( 1959 ) has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying TSH , and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject . As long_ago as 1851 it was pointed_out by Niepce ( 1851 ) that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid .</context>
