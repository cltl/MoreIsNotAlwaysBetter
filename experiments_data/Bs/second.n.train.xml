      <context> Whitey_Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base_on_balls . Then three consecutive pinch_hitters failed to produce . Pete_Ward was sent in_for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short . John_Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2 - and 2 pitches , and Buddy_Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced_out sharply to Jerry_Lumpe at <head>second</head> to end the 2 - hour and - 27 - minute contest . The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ_Snyder 's single to right and crossed on Kunkel 's wild_pitch into the dirt in_front of the plate . The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out . Jackie_Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally .</context>

Jim_Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel 's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first_baseman Throneberry 's head Brandt took third and Gentile <head>second</head> on the error . Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners . When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut_down in a close play at third , Tuttle to Andy_Carey . The detailed rundown on the Kansas_City scoring in the sixth went like this :</context>

      <context> It should be installed over a door that is in_full_view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a_little to one side . Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin_up each time they pass under it . Those who are too weak , should climb_on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down . When they can take ten <head>seconds</head> to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin_up . Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home . Arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the Horse_Kick .

      <context> Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out . Try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands . The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide . Let the body down slowly , taking at_least five <head>seconds</head> for the letting_down . Five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up . Handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at_least a minimum of strength . Of_course those who have developed more will find them easier .</context>

      <context> One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched . A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed . Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood_vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy . The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per <head>second</head> thus it takes about 16 | msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue . A sonar or radar type of pulse_generator and time-delay_measuring_system is required for body tissue evaluation . In_addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique . The Doppler_effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood_vessel .</context>

      <context> Battery life limited the use of this `` pill '' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum . A refinement of this technique has been described by Drs._Zworykin and Farrar and Mr._Berkely of the Medical_Electronics_Center of the Rockefeller_Institute . In this novel arrangement the `` pill '' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in_which the capacitor is formed by a pressure sensing transducer . As shown in Fig. 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a <head>second</head> with short 400 - kc. bursts . The energy received by the `` pill '' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ringing '' takes_place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' . These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained . One of the advantages of_this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions .</context>

      <context> These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; the specimen is magnified by the microscope . Instead of the observer 's eye the image_orthicon in the TV_camera does the `` looking '' .

The video signal is amplified and then switched , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet_light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a <head>second</head> only one wavelength , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen . ( Note : Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are switched by a commutator like assembly rotated by a synchronous_motor .

      <context> Space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions . If the fourth_dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? It is not through space nor time that the time_machine most approved by science_fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever existent past fantasy future . Three <head>seconds</head> flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events . The body , senses and brain , in_common_with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies . The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them . Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions .</context>

      <context> At_first I did not know what she meant ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home city . Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . At another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother introject began to emerge more_and_more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' ! I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; but a_few <head>seconds</head> later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you '' !

      <context> a voice called , and what made it even more terrible and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant , only some of them glancing toward the stone_wall , from behind which the voice came . The front of their column had already passed us , when another officer came riding down the side of the road , not five paces from where we were . My Cousin_Simmons carried a musket , but he had loaded it with bird_shot , and as the officer came opposite him , he rose_up behind the wall and fired . One moment there was a man in the saddle ; the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through the redcoat ranks , and during the next <head>second</head> or two , we all_of us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers . One moment , the road was filled with disciplined troops , marching four by four with a purpose as implacable as death ; the next , a cloud of gun_smoke covered a screaming fury of sound , out of which the redcoat soldiers emerged with their bayonets and their cursing fury . In the course of_this , they had fired on us ; but I have no memory of_that . I had squeezed the trigger of my own gun , and to my amazement , it had fired and kicked_back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule ; and then I was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound , hurling more vile language than I ever thought I knew , sobbing and shouting , and aware that if I had passed_water before , it was not enough , for my pants were soaking wet .</context>

I must state that the faster things happened , the slower they happened ; the passage and rhythm of time changed , and when I remember back to what happened then , each event is a separate and frozen incident . In my recollection , there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats , and in that interval the dust_cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely . Yet it could not have been more than a matter of <head>seconds</head> , and then the front of the British army came into view . It was only hours since I had last seen them , but they had changed and I had changed . In the very front rank , two men were wounded and staggered along , trailing blood behind them . No drummers here , no pipers , and the red_coats were covered with a fine film of dust .</context>

For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five <head>seconds</head> to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor . The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue_pie , gets a plate of English_muffins instead .</context>
