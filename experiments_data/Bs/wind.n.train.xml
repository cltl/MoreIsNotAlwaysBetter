      <context> Gaining her second straight victory , Norman_B._Small_,_Jr. 's Garden_Fresh , a 3 - year old filly , downed promising colts in the $ 4500 St._Patrick's_Day_Purse , featured seventh race here today , and paid $ 7.20 straight . Toying_with her field in the early stages , Garden_Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip_Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3 - 5 for the 7 furlongs . Richard_M._Forbes 's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in_front of Glen_T._Hallowell 's Milties_Miss . A bright sun and brisk <head>wind</head> had the track in a fast condition for_the_first_time this week and 8280 St._Patty_Day celebrants bet $ 842617 on the well prepared program . Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James_P._Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . Garden_Fresh , the result of a mating of Better_Self and Rosy_Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St._Patrick's_Day_Purse with some speed in reserve . She was moving_up to the allowance department after winning a $ 10000 claiming event .</context>

      <context> In recent years many counties and the U._S._Forest_Service have taken aerial photos which show features in_detail and are very good for planning use . Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor 's office showing ownerships of land . Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation . This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and <head>wind</head> , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons . It is usually helpful to make a sketch_map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site . These are a great aid for planning use back at the office . For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry_through the study .</context>

      <context> He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on_board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend , where the Discovery picked him up . For the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of Great_Britain , then turned westward . On May 11 , she reached Iceland . Poor <head>winds</head> and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` Lousie_Bay '' . The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome . With Hudson looking_on , his protege Greene picked a fight with the ship 's surgeon , Edward_Wilson .

      <context> The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards_of_measurement . An ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a_few hundred feet long from crest to crest - no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1000 feet in the Pacific . But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest . While a <head>wind</head> wave never travels at more than 60 miles_per_hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles_per_hour . The greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave ; Lagrange 's law says that its velocity is equal to the square_root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due_to gravity . In the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles_per_hour . Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable .</context>

      <context> On the basis of its life_history , we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees . The way in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect , either . It lacks pollen baskets and possesses only a large_number of long , branched hairs on its legs , on which the pollen grains will collect . Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks_like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the <head>wind</head> . Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali_bees . Nomia_melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United_States west of the Great_Plains , for_example , in Utah and central Washington . In the United_States Department_of_Agriculture 's Yearbook_of_Agriculture , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects , George_E._Bohart mentions a site in Utah which was estimated to contain 200000 nesting females .</context>

      <context> I must add at_once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold_weather . Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50 ` F and there is not too_much <head>wind</head> . Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a_couple_of those wonderful flowering currants such_as the red Ribes_sanguineum of our Pacific_Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy_willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins . The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large_numbers of our early insects will assemble : honeybees , bumblebees , and other wild bees , and also various kinds of flies . It is a happy , buzzing crowd .</context>

      <context> In 1879 the same Clark_Wait , with H._H._Holley of South_Dorset , formed the `` American_Telegraph_Line '' , extending from Manchester_Depot via Factory_Point and South_Dorset to Dorset . Besides being most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good investment for the owners '' . Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron_C._Burr and Mark_Manley of `` Burr_and_Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry_goods . Early equipment was very flimsy ; the smallest gusts of <head>wind</head> toppled poles , making communications impossible . But companies continued to spring_up . By 1883 the `` Battenkill_Telegraph_Company '' was in existence and Alvin_Pettibone was its president . Operating in 1887 was the `` Valley_Telegraph_Line '' , officers of which were E._C._Orvis , president ; H._K._Fowler , vice-president and secretary ; J._N._Hard , treasurer ; F._H._Walker , superintendent ; H._S._Walker , assistant superintendent .</context>
