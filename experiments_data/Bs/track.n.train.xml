      <context> Gaining her second straight victory , Norman_B._Small_,_Jr. 's Garden_Fresh , a 3 - year old filly , downed promising colts in the $ 4500 St._Patrick's_Day_Purse , featured seventh race here today , and paid $ 7.20 straight . Toying_with her field in the early stages , Garden_Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip_Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3 - 5 for the 7 furlongs . Richard_M._Forbes 's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in_front of Glen_T._Hallowell 's Milties_Miss . A bright sun and brisk wind had the <head>track</head> in a fast condition for_the_first_time this week and 8280 St._Patty_Day celebrants bet $ 842617 on the well prepared program . Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James_P._Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . Garden_Fresh , the result of a mating of Better_Self and Rosy_Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St._Patrick's_Day_Purse with some speed in reserve . She was moving_up to the allowance department after winning a $ 10000 claiming event .</context>

      <context> As we have already seen in the first chapter , bumblebees are bigger , hairier , and much more colorful than honeybees , exhibiting various combinations of black , yellow , white and orange . Let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them Bombus ; there must be several dozen species in the United_States alone . If you really insist on knowing their names , an excellent book on the North_American species is Bumblebees and Their Ways by O._E._Plath . If we manage to keep <head>track</head> of a Bombus queen after she has left her feeding place , we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed_up for herself when she woke_up from her winter sleep . As befits a queen , a bumblebee female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable nesting_place . Most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such_as a deserted mouse_nest , a bird_house , or the hole made by a woodpecker ; some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss . Once she has made_up_her_mind , the queen starts_out by constructing , in her chosen abode , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some woolly material .</context>

      <context> Stevie yearned for a dog . He wondered whether God had a dog in the sky . He meandered down Pike_Street , past the First_National_Bank with its green window_shades . He crossed the <head>tracks</head> to Delaware_House , where ladies in gay dresses and men in straw boaters and waxed mustaches crowded the verandah . A tall lady , with a ruffled collar very low on her bosom , turned insolent green eyes upon him . She was taller than Aggie . She was so beautiful with her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked .</context>

      <context> His money was tied_up in a Nassau hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been running against him . His worries harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window . In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves . During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the <head>track</head> , and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga . Maple and ash , beech and elm , one_hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one_hundred to win on Two in the eighth . Children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage . Then , getting_back into bed , he thought unashamedly of Mrs._Flannagan , planning where they would next meet and what they would do .</context>

      <context> But there was water . There was an artificial_lake just out_of_sight in the first stand of trees , fed by a half dozen springs that popped_out of the ground above the hillside orchard . Yes , there was plenty of water , too_much , and that was probably the trouble . There were <head>tracks</head> of cattle all_over his six hundred and forty acres . The first part of the road was steep , but it leveled_off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley . It was hotter once they reached the flat , and drier , but the grass was better . A warm breeze played across it , moving it like waves .</context>

      <context> He heaved the dead man onto the buckboard , yelled and lashed at the team and got_out of there fast . But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing . A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman 's hiding_place . There were no <head>tracks</head> of either hoofs or boots . Not even an empty cartridge case could be found . Once_again , Tom_Horn was the first and most likely suspect , and he was brought_in for questioning immediately . Once_again , he shook his head , kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready .</context>

      <context> A split_second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sounded . He 'd mounted_up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he 'd estimated the shot had come . But he had found all_of the thickets and points of cover deserted . There had been no sign of a rifleman and no <head>track</head> or trace to show that anyone had been near . Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing . He had n't even pretended to be farming his spread . His land had never been plowed .</context>

      <context> His eyes widened . While five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry , with Gyp_Carmer a prominent figure , it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday . Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen . A man knocked the roulette_ball about idly in its <head>track</head> , and another dozed at one of the card_tables . Two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar , while the sleek headed bartender absently polished a glass . Looking the setup over , Stevens started coolly for the rear of the place . `` Where yuh goin '' ' ?</context>
