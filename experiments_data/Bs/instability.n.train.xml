      <context> Who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin ? Who but Nikita himself ? Since he has just shown who is top_dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the Soviet people . Besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the <head>instability</head> of death which , what with exhumations and rehabilitations , seems to match that of life . Suppose he did lie beside Lenin , would it be permanent ? If some future Khrushchev decided to rake_up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory_workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ? When a man is laid_to_rest , he is entitled to stay_put .</context>

      <context> His counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick . Also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured_bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required . That Prokofieff 's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original '' than we prefer to believe . Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and <head>instability</head> . Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated . At this date , it seems probable that the name of Serge_Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History , as an effective Traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ; yet was never caught_up in it - never a slave to its academic dialectics . Certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World - not his experimentations .</context>
