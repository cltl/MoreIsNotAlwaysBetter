      <context> The handwriting is on_the_wall . The only hope for West_Berlin lies_in a compromise which will bring_down the wall and reunite the city . State_Department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary , and driving two blocks into East_Berlin under military escort , will not avail . Tanks lined_up at the <head>border</head> will be no_more helpful . The materials for compromise are at_hand : The Nation , Walter_Lippmann and other sober commentators ( see Alan_Clark on p. 367 ) have spelled them out again_and_again . A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph , but it will save Berlin . Or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence , if that is what the West wants .</context>

      <context> ( An unheated greenhouse would have been better , if I had had one . ) The plants took zero nights in their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them . In response to the lengthening days of February they budded , then bloomed their 4 - inch velvety flowers . That cold_frame was my morale_builder ; its mass of bright bloom set in a <head>border</head> of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it . Like strawberries in December , pansies are far more exciting in February than in May . Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired_of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it . The day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plants becoming `` leggy '' , running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms .</context>

      <context> We flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they did n't crash . In_the_end we ran_into Communist artillery_fire . `` We '' were Bill_Garrett of the National_Geographic Illustrations_Staff , whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met ; Boun_My , our interpreter ; and myself . Boun_My - the name means one who has a boun , a celebration , and is therefore lucky - was born in Savannakhet , the <head>Border</head> of Paradise . He had attended three universities in the United_States . But he had never seen the mountainous half of his native_land north of Vientiane , including the royal capital , Luang_Prabang . Before the airplanes came , he said , travel in Laos was just_about impossible .</context>

      <context> Asked which institution most needs correction , I would say the corporation as it exists in America today . At_first_glance this appears strange : of all people , was not America founded by rugged_individualists who established a new way_of_life still inspiring `` undeveloped '' societies abroad ? But hear Harrison_E._Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The_New_York_Times , and author of `` To_Moscow_-_And_Beyond '' . In a book review of `` The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State_Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West_Contacts_Staff in_order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet <head>borders</head> , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy_and_Bess ' overrode the State_Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz_musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo_montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry_Ford , Hugh_Cooper , Thomas_Campbell , the International_Harvester_Co. , and David_W._Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' .</context>

      <context> His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers . Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic_romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in_particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry_James and James_Joyce among them . His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him . My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the <head>borders</head> of the South , but rather that he has looked_at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by_no_means new with him , and most_of the problems he takes_up have had the attention of authors before him . A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region . The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at_least since John_Pendleton_Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank_Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature .</context>

      <context> Literally , there was nothing else to do . He was caught in a machine . But Sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly : `` Let 's go and see what it_'s like '' . Annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham , near the Georgia <head>border</head> and on the Tallahoosa_River , a small and dirty stream . The city was a center of manufacture , especially in textiles , and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings , a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama . But it had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black_Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived - servants and laborers huddled_together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime . Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city over ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were .</context>

      <context> In southern Europe , between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic_speaking peoples of northern Europe , was a thin but long stretch of territory called March . This was no_man's_land , disputed by the Haijac_Union and the Israeli_Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years . Neither nation would give_up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic_War . So , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own <head>borders</head> ) . Its citizens spoke all_of the world 's surviving tongues , plus a new one called Lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet_of_paper . Hal saw in his mind the rest of Earth : Iceland , Greenland , the Caribbean_Islands , and the eastern half of South_America . Here the peoples spoke the tongue of Iceland because that island had gotten_the_jump_on the Hawaiian Americans who were busy resettling North_America and the western half of South_America after the Apocalyptic_War .</context>
