When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system - a system which the party opposes in its platform .</context>

      <context> The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however . It was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone_calls and veiled threats of violence . The former county school_superintendent , George_P._Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school_board . During the election campaign , both <head>candidates</head> , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone_calls . Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election . Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election . Sheriff_Felix_Tabb said the ordinary apparently made_good his promise .</context>

      <context> If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand . The appointment of U_Thant of Burma as the U.N.'s Acting Secretary_General - at this writing , the choice appears to be certain - offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends . Mongi_Slim of Tunisia and Frederick_Boland of Ireland were early favorites in_the_running , but France did n't like the former and the Soviet_Union would have none of the latter . With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr._Hammarskjold , U_Thant emerged as the only possible <head>candidate</head> unlikely to be waylaid by a veto . What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy . In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers_game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat . He has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future .</context>

      <context> However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever . O_'_Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal . On Election_Day - November 4 - he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes . The result was a landslide for the Republican <head>candidates</head> . This further demonstration of O_'_Banion 's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone . In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self_aggrandisement for their liking . He behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness .</context>

      <context> I will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year . The earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise , sponsored by Life magazine , under the title of the National purpose . The contributors to this testament were all well-known : a former Democratic <head>candidate</head> for President , a New_Deal poet , the magazine 's chief editorial writer , two newspaper_columnists , head of a national broadcasting_company , a popular Protestant evangelist , etc. . What I want to point_out here is that all_of them are ex liberals , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception . I suppose we might classify Billy_Graham as an old liberal . And I would further note that they all - with one exception again - sang in one key or another the same song .</context>

      <context> Among_other_things it means perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle differences . Both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged . Its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the English_professor with whom one attends the theatre . The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of English_professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor_cars , political <head>candidates</head> , or female beauty . Along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than I have seen . In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon_Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human_beings and events . But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap .</context>

      <context> The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive - and the rate_of_attrition due_to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high . It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired - and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed . Roleplaying was offered as a solution - and the procedure worked as_follows : all <head>candidates</head> were invited to a hotel conference_room , where the president explained the difficulty he had , and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work_out . In_place_of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires , checking their references , interviewing them , asking them to be tried_out , he told them he would prefer to test them . Each person was to enter the testing_room , carrying a suitcase of samples . Each salesman was to read a sheet containing a description of the product .</context>

      <context> The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco . At the central level the scrutin_uninominal_voting_system was selected over some form of the scrutin_de_liste_system , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political_parties . The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections . Although the elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their <head>candidates</head> . With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly . Both parties and the Ministry_of_the_Interior were busily at_work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance . Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation .</context>

      <context> The general setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization . The concentration of effective power in Rabat leads not_only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in_addition to contributing to more meaningful elections . Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber_of_Commerce elections , which took_place three weeks before national elections . The Istiqlal sponsored U.M.C.I.A. ( L'Union_Marocaine_des_Commercants , Industrialistes_et_Artisans ) was opposed by <head>candidates</head> of the new U.N.F.P. ( L'Union_National_des_Forces_Populaires ) in nearly all urban_centers . As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen , the U.M.C.I.A. was generally favored against the more progressive , labor based U.N.F.P. The newer party campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small_businessmen to support them as they had done for many years . The local Istiqlal and U.M.C.I.A. offices did not campaign and lost heavily . The value of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as shown in Table /1 , .</context>

      <context> Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances . A third aspect , and probably the one open_to most controversy , is the results of the election . The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested parties , including the government itself , were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful <head>candidates</head> the month following the elections . The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics . Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence . They were stressed in the speeches of Si_Mubarak_Bekkai when the first Council_of_Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council .</context>

      <context> The new Council was itself inescapably of political meaning , which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U.N.F.P. members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders . Since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections , and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the U.N.F.P. Voting preparations began in the fall of 1959 , although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes was completed in 1958 . There were three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of voters and the registration of <head>candidates</head> . Voter registration began in late November 1959 and continued until early January , 1960 . The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response . Periodic bulletins of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial officials .</context>

      <context> Until the Charter_of_Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes . The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 , but the P.D.I. ( Parti_Democratique_de_l'Independance ) , the most important minor party at the time , objected to the Istiqlal 's predominance in the civil_service and influence in Radio_Maroc . There were rumors that the Ministry_of_the_Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings . The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of <head>candidates</head> and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be supported by the King himself . The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called_in and notices of further investigation appeared from_time_to_time . In January , 1958 , the Minister_of_the_Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied .</context>
