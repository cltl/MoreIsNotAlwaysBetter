      <context> George_Kerr , the swift striding Jamaican , set a meet record in the 600 - yard run in the Knights_of_Columbus track_meet tonight , beating Purdue 's Dave_Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . Kerr , who set the world_record earlier this month in New_York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped_out Mills 's early pace and beat the young Big_10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal_Whitfield . Mills shot out in_front and kept the <head>lead</head> through two thirds of the race . Then Kerr , a graduate_student from Illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held_off Mills 's challenge on the final turn . Mills was timed in 1.10.4 . The crowd at the twenty-first annual K._of_C._Games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a_few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one week old world_record in the half-mile run .</context>

      <context> The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton_Davidson throwing only 17 passes . `` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack '' , explained Stram . `` They can be going_along , doing little damage , then bang , bang - they can hit a_couple_of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in_trouble '' . The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final_period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a <head>lead</head> to hold them off . The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner_Haynes , the flashy halfback . He was called_upon 26 times - more than all_of the other ball carriers combined - and delivered 145 yards . The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver 's Al_Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave_Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al_Reynolds claimed it for Dallas .</context>

Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted 's disposal during and after his graduation . In 1800 , Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion_Pharmacy . In February 1801 , Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic_battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and <head>lead</head> . In the following year , 1803 , Oersted , simultaneously with Davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic_battery more_than did salts . Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded_down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' . He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood .</context>

      <context> The association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic_forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades . Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles . In the late 1700 's Beccaria and van_Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it . Beccaria had almost stumbled on a <head>lead</head> to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden_jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch spring steel making its ends magnetic . The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise . The experiments of Romagnosi and_others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause and effect relationship between these two primary forces . Oersted 's own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting_wire across the compass needle instead_of parallel with_it .</context>

      <context> This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element . A high-speed shutter has been developed in_order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion . The shutter consists_of two parts : a fast opening part and a fast closing part . Using Edgerton 's method , the fast closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel <head>lead</head> wires . The fast opening of the shutter consists_of a piece of aluminum_foil ( approximately * * f ) placed directly in_front of the camera_lens so that no light may pass into the camera .

      <context> It was because of this chain-reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_objects , or at_least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there . Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities . Synthetic_Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this was the_point at which he finally took the <head>lead</head> in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it . But even before that , Picasso had glimpsed and entered , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him . It was as though , in_that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all_the_way back - or forward - to literal three-dimensionality . This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in_general ) literally into the literal space in_front of the picture_plane .</context>
