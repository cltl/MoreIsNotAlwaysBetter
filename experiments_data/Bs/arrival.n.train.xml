      <context> R._H._S._Crossman , M.P. , writing in The_Manchester_Guardian , states that departures from West_Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a week . The official statistics show that 60 per_cent are employed workers or independent professional people . Whole families are moving and removal_firms are booked for months ahead . The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 <head>arrivals</head> each_week from West_Germany , but the hard truth , says Crossman , is that `` The closing_off of East_Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East_German , as distinct from Russian , troops was a major Communist victory , which dealt West_Berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow . The gallant half city is dying on_its_feet '' . Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in the Observer ( London ) . Mark_Arnold-Foster writes : `` People are leaving [ West_Berlin ] because they think it is dying .</context>

      <context> To reduce incidence of liver abscesses , supply 75 milligrams of oxytetracycline activity per head daily . To prevent or treat bacterial diarrhea , furnish 0.1 to 5 milligrams per pound of body_weight daily . For the prevention or treatment of the early stages of shipping_fever complex , increase feeding level to 0.5 to 2 grams per head per day . For the best results , feed this level to cattle 3 to 5 days preceding shipment and / or 3 to 5 days following their <head>arrival</head> in your feed_lot . For treatment of shipping_fever , this level should be fed at the onset of the disease symptoms until symptoms disappear . To increase rate of gain and improve feed efficiency , feed 10 to 20 grams per ton . As an aid in the prevention of bacterial diarrhea ( scours ) , feed 50 grams per ton .</context>

      <context> This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 ) . Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 a , b , c ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 ) . In the relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave_lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 cm . The observable characteristics of planetary radio_radiation are the intensity , the polarization , and the direction of <head>arrival</head> of the waves . The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute_of_arc . This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction , and consequently the radio_emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved . It should be possible , however , to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio_sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers .</context>

      <context> Occasionally , you may come_across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning_over sods in your garden , but you have_to be a really keen observer to see them at_all . They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in_spite_of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . I must add at_once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the <head>arrival</head> of the cold_weather . Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50 ` F and there is not too_much wind . Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a_couple_of those wonderful flowering currants such_as the red Ribes_sanguineum of our Pacific_Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy_willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins .</context>

      <context> El_Dorado was surrounded by a mob . They overflowed the parking_lot , making progress by automobile difficult . Long before he reached the protection of the stage_door , Andy was recognized . Word of his <head>arrival</head> spread through the crowd like a brush-fire . They surged around him , fingers pointing , eyes prying . It was not a hostile gathering but Andy sensed the difference from last night 's hero-worshippers . They had come not to admire but to observe .</context>

      <context> They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves , that of their own sweat , of campfire smoke , of horses and cattle .
