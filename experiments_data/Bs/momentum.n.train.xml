      <context> With detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a_few counts , the second and third Russian space_probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less_than that of larger ones . Being based on so few events , these results are of dubious validity . The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in_terms_of the particle parameters is very uncertain . Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident <head>momentum</head> of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities . However , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship . In the United_States , most_of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces . The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor .</context>

However , the conversion from mass to size is unreliable , since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as * * f . To_what_extent such low_density applies to micrometeorites is unknown .</context>

      <context> Of_course , if there is a dust blanket around the Earth , the fluxes in interplanetary_space should be less_than the figures given here . Note that the mass scale is one to two orders_of_magnitude greater than some previously used ; for_example , Jacchia ( 1948 ) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a * * f , zero magnitude meteorite . The older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic_energy into light . The mass scale used in Table 5 - 1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related_to the <head>momentum</head> transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 ) . A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 ) . Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites . The approximate equation is * * f , where n is the number of * * f with electron line density greater than or equal to * * f , and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite .</context>

      <context> These societies can expect to face difficult times . As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain <head>momentum</head> , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense_of_direction . National_leaders will have_to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men 's sense of identity . Feelings of a community of interest will have_to be recreated - in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for_the_first_time - on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past . Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing_through this stage can be escaped .</context>

      <context> I called the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves_Moreland , the Anglo-American literary critic - his mother was_born in Ohio - who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson_Downs , raising_hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old_man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such_as human stature , hope , and humor . My unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in_terms_of speed , <head>momentum</head> , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe_in the cult_of_personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . A bee 's place is in the hive '' . `` I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and_then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand .</context>
