      <context> Some members of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives . Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo_bumblebee '' as it is called in some European_countries . Female individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize . The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind_legs which in the case of the idler , Psithyrus , lack the pollen <head>baskets</head> - naturally ! The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host . When she succeeds , she usually manages to slip_in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment . The hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally .</context>

      <context> After_all , social life in the group of the bees is by_no_means general , although it certainly is a striking feature . On the basis of its life_history , we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees . The way in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect , either . It lacks pollen <head>baskets</head> and possesses only a large_number of long , branched hairs on its legs , on which the pollen grains will collect . Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks_like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind . Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali_bees . Nomia_melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United_States west of the Great_Plains , for_example , in Utah and central Washington .</context>

      <context> `` Slice o_' mutton '' ? Her name was Mollie . They called her Mollie_the_Mutton , and laughed . Looking down the street after her , Adam saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand from the <head>basket</head> . He could not make_out , but he knew that again she was scratching her nose . Mollie_the_Mutton was scratching her nose . The words ran crazily in his head : Mollie_the_Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain .</context>

      <context> The rice was n't dosed with opium , indeed it had no taste at_all , not a grain of salt . She ate what she could and went_out along the covered passageway , with the rain dripping from the vines . In the kitchen Glendora was despairingly picking chickens . `` Get a <head>basket</head> '' , Sarah told her . `` We 'll go_to the storehouse '' . Glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers , and went with her through the drizzle , to the storehouse . Sarah found the right key and unlocked the door .</context>
