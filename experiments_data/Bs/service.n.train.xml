      <context> In such a world the words `` matter '' and `` spirit '' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all . In it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in_general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously . The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit_world of the entities which previously populated it . In carrying_out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable <head>service</head> for which it can claim due credit . The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support . Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time . When , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality .</context>

      <context> A Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going_in and out of the Birmingham_Oratory ( Catholic ) Church on Sunday mornings . She found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per_cent of English_people are churchgoers . She may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less_than ten . From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all_but empty during <head>services</head> . A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city_university , following Anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated Mass before more_than a_hundred .

A fourteen year old girl from the Middle_West observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities - at_least with the peripheral activities that many middle_class Jews now regard_as religious . It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish <head>service</head> groups because she would not travel on Saturday and , in_addition , required kosher food . Another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only Orthodox girl in town '' .

      <context> Finally , in The Maltese_Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam_Spade becomes the chief murder_suspect . In_order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl_friend . What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock_Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private_eye is in danger of turning_into his opposite . It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public <head>service</head> in the mystery_story which creates this fatal dilemma . By upholding his own personal code_of_behavior , the private_detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption . That society responds by condemning the private_eye as a threat to the status_quo , a potential criminal . If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society .</context>

      <context> He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at_all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished . Thus the fictional detective is much more_than a simple businessman . He is , first_and_foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society . It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public <head>service</head> which accounts_for the great appeal of the mythological detective . By_virtue_of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private_eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle_class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let_the_devil_take_the_hindmost . At_the_same_time , because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle_class eyes a virtuous man . In this way , the private_detective gets the best of two possible worlds .</context>

      <context> Driven from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguises himself as a private_detective . The birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal . Even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which give_rise to the mystery_story are not fully resolved . The individualism and public <head>service</head> of the private_detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code_of_conduct : he enforces the law without being told to do so . The private_eye is therefore a moral man ; but his morality rests upon that of his society . The basic premise of all mystery_stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal . Unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good .</context>

On March 21 , 1957 , however , the Department recommended approval of the 1_,_-_A classification . Its ground for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date ) , that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the Jehovah's_Witnesses reported that he was no_longer doing so and , on_the_contrary , had relinquished both his Pioneer_and_Bible_Student_Servant positions . It reported that he now devoted only some 6 - 1_2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities .</context>

      <context> Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted . Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social_system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective . In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of <head>services</head> for them - and that with independence free_men do not have_to work to realize the benefits of modern life . For_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement . The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies .</context>

      <context> The belief in immortality , where held , functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here_and_now . The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance . The feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as_well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving_vent to emotions and energies . In providing for these inner individual functions , religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace_of_mind and well-being <head>services</head> for which there is no other institution . In_addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society . The two have never been separable .

      <context> The first mention of an electric plant in Manchester seems to be one installed in Reuben_Colvin 's and Houghton 's gristmill on the West_Branch in Factory_Point . No records are available as_to the date or extent of installation , but it may have been in 1896 .

In November 1900 surveying was done under John_Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power_plant .

      <context> New , indeed , is Luther 's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at . Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in_theory or in_practice . Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; even houses changed once a decade ; six hours of manual_labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; no private_property , no money ; no sort of pricing at_all for any goods or <head>services</head> , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term . Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist . It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that informs those details . What that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history , the one which reached Christianity by_the_way_of Stoicism through the Church_Fathers of Late Antiquity .</context>
