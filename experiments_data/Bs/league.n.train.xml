      <context> When he was inducted into the Army at Fort_Knox_, Ky. , Hansen 's weight had dropped to 180 - `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said . `` I feel good physically '' , Hansen added , `` but I think I 'll move better carrying a_little less weight than I'm carrying now '' . The rangy , Albany ( Cal. ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as_well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding '' as his 1961 goal . `` I think I can do a better job with the glove , now that I know the hitters around the <head>league</head> a_little better '' , he said . Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami_Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two game weekend series with the New_York Yankees . Skinny_Brown and Hoyt_Wilhelm , the Flock 's veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the American_League champions in tomorrow 's 8 P.M. contest . Ryne_Duren and Roland_Sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15 - 1 record last year for the Yanks ' Auburn ( N.Y. ) farm_club of the Class - D New_York-Pennsylvania_League , are the probable rival pitchers .</context>

      <context> The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American_Football_League starts - a 19 - 12 triumph over the Denver_Broncos - but their visit will be a short one . The Texans have two more road_games - at Buffalo and Houston - before they play for the home_folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank_Stram 's men will meet the Bills just_as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings . Buffalo coach Buster_Ramsey , who has become one of the game 's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex National_Football_Leaguers , M._C._Reynolds and Warren_Rabb . Rabb , the former Louisiana_State field_general , came_off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22 - 12 upset victory over the Houston_Oilers , defending <head>league</head> champions . `` Just our luck '' ! exclaimed Stram . `` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just_as we head that way '' . Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned_in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack_Spikes , though he did the team 's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury .</context>

      <context> But after that 12 at Los_Angeles he became one_of_the_boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis_Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National_Football_League owners at a meeting at the Hotel_Warwick today . Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football 's hall_of_fame , players ' benefits and constitutional amendments . The owners would_like each club in the fourteen team <head>league</head> to play a home and home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division . However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks . Pete_Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed_out : `` We 'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' .</context>

      <context> Inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph_Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey . The Major decided that , rather_than be led , the slugger could lead . And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so_far . The opinion continues here that with a 162 - game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10 - team <head>league</head> and a most inviting target in Los_Angeles ' Wrigley_Field_Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe_Ruth 's 60 homers of 1927 . Mays ' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year . Willie 's wonderful walloping Sunday - four home_runs - served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin_Dark . Next to Leo_Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass green rookie rushed up_to the Polo_Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant .</context>

      <context> Other pilot_programs were conducted by A_+_S , Babylon , New_York ; J._L._Hudson , Detroit ; Joseph_Horne , Pittsburgh . Other THC activities followed , conducted by shopping_centers , department_stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio - TV stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related_to hunting and wise use of our natural_resources . SAAMI 's field men have served as consultants and / or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40000 enthusiastic young Americans . Through the efforts of SAAMI 's shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet <head>leagues</head> , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a_few . The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many_of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it . Help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level .</context>

      <context> This further demonstration of O_'_Banion 's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone . In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self_aggrandisement for their liking . He behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness . They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado - as , when his bodyguard , Yankee_Schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by Dave_Miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were Hirschey , a gambler politician in loose beer running <head>league</head> with Torrio and O_'_Banion , Frank , a policeman , and Max , the youngest . To settle this slight , O_'_Banion went down to the La_Salle_Theatre in the Loop , where , he had learned , Dave_Miller was attending the opening of a musical_comedy . At the end of the performance , Dave and Max came_out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first_nighters . O_'_Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave , severely wounding him in the stomach .</context>
