      <context> These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism . This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in_practice , antithetical to these conditions ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization . Moreover , as Communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro_rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote . It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant , proximate <head>goal</head> of American policy . Proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive '' ends we seek , to which victory over Communism is but a means .

Indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific . In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliament - the elected representatives - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary . When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit - when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands - two purposes were served : Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law became a rational system for implementing that will , for serving conscious <head>goals</head> , for embodying the `` public policy '' . It is true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , inhibited the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy .

      <context> He must mentally pull the blinds and close the window , so that all that existed was in the books before him . At law_school , the same . More of this stamping_down of human emotion as a young lawyer in New_York . By the time he was prosperous enough - his <head>goals</head> were high - he was bald and afraid of women . The only one who would have him was his cripple , the strange unhappy woman who became his wife . Perhaps it was right ; perhaps it was just . He had dared to defy nature , to turn his back to the Lorelei , and he was punished .</context>

      <context> `` I do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism . We are here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest , seeking human dignity . Beyond the forest all our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren , eroded hills of Judea . This is our singular <head>goal</head> . How we travel through the forest is for each man 's conscience . Where we end our journey is always the same . We all seek the same thing through different ways - an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star_of_David flies over Zion '' .</context>

      <context> She was the sun , he the closest planet orbiting around her , the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed . For fifty-five years he had lived , progressing towards a no-goal , eating , working , breathing without plan , without reason . Kitti had come_along to justify everything . She was his <head>goal</head> , she was his reason . He had lived all his life waiting for her . Not once , in the time that he had known her , had he ever considered the possibility , not once , not for one one-thousandth of a second , of her infidelity .

      <context> It was n't just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse I often used , even to myself . It was the kind of work I was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting . I kept saying , `` If I could just build_up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get_to be well_known as an illustrator - like Peter_Askington , for_instance - then I could take some time_off and paint '' . Askington was a kind of <head>goal</head> I set myself ; I had admired him long before I talked to him . It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income . The night we first met , at one of Mrs._Monmouth 's giant parties , he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt ; instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade . This set his tone : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as_well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off 's rent for a year .</context>
