      <context> The Orioles tonight retained the <head>distinction</head> of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League_clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas_City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . Indications as_late_as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory drought as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage . Over the first five frames , Jack_Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in_the_middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American_League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick_Hyde , submarine_ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock .</context>

      <context> As a result , although we still make use of this <head>distinction</head> , there is much confusion as_to the meaning of the basic terms employed . Just what is meant by `` spirit '' and by `` matter '' ? The terms are generally taken_for_granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all . Yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must_not do .</context>

      <context> The biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words : `` So God created man in his own image ; in the similitude of God he created him '' . There are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement : `` If the [ Holy ] Spirit is absent from the soul , such a man is indeed of an animal nature ; and , being left carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possessing the image [ of God ] in his formation , but not receiving the similitude [ of God ] through the Spirit '' . Thus the image of God is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster ; the similitude of God , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature . Recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this <head>distinction</head> . He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as_well_as of mortality . Therefore Irenaeus describes man 's creation as_follows : `` So_that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted_up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take_up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all .</context>

      <context> `` So_that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted_up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take_up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all . And He laid_down for him certain conditions : so_that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' . These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result . There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological <head>distinction</head> between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) . Man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil 's promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality . He was , in the words of Irenaeus , `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality '' . The true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this .</context>

      <context> Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation . The music is always allowed the living_space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi performer . The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance . All_of this would be wasted , of_course , if the performance lacked authority and musical <head>distinction</head> . For me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors . Steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms set_down on_paper . Those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one .</context>

      <context> Artur_Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable . But Schnabel was a great teacher in_addition_to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford_Curzon , Frank_Glazer , Adrian_Aeschbacher , and Victor_Babin ) also sheds_light_on the master 's pedagogical skills . Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in_that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) . But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel 's <head>distinction</head> as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student 's approach as distinctly his own . Schnabel 's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one . Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .</context>

      <context> Catholics , Protestants and Jews are in_agreement over the objectives of family_planning , but disagree over the methods to be used . The Roman_Catholic_Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm_method , also_known_as the use of the infertile or safe period . The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature 's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them . With the exception of the Roman_Catholic and the Orthodox_Catholic_Churches , most churches make no moral <head>distinction</head> between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice . Here is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement . The grounds for the Church 's position are Scriptural ( Old_Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural_law . The latter plays a prominent role in Roman_Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods .</context>

      <context> In_the_first_place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale . Robert_Frost , for_instance , writes about rural life in New_England , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems . This has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk_poet '' , simply because he is a rural one . In the second place , a large_number of writers , making a more direct claim than Frost to being `` folk_writers '' of one sort or another , clearly make no <head>distinctions</head> between genuine and bogus material . Stephen_Vincent_Benet 's John_Brown's_Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John_Steinbeck 's The_Grapes_of_Wrath and Carl_Sandburg 's The_People,_Yes . The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass . Folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it .</context>

      <context> There is no_more `` plot '' than that ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give . The artistic interest , then , lies_in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness . The first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent : `` The way to the churchyard ran_along beside the highroad , ran beside it all_the_way to the end ; that_is_to_say , to the churchyard '' . And the action is consistently presented with regard for this <head>distinction</head> . The highroad , one might say at_first , belongs_to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs_to death . But that is too simple , and won't hold_up . As the first sentence suggests , both roads belong_to death in_the_end .</context>

      <context> This understanding , of_course , may in_its_turn take many forms and some of these - especially those most interesting to the student of comparative_literature - are essentially historical . But the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic questions of form , `` texture '' , or technique . He may also consider ideas . It is true that this <head>distinction</head> between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in_the_end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight . But , in_general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other . At this point a working definition of idea is in_order , although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed . The term idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as_opposed_to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience .</context>

      <context> Observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion . This behavior is more `` veridical '' - or true than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning . While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure . The objective of this chapter is to clarify the <head>distinctions</head> between spontaneity theory and other training concepts . In_addition , the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed . The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area . The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold :</context>

      <context> I can n't be happy long without drinking water '' . In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent_to on Tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken_language ; but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a prepositional unit used as an adjunct , by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at_most . In the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking_water is equivalent_to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water . But the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for_example , can undermine <head>distinctions</head> such_as these . And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by_any_means . In the Steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them , and in I looked_up the number and I looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second . - Syllables are linguistic_units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but , as has been noted , are consonantal under certain circumstances , and which may or may not be combined with preceding and / or following consonants or combinations of consonants .</context>

      <context> The first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses . Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant_systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal_systems , including some of the more unusual types . By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no_more of the range of possibilities in tone_systems than the over-simple <head>distinction</head> between register and contour_languages . This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone .

      <context> Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance . As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion . A._E._Sharp , in Vowel-Length_and_Syllabicity_in_Kikuyu , examines one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in_detail . His objective is merely to determine `` what <head>distinctions</head> of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography '' ( 59 ) . To do so , he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in_detail . In the process , he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult . A_few of his examples are of very great interest , and the whole discussion of some importance for theory .</context>

      <context> But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; and Gleason presumably is on_the_way with a further contribution in this area . As to relative_frequencies of competing roots ( 7 - 1 vs. 4 - 4 , etc_. ) , Thomas with his ' weighting ' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have . The problem needs further exploration . I was at_least conscious of the <head>distinction</head> in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication , in which , in listing ' Two_Stem_Meanings ' , I set_off by asterisks those forms in which n of stem B was * * f of stem A_3 , the unasterisked ones standing_for * * f ; or under ' Four_Stems ' , I set_off by asterisks cases where the combined n of stems * * f was * * f . These findings , and_others which will in_time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry . If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per_cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per_cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller .</context>
