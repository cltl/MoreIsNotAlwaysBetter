      <context> Principals of the 13 schools in the Denton_Independent_School_District have been re-elected for the 1961 - 62 session upon the recommendation of Supt._Chester_O._Strickland . State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called_for yesterday in a report of a `` blue_ribbon '' citizens_committee on the aid to dependent children program . The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New_York_City welfare consulting_firm , listed 10 long_range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case_load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of <head>family</head> breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C._Virgil_Martin , president of Carson_Pirie_Scott_+_Co. , committee chairman . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend_upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color .</context>

      <context> Nearly 18 per_cent of West_Berlin 's 2200000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12.8 per_cent are under fifteen . R._H._S._Crossman , M.P. , writing in The_Manchester_Guardian , states that departures from West_Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a week . The official statistics show that 60 per_cent are employed workers or independent professional people . Whole <head>families</head> are moving and removal_firms are booked for months ahead . The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each_week from West_Germany , but the hard truth , says Crossman , is that `` The closing_off of East_Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East_German , as distinct from Russian , troops was a major Communist victory , which dealt West_Berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow . The gallant half city is dying on_its_feet '' . Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in the Observer ( London ) .</context>

      <context> Oersted 's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life . He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of Langeland in the south_central part of Denmark on August 14 , 1777 . His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his <head>family</head> , let_alone educate them in a town without even a school . The two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish . Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum . Oldenburg 's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn_to a wider circle of the town 's learned , such_as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching .</context>

With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now . There were umbrella_tents , wall_tents , cottage_tents , station_wagon tents , pup_tents , Pop_tents , Baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper_trailers , travel_trailers , and even a_few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire <head>family</head> camps .

Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture . If you are not well acquainted_with the area in which you wish_to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your <head>family</head> will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy . Discussed below are some of the main things to look_for when you select a part-time farm . Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities . Then if you change jobs you won n't necessarily have_to sell the farm .</context>

      <context> The total is the probable gross income from farming . To find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming . Include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm_buildings and equipment . Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the <head>family</head> . It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it . Otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor . To figure the value of the farm in_terms_of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way .</context>

      <context> The savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed . Usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more . Where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real_estate taxes are usually about the same . A part-time farmer and his <head>family</head> can use their spare_time profitably . Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational . For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner . Part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment - or a great_deal .</context>

      <context> You could not , of_course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small . If you want_to raise feed or carry_out some enterprise on a larger scale , you 'll need more land .

But consider also how much you and your <head>family</head> can keep_up along with your other work . The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision . Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development . This is a highly speculative venture .</context>

      <context> In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth_control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere . Many other Protestant_denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action . In March , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the Federal_Council_of_Churches ratified artificial methods of birth_control . `` As_to the necessity '' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the <head>family</head> and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question . There is general_agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual_affection without relation_to procreation is right '' . Since then , many Protestant_denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not_only approved birth_control , but declared it at_times to be a religious duty . What determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive .</context>

      <context> A year later in Albany , N._Y. , a Roman_Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned_Parenthood_Association . Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious_belief and conscience . These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue . It has flared_up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and <head>family</head> welfare agencies . It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries .

      <context> There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and <head>families</head> of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . ) In a mobile society , congregational health depends_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like elements will have_to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .</context>

      <context> The fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern , I rather think , for the South has been no_more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity . Some of us might be inclined to argue , in_fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly Southern traits . There is no necessity , I suppose , to assert that Mr._Faulkner is Southern . It would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his <head>family</head> . And , after_all , he has lived comfortably at both Oxford , Mississippi , and Charlottesville , Virginia . The young William_Faulkner in New_Orleans in the 1920 's impressed the novelist Hamilton_Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so . Besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in_addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years .</context>

      <context> We shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x successes for given values of p and n . When each number of successes x is paired with its probability of occurrence * * f , the set of pairs * * f , is a probability function called a binomial_distribution . The choice of p and n determines the binomial_distribution uniquely , and different choices always produce different distributions ( except when * * f ; then the number of successes is always 0 ) . The set of all binomial_distributions is called the <head>family</head> of binomial_distributions , but in general discussions this expression is often shortened to `` the binomial_distribution '' , or even `` the binomial '' when the context is clear . Binomial_distributions were treated by James_Bernoulli about 1700 , and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called Bernoulli trials . Each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success . Therefore each binomial trial can be thought_of as producing a value of a random_variable associated with that trial and taking the values 0 and 1 , with probabilities q and p respectively .</context>

      <context> These are real analytic periodic functions with period T . In the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares . This theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in **f . The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in **f there are <head>families</head> of such cubes . Here , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results . A square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may_not lie entirely in the interior of C . Indeed , the spiral **f , with the two endpoints connected by a straight_line possesses only one inscribed square .</context>

      <context> Thomas ' findings are , first , `` that the individual items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence '' ; but , second , `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence '' ( as between M-K and I-E . His first conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on Ath. and Yok . ) was partially positive . His second conclusion , on semantic word_classes , agrees with mine . This second conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language <head>families</head> as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored . Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence , which weights not_only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative_frequency . Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is : stem identical in 8 languages , 100 % ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86 % ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , 64 % ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57 % . His formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material .</context>

      <context> This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very_much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; or both . The differentiation however is not very_much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . ( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem / item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . ) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two <head>families</head> is similar enough to warrant comparison . The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is_due to differences in the two sets of lists used . These differences in_turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built_up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer 's vocabulary is based_on Swadesh 's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined .

      <context> To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative_officials and judges - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with . Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society . Indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society . Government itself was based upon contract ; business_organization - the corporation - was analyzed in contractual terms ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; even marriage and the <head>family</head> was seen as a contractual arrangement . It is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in_terms_of contract .

      <context> My camp made leather wallet , bulky with twisted , raised stitches around the edges , I stuffed with money I had been saving . Hatless , in an overcoat of rough blue wool , I was given a proud farewell by my mother and father , and I set_out into the strangely still streets of Brooklyn . I felt superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving_behind , felt older than my years , and was full of compliments for myself as I headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of_that dull borough and into the unstable , tantalizing excitement of Manhattan . Times_Square , when I ascended to_it with my fellow subway travellers ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a <head>family</head> of which we were all distant members ) , was nearly impassable , the sidewalks swarming_with celebrants , with bundled_up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey . Heavy_coated , severe looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling_out in_front of the crawling traffic . The night was cold but the crowd kept one warm . The giant electric signs and marquees were lit_up for_the_first_time since blackout regulations had been instituted , and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around_the_corner .</context>

Casey made some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man . His name was George_Needham and he , too , had come from a good <head>family</head> . He was perhaps thirty-two , nicely set_up , with light_brown hair that had a pronounced wave . He was always well groomed and well tailored , and he had that rich_man 's look which was authentic enough and came from two good prep_schools and a proper university . An only child , he had done all the things that young_men do who have been born to money and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke .</context>

      <context> Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son_of_a_bitch '' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer_bottle into Johnson 's quivering ribs . A big car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning . Beyond it the gray road stretched a long , long way . The car was just about to us , its driver 's fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on business , on a <head>family</head> in Sante_Fe - on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human_beings desperately needed rescue . I tossed the bottle . High , so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car 's steel roof . Too high .</context>

      <context> You have unwittingly set_in_motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . Quite candidly , fellows , I would n't be_in_your_shoes for all the rice in China . As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly . Sometime on Saturday evening , August 22nd , while my <head>family</head> and I were dining at the Hostaria_dell_'Orso , in Rome , you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks_County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . Hastening to the attic , the temperature of_which was easily hotter than the Gold_Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the_like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there . What you were looking_for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis_rackets and fly screens ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph_records scattered about a fumed_oak Victrola , you danced two tangos and a paso_doble , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu . You then descended one story , glommed a television_set from the music room - the only constructive feature of your visit , by_the_way - and , returning to the ground_floor , entered the master_bedroom .</context>
