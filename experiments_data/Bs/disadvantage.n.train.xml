      <context> As a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in `` swallowing '' creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) . As to benefits to employees , it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends_on them for services . The corporation in America is in_reality our form of socialism , vying in_a_sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy . But while the corporation has all the <head>disadvantages</head> of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status_quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as_a_whole . So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard_to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation 's needs for survival . The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society . Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society .</context>

      <context> My heartiest congratulations go to their successors , Orvil_E._Dryfoos and John_B._Oakes , who can be counted_upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New_York_Times . The people of the 17_th District of New_York , and I as their Representative in Congress , take great pride in the New_York_Times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world . Mr._Speaker , in my latest newsletter to my constituents I urged the imposition of a naval_blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from coming into the Western_Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe_Doctrine . Yesterday , I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U._S._News_+_World_Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its <head>disadvantages</head> . Under leave to extend my remarks , I include the relevant portion of my newsletter , together with the text of the article from the U._S._News_+_World_Report : `` Cuban S._S._R. : Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro held mainland last week , there was at_least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian dominated military base .</context>

      <context> Sarason et_al. present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test like situation , and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher . Although the present study was not a direct replication of their investigations , the results do not confirm their conclusion . Observers , in the two school_systems studied here , judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and demanding , while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting . Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous <head>disadvantage</head> only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting .</context>
