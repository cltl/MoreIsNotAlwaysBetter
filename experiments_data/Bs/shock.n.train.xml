      <context> Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final_Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? Should not everyone have been awakened to_it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard_to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the <head>shock</head> of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by_no_means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) . Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin . It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe . It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; most_of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War_Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors ' accounts .</context>

      <context> All_of these activities are geared to a top priority communication_system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly . Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence . On November 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka_Peninsula . At 17_:_07 that afternoon ( Greenwich_time ) the <head>shock</head> was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu . The warning system immediately went into action . Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake 's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude . While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came_in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military_services and the police that the first big wave would arrive_at Honolulu at 23_:_30 Greenwich_time .</context>

      <context> A high protein diet , calcium_lactate supplements , and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness . The terminal hospital admission on June 27 , 1959 , was necessitated by continued weakness and debility complicated by urinary retention and painful thrombosed hemorrhoids . X-ray_films of the vertebral_column showed progression of the demineralization . On July 4 , 1959 , the patient developed marked abdominal pain and distension , went into <head>shock</head> , and died . The body was that of a well developed , somewhat debilitated white_man weighing 108 lb. There were bilateral pterygia and arcus_senilis , and the mouth was edentulous . The heart weighed 510 gm. , and at the outflow tracts the left and right_ventricles measured 19 and 3 mm. , respectively . The coronary_arteries were sclerotic and diffusely narrowed throughout their courses , and the right_coronary_artery was virtually occluded by a yellow atheromatous plaque 1.5 cm. distal to its origin .</context>

      <context> In a conditioning experiment , he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain . A mild electrical_shock served as a conditioned_stimulus and was followed by feeding . The pain became thus the symbol for food and elicited salivary secretion ( conditioned_reflex ) . Even when the intensity of the <head>shocks</head> was increased gradually , it failed to evoke any signs of pain . Since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation , Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding . Appropriate experiments showed that this is , indeed , possible . He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses .</context>

      <context> Joel went_to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate . When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful . They all prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come , for Virginia had defended her land victoriously . The week after Manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in <head>shock</head> from an afternoon 's rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window . They had already lost most_of their corn , she thought . Were they to be insulted again because of the South 's great victory ?

      <context> She thrust the envelope back in the bag ; there was no point in locking it up in the armoire now , it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen .

She went downstairs and received another curious <head>shock</head> , for when Glendora flapped into the dining_room in her homemade moccasins , Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she had n't . `` Too much work this morning , Miss_Sarah - everybody gone like that '' - Sarah swallowed past another kind of constriction in her throat . `` Well , then who brought it '' ?</context>
