      <context> For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned . One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had_to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas_chambers . The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten - the gas_chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star_of_David - nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . Public_relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying <head>interviews</head> with men and women on the street , cried_out : Too_much , too_much - the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had_to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most_of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing_on the corpus_delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject_to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs . Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection .</context>

      <context> My <head>interviews</head> with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds . Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings . `` Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive '' , a boy remarked . `` It means that you have_to get_ahead '' .</context>

      <context> Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ? I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing : in_the_last_analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself . Nevertheless I was curious . My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the <head>interview</head> by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a Jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near Paris . When Beckett 's name came into the discussion , the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett `` hates life '' . That , I thought , is at_least one thing I can find_out when we meet . Beckett 's appearance is rough-hewn Irish .</context>

      <context> Eight classrooms in three structured schools furnished 72 cases , 36 boys and 36 girls . Administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools . It was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with_respect_to the personality variables under investigation . An <head>interview</head> schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepared , and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home . The parent was asked to describe the child 's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self and others , irrational conformity to rules , orderliness , punctuality , and need for certainty . The interviewers were instructed not to suggest answers and , as_much_as_possible , to record the parents ' actual words as they described the child 's behavior in home situations . The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the interview records , categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity , then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records .</context>

The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the <head>interview</head> records , categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity , then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records . Final ratings were made on the basis of a point_system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that was deviant from the discovered norms . Children scoring high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations , or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals . The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters .</context>

      <context> She wrote again and now , abandoning for_the_moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career . She could act and she could write . His lordship was concerned in the management of Drury_Lane but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and criticize her novel ? At_last he consented to meet her , and following that brief <head>interview</head> Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal : Have you any objection to the following plan ? On Thursday evening we may go_out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles . There we shall be free and unknown ; we can return the following morning .</context>

She concluded by asking for a brief <head>interview</head> - `` to settle with you where '' - and she threw_in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild originality of your countenance '' . She opened his reply with trembling fingers . He agreed ! And he would see her that evening .</context>

      <context> A newspaper open at stock-market reports lay on one of them . Thayer folded it up and offered a drink . The inspector declined . To begin the <head>interview</head> , he asked if Thayer , with more time to think it over , could add to what he had said the other day about Johnston . Thayer shook his head . `` It 's all I think_about , too . That and her death .</context>

      <context> After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe_in the cult_of_personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . A bee 's place is in the hive '' . `` I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and_then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand . `` I seem to remember '' , he said , `` that in an <head>interview</head> ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live . Did you go_to their funeral '' ? `` I was wrong '' , I admitted . `` Comedy did n't die , it just went crazy .</context>
