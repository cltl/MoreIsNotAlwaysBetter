      <context> As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action . Pelham pointed_out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . A veteran Jackson_County legislator will ask the Georgia_House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . Rep._Mac_Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal <head>support</head> for public education , provided_that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would_like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday .</context>

      <context> ( Several times recently I have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in_front_of their eyes . I'm glad to say there 's none of that distraction in this `` Fiorello !

Loew_'s_Theater presents `` Where_the_Boys_are '' , an MGM picture produced by Joe_Pasternak and directed by Henry_Levin from a screenplay by George_Wells .

      <context> The Presto ma_non_assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real Allegro_con_spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet . In_the_end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings . Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at_times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song . The engineering provides exactly the <head>support</head> needed for such a result . Too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment . The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration . Your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score .</context>

      <context> The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . SAAMI 's financial <head>support</head> since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach . In 1959 SAAMI 's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports .</context>

For the States which maintain two separate agencies - one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of persons other_than the blind - the Act specifies that their minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal_year 1954 . Funds allotted in_addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine . As is the case with the allotment provisions for <head>support</head> of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula . Prior to 1960 , in_order to provide matching for the minimum ( base ) allotment , State funds had to equal 1954 State funds .

Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry_out the provisions of the Act .

The following table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , appropriations , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching_funds for this part of the grant program .

The Act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State . It stipulates , in_addition , that all amounts remaining as_a_result_of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums . These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per_capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State .</context>

      <context> The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called_in and notices of further investigation appeared from_time_to_time . In January , 1958 , the Minister_of_the_Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied . In late 1957 the M.P. ( Mouvement_Populaire ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council_of_Government under Balafrej was formed without <head>support</head> from progressive elements in the party . The parties were on_the_whole unprepared for elections , while the people were still experiencing post independence let-down and suffering the after_effects of poor harvests in 1957 . Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue . They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held .</context>

      <context> Another problem is who will pay for the training . Local school districts are hard_pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training . Programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business_leaders demand it . Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local <head>support</head> for training unless a new industry is in_sight and requests it . State_governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational_schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities . Only the Federal_government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs . If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states .</context>

      <context> However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment . Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . This probably would require some <head>support</head> for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment_compensation or a Youth_Conservation_Corps . A maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from home . A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor . Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training .</context>

      <context> During the latter days of November to the day of Brown 's execution , it seems that most Rhode_Islanders did not concur in `` E._B. 's '' suggestion . On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown 's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions . A week later the Daily_Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John_Brown on the day of his execution . The editor of the Daily_Journal warned , `` that if such a demonstration be made , it will not find <head>support</head> or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak_for Providence '' . The Providence_Daily_Post 's editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be held in Providence . He further called_upon the people of Providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace . On December 2 , 1859 , John_Brown was hanged at Charles_Town , Virginia .</context>

He was a loud-voiced man , once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability . He was stern and overbearing with his flock , but obsequious and conciliatory with the whites , especially the rich who partly supported the church . The Deacon_Board , headed by a black_man named Carlson , had practically taken_over as the pastor grew old , and had_its_way with the <head>support</head> of the Amen_corner . The characteristic thing about this church was its Amen_corner and the weekly religious orgy . A knot of old worshippers , chiefly women , listened weekly to a sermon . It began invariably in low tones , almost conversational , and then gradually worked_up to high , shrill appeals to God and man .</context>

      <context> In_particular he sought the gentle , sweet-faced nuns , with head_coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads , remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper . Discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a study of the anatomy of folds . He improvised as he went_along , completing a life-size clay figure , then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber , to the consistency of thick mud . No fold could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the Madonna 's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive <head>support</head> to Christ 's body , to intensify her inner turmoil . When the cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made . `` So that 's sculpture '' , commented Argiento wryly , when he had sluiced down the floor for a week , `` making mud pies '' . Michelangelo grinned .</context>

      <context> Stowey_Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality . He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rose at half past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn_flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald_Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh_Gazette , then put_on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop . This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil_geologist . The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window_sill , vertical steel columns wired for <head>support</head> to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting_out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass_through a whole house , visible all_the_way up through wire gratings on each floor . His files , desk , drafting_board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos . Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , ten foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as_though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac . Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden_Cycly_Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller_skates which he occasionally used up_and_down front of his house .</context>
