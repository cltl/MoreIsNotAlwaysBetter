      <context> The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League_clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas_City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . <head>Indications</head> as_late_as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory drought as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage . Over the first five frames , Jack_Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in_the_middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American_League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick_Hyde , submarine_ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock . A two run homer by Norm_Siebern and a solo_blast by Bill_Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts .</context>

      <context> Schnabel 's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one . Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced . And although Schnabel 's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert 's dynamic markings and phrase <head>indications</head> . The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives . About the Pro_Arte 's contribution I am less happy . I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group .</context>

      <context> The twenty-five year old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet . There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is_due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs . Turning_to the more modern versions , Curzon 's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work . Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought_out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious <head>indication</head> that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout . Some of Curzon 's playing strikes me as finicky , however . Why , for_example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ? The assisting musicians from the Vienna_Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing .</context>

      <context> The Doppler_effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood_vessel . A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself . It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream . The latter measures the heat carried_away by the bloodstream as an <head>indication</head> of the velocity of the blood flow . It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart 's left_ventricle , to indicate the blood_pressure in the heart itself . This pressure measurement may be made at_the_same_time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made . A simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in Fig. 2 .</context>

      <context> In this novel arrangement the `` pill '' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in_which the capacitor is formed by a pressure sensing transducer . As shown in Fig. 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400 - kc. bursts . The energy received by the `` pill '' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ringing '' takes_place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' . These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure <head>indications</head> can be obtained . One of the advantages of_this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions . Applications to organs other_than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments . One of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human_body .</context>

      <context> Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge . Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yr. ? Based on our experience with clients , we see 14 major problems which fall_into three broad groups - the market_place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management . There has been an intensification of price consciousness in recent years ; there is every <head>indication</head> it will continue . Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers . Despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before - traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer . Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target :</context>

      <context> The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family_planning . Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed . Family_planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring . Pope_Pius_12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long_time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such_as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` <head>indications</head> '' . This means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring . These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics in family_planning . The laws of many states permit birth_control only for medical reasons .</context>

      <context> For_example , the inflected forms of a word can be represented , insofar as regular inflection allows , by a stem and a set of endings to be attached . ( Indeed , the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings . ) The full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text form list . Similarly , if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary , the equivalents need be entered only once with an <head>indication</head> that they apply to each form . The dictionary system is in_no_way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it . When irregularity and variation prevent summarizing , information is written in complete detail . Entries are summarized only_when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased .</context>

      <context> The King decided to remove Ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a non-party Council_of_Government under his personal direction . Although the monarch had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance , his action was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor . The new Council was itself inescapably of political meaning , which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U.N.F.P. members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders . Since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections , and may have been more important as an <head>indication</head> of royal displeasure with the U.N.F.P. Voting preparations began in the fall of 1959 , although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes was completed in 1958 . There were three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of voters and the registration of candidates . Voter registration began in late November 1959 and continued until early January , 1960 .</context>

      <context> By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done . But here again , the surface declaring device both overshoots and falls_short_of its aim . For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives_way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief , which gives_way in_turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seems to contain both - or neither . Because of the size of the areas it covers , the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily , as more than an <head>indication</head> or sign . Literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerangs : the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before . Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it , the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as_well_as start his picture . The actual surface becomes both ground and background , and it turns_out - suddenly and paradoxically - that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in_front of , upon , the surface .</context>

For the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an <head>indication</head> of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it was probably the latter . Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in_order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village . At_the_same_time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out_of mere curiosity . No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived .</context>
