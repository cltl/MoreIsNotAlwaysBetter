      <context> An exhibition of Evelyn_Cibula 's paintings will open with a reception Nov. 5 at the Evanston_Community_center , 828 Davis_st. . It will continue all month . Abstractions and semi abstractions by Everett_McNear are being exhibited by the University_gallery_of_Notre_Dame until Nov. 5 . In the line of operatic trades to cushion the <head>budget</head> , the Dallas_Civic_Opera will use San_Francisco 's new Leni_Bauer-Ecsy production of `` Lucia_di_Lammermoor '' this season , returning the favor next season when San_Francisco uses the Dallas `` Don_Giovanni '' , designed by Franco_Zeffirelli . H._E._Bates has scribbled a farce called `` Hark_,_Hark_,_the_Lark '' ! It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season . If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find .</context>

      <context> Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense <head>budget</head> and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics . We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry . The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality . When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering .</context>

      <context> In 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at $ 18.9 billion , compared to $ 19.3 billion in 1960 . The decreases , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such_as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic_devices . Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 . New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this <head>budget</head> for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) totals $ 4753 million , which is $ 1390 million below that enacted for 1960 . On_the_other_hand , the new authority of $ 3825 million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is $ 581 million higher than for 1960 . These contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed_Forces in the years ahead . The Department_of_Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items .</context>

      <context> The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers , carrier based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles . The second capability is represented by our deployed ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement . The Strategic_Air_Command is the principal element of our long_range nuclear capability . One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this <head>budget</head> concerned the role of the B-70 , a long range supersonic bomber . This aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic_missile systems , all_of which are scheduled to become available earlier . The first Atlas ICBM 's are now operational , the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar_year , and the first Titan ICBM 's next year . The Minuteman solid fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about mid 1963 .</context>

      <context> By that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon_system . I am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 ( the B-52_H with the new turbofan_engine ) and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber , together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case . These additional modern bombers will replace some of the older B-47 medium bombers ; one B-52 can do the work of several B-47 's which it will replace . Funds are also included in this <head>budget</head> to continue the equipping of the B-52 wings with the Hound_Dog air-to-surface_missile . In the coming fiscal_year additional quantities of Atlas , Titan , and Polaris missiles also will be procured .</context>

      <context> Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year . Other factors increasing operating_costs include the higher unit_cost of each flying hour , up 11 % in two years , and of each steaming hour , up 15 % . In total , these increases in operating_costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such_as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed_Forces . In the <head>budget</head> message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 ) . This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying_out certain transactions involving real_property unless they come into agreement with the Committees_on_Armed_Services of the Senate and the House_of_Representatives . As I have stated previously , the Attorney_General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles . Accordingly , if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise .</context>

      <context> Strategy and tactics of the U._S. military_forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history . The change of emphasis from conventional type to missile type warfare must be made with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other . Our military_forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us , from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war . - This <head>budget</head> will provide in the fiscal_year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level - a year-end strength of 2489000 men and women in the active forces . The forces to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870000 men ; a Navy of 817 active ships and 619000 men ; a Marine_Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175000 men ; and an Air_Force of 91 combat wings and 825000 men . If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must conform_to the changing character and missions of the active forces . Quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers .</context>
