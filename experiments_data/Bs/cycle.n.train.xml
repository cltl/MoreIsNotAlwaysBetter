      <context> The Bayreuth_Festival opens July 23 with a new production of `` Tannhaeuser '' staged by Wieland_Wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by Wolfgang_Sawallisch . Sawalisch also conducts `` The_Flying_Dutch '' , opening July 24 . `` Parsifal '' follows July 25 , with Hans_Knappertsbusch conducting , and he also conducts `` Die_Meistersinger '' , to be presented Aug. 8 and 12 . The `` Ring '' <head>cycles</head> are July 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and Aug. 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 . Rudolf_Kempe conducts . No casts are listed , but Lotte_Lehmann sent_word that the Negro soprano , Grace_Bumbry , will sing Venus in `` Tannhaeuser '' . Remember how BY a series of booking absurdities Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi_Ballet ?</context>

      <context> Since American life is committed above_all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis . Consumer communities have suffered at_the_hands_of the productive interests . Negroes , Puerto_Ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities . Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding <head>cycle</head> which has characterized their history for a century . The identification of the basic unit of religious organization - the parish or congregation - with a residential area is self_defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron_trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation . Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle_classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion . This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches .</context>

      <context> To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition . But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating . The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave_rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize . It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly <head>cycle</head> did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter_solstice . This and other fears of the solar_system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic_system and its built-in concept of periodicity and_then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions . This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls . In_fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers .</context>

      <context> In a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic ; all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively . The young poet painter reproduces the French life of the streets ; he tells stories of the Thousand_and_One_Nights , and conjures_up before us the bazaars of Damascus . In the care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he loves it . And yet amid all the gay hedonism in Pilgrimage and Wander-Years is a <head>cycle</head> of short poems , '' Thoughts_in_Loneliness `` , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing '' . Of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as `` Nameless_and_Immortal '' , which at_once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language . It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum , next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence . On the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection .</context>

      <context> No attempts to measure the radio_emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small diameters , or low_temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave_lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity . In_spite of this , the very large radio_reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio_emission of most of the planets in a_few years . The study of the radio_emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25 - cm wave_length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 ) . This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25 - cm emission of the moon over three lunar <head>cycles</head> by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) . They deduced from their measurements that the radio_emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less_than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared_emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio_emission came about 3 - 1 2 days after Full_Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared_emission , which reaches its maximum at Full_Moon . Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing_out that rocklike materials which are likely to make_up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio_waves , although opaque to infrared_radiation . The infrared_emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due_to solar_radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase .</context>

      <context> Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water_cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account_for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug . The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator . The power source was a commercial D.C. rectifier . At 100 Amp the 360 <head>cycle</head> ripple was less_than 0.5 V ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load . The current was regulated by_means_of a variable_resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter . The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders . Because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast_resistor was required for stability of operation .</context>

      <context> Their appearance , next spring , coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants . In the Sacramento valley in California , for_instance , it has been observed that there was not one day 's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins . This must be_due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal . After the male and female andrenas have mated , the <head>cycle</head> is repeated . Although Andrena is gregarious , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together , we must still call it a solitary bee . Its life_history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life_cycle of many other species . After_all , social life in the group of the bees is by_no_means general , although it certainly is a striking feature .</context>

      <context> Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl_test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm . Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not_yet been tested on an adequate number of patients . The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable . It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep wakefulness <head>cycle</head> . A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting . In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such_as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs . The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated .</context>

      <context> Whosoever violates our rooftree , the legend states , can expect maximal sorrow . The teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles , his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers , and a trolley_car will grow in his stomach .

The <head>cycle</head> of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation . Sort_of remorseless , is n't it ? Still , there it is .
