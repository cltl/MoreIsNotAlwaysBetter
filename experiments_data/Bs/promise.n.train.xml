      <context> During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone_calls . Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election . Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election . Sheriff_Felix_Tabb said the ordinary apparently made_good his <head>promise</head> . `` Everything went real smooth '' , the sheriff said . `` There was n't a_bit of trouble '' .</context>

      <context> And He laid_down for him certain conditions : so_that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' . These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result . There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) . Man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil 's <head>promise</head> of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality . He was , in the words of Irenaeus , `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality '' . The true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this . `` Eve was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as_yet she was a virgin .</context>

      <context> It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges . One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous . But no : Prokofieff grew . He accepted the environment of his destiny - took_root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early <head>promise</head> . By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people : `` I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at_the_same_time I have by_no_means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody . This is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose - the clarity must be new , not old '' . How right he was ; how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism .</context>

      <context> The more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn . Camping is family fun , and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever saw before . But make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn_to camping is one of economy . Here is the <head>promise</head> of a vacation trip they can afford . The American_Automobile_Association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes_up with an average daily expenditure figure of $ 29 . The AAA then splits it down this way : $ 10.50 for meals , $ 9.50 for lodging , $ 7 for gas and oil , and $ 2 for tips and miscellaneous . What does the camping couple do to this set of figures ?</context>

      <context> The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems . Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually_exclusive , that they belong together . Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being . And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives <head>promise</head> that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written . For better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . A broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcends the non artistic causal_factors out of which it arises . On_the_other_hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs .</context>

      <context> Another great danger is that the emerging middle_class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political_leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism . The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West . Particularly when based upon a single dominant party , governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest . Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the <head>promises</head> of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead rigid and inflexible in their policies . American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes . It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies . We have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways .</context>

      <context> The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics . Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence . They were stressed in the speeches of Si_Mubarak_Bekkai when the first Council_of_Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council . King_Muhammad /5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm <head>promise</head> of elections on May_Day , 1957 . There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister_of_the_Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less_than enthusiastic . Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the_French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious . From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government .</context>

      <context> In November 1900 surveying was done under John_Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power_plant . Nothing came of it , perhaps due_to lack of opportunity for water storage . The next step was construction by the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company of a plant on the west bank of the Battenkill south of Union_Street bridge . This was nearly completed May 23 , 1901 with a <head>promise</head> of lights by June 10 , but the first light did not go_on until September 28 . It was at the end of the sidewalk in_front of the Dellwood_Cemetery cottage . The first directors of the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company were John_Marsden , M._L._Manley , William_F._Orvis , George_Smith , and John_Blackmer . The officers were John_Marsden , president ; John_C._Blackmer , vice-president ; George_Smith , treasurer ; and William_F._Orvis , secretary .</context>

      <context> Back_and_forth Duclos had_to go , between M._de_Cury and Jean_Jacques and between the Duke_d'Aumont and Jean_Jacques again , as his little operetta , The_Village_Soothsayer , though still unperformed , took_on ever more importance . And of_course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get_around among his closest friends . But they , naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at_large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles . How titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most glowing terms of the <head>promise</head> of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals . The furor was such_that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational . And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe , Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration , trembling lest his authorship become known , and at_the_same_time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer . He felt himself now , as he himself says in his Confessions , at a crucial point of his life .</context>

      <context> Nothing in_all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world . In final separation from them , in the railroad_terminal across the river from New_York , I would nearly cry . My parents ' welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted . But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave <head>promise</head> of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or mess-hall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond . These letters became the center of my existence . I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer . My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when '' ; and_others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commencing again her piano_lessons , her private_school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe .</context>

      <context> Sol_Phillips had purchased the Alliance_Furniture_Mart seventeen years ago .
