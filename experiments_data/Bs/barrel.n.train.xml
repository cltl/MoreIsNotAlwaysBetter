      <context> In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per_cent duty on imports via Hudson's_Bay which were viewed_as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' . To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company 's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain_from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . With their customary source of supply cut_off , the Fort_Garry free_traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country . Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St._Paul and goods from St._Paul to Red_River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty <head>barrels</head> of whisky to the British settlement . This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per_cent after February 1835 , but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per_cent on the initiative of the London committee . The trade in a_few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49 th parallel .</context>

      <context> O_'_Banion 's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal . Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O_'_Banion gang 's seizure from a West_Side marshalling_yard of a freight-car load of Canadian whisky worth $ 100000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition_era - the Sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation . Here was stored $ 1000000 worth of bonded whisky . These 1750 cases were carted_off in a one night operation by the O_'_Banion men , who left in their stead the same number of <head>barrels</head> filled with water .</context>

      <context> Could we be ready in 15_minutes ? His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go_out of town , and he was eager to be off . And so , after a flight southeast to Savannakhet , we found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince_Boun_Oum of Champassak , a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush_jacket and a ten-gallon_hat from Texas . From his shoulder_bag peeked the seven inch <head>barrel</head> of a Luger . The temperature rose to 105 ` . With our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust . In Keng_Kok , the City of Silkworms , the Prime_Minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me .</context>

      <context> Standing in the shelter of the tent - a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped , no_longer drumming - Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid across two beef <head>barrels</head> . There was , of_course , no real need to rearrange everything . A quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake , or the toffee , or the barley sugar , or the sardines , or the bitters , or the condensed_milk , or the stationery , or the needles - what could it mean ? Adam watched his own hands make the caressing , anxious movement that , when rain falls and nobody comes , and ruin draws_close like a cat rubbing against the ankles , has been the ritual of stall vendors , forever .</context>

      <context> He looked_out of the tent at the company street . The rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street . Beyond that misty gray of the rain , he saw the stretching hutment , low diminutive log_cabins , chinked with mud , with doorways a man would have_to crouch to get through , with roofs of tenting laid_over boughs or boards from hardtack boxes , or fence_rails , with cranky chimneys of sticks and dried mud . The chimney of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef <head>barrel</head> with ends knocked_out . In this heavy air , however , that device did not seem to help . The smoke from that chimney rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other , and hung as sadly in the drizzle , creeping back_down along the sopping canvas of the roof . Over the door was a board with large , inept lettering :</context>

      <context> The burning air dried his sweat soaked clothes in salt edged patches . He cleared his throat and wet his lips . As cheerfully as possible , he said , `` Well , I guess we could all do with a little drink '' . He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a <head>barrel</head> . They could no_longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat_bag that cooled it by evaporation . The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste . But it was water .</context>

      <context> Quite candidly , fellows , I would n't be_in_your_shoes for all the rice in China . As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly . Sometime on Saturday evening , August 22nd , while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria_dell_'Orso , in Rome , you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks_County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . Hastening to the attic , the temperature of_which was easily hotter than the Gold_Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the_like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and <head>barrels</head> stored there . What you were looking_for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis_rackets and fly screens ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph_records scattered about a fumed_oak Victrola , you danced two tangos and a paso_doble , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu . You then descended one story , glommed a television_set from the music room - the only constructive feature of your visit , by_the_way - and , returning to the ground_floor , entered the master_bedroom . From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade handled magnifying_glass .</context>
