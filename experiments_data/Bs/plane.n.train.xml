      <context> Whether the compromises - on both sides - that made_possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen . Mr._Khrushchev 's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ; the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U_Thant represents . In_a_sense , the showdown promised by Mr._Hammarskjold 's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; no precedents have been set as_yet ; structurally , the U.N. is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing_to_bear upon it . But at_least the pessimists who believed that the world_organization had plunged to its death in that <head>plane</head> crash in the Congo have been proved wrong . No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade . These are mentalities which crave action - and they are beginning to get_it , as Messrs._Salsich and Engh report on page 372 .

      <context> In analyzing the watercolors of Roy_Mason , the first thing that comes_to_mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate . Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential <head>planes</head> : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; a middle_distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .</context>

When I looked_up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 15_th , I realized that Roy was_born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist : the water sign of Pisces ( February 18 - March 20 ) . And how very often a water <head>plane</head> is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in American_Artist again , in his natal month of March ! Over the years , beginning in 1929 , Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals ; two Ranger_Fund_purchase_awards ; the Joseph_Pennell_Memorial_Medal ; two American_Watercolor_Society_prizes ; the Blair_Purchase_Prize for watercolor , Art_Institute of Chicago ; and_others in Buffalo , New_York , Chautauqua , New_Haven , Rochester , Rockport , and most_recently , the $ 300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna_Beach_Art_Association , He was elected to the National_Academy_of_Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger_Fund_Purchase_Prize at the Academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to Academicianship in 1940 .

      <context> Cuban S._S._R. : Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro held mainland last week , there was at_least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian dominated military base . In_fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment . Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought_home to all_of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home . Russian tanks and <head>planes</head> in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United_States , violate the Monroe_Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin_American republic . Once the full extent of_this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President_Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone . But the Latin_American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American_Defense_Board . For years the United_States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro 's representative from secret military talks .</context>

      <context> It is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , Members of Congress , officers in the Pentagon . As a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions . Among these questions : Military experts say a tight naval_blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task_forces , each built around an aircraft_carrier with a complement of about 100 <head>planes</head> and several destroyers . The Navy , on April 25 , announced it is bringing_back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean , increasing to four the number of attack_carriers in the vicinity of Cuba . More than 36 other big Navy ships are no less_than a day 's sailing time away . To round_out the blockading force , submarines would be needed - to locate , identify and track approaching vessels .</context>

      <context> To round_out the blockading force , submarines would be needed - to locate , identify and track approaching vessels . Land based radar would help with this task . So would radar picket_ships . A squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol <head>planes</head> would add support to the carrier task_forces . Three requirements go_with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; and it must be enforced without discrimination . Once these conditions of international_law are met , countries that try to run to blockade do so at their own risk . Blockade runners can be stopped - by gunfire , if necessary - searched and held , at_least temporarily .</context>

      <context> These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear . Just as the pressure exerted by surface_tension in a spherical drop is * * f and the pressure exerted by surface_tension on a cylindrical shape is * * f , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is * * f , where |g is the interfacial_tension and * * f and * * f are the two radii_of_curvature . This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason . If a is the major_axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes , the radius_of_curvature in the ab <head>plane</head> at the end of the axis is * * f , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axes is * * f . There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas . However , there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol_phthalate ( viscosity 155 poises ) suspended in corn_syrup of 71 poises in a paper by Mason and Bartok . This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of_course , not negligible .</context>

      <context> Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar corpuscular_radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . Further , the corpuscular_radiation , i.e. , the solar_wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive_force to the gravitational_force . The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi major_axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor_axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . Also , planetary gravitational_attraction increases the dust concentration near the <head>plane</head> of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . At one astronomical_unit from the sun ( the Earth 's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about * * f km of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic_energy less than their potential_energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . De_Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more_and_more eccentric without changing the semi major_axis .</context>

      <context> There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment . Direct information has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors . In_addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain . From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal_light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic <head>plane</head> . Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component .

Like a man making a deep dive , Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley .</context>

      <context> Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target . Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte_Gulf area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships . Greg himself took two flights , with Todman leading the second , to patrol and look_for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte . Each <head>plane</head> carried two five-hundred pound bombs . A weapons_carrier took Greg , Todman , Belton , Banjo_Ferguson , and Walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip . It was a rough long ride through the mud and pot_holes . No one had much to say .</context>

The opposing aircraft continued to come_on . They appeared to be the enemy .</context>

      <context> The sky glowered down at them . There was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go_on forever .

His face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot . Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before .
