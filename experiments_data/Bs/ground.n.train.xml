      <context> The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature 's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them . With the exception of the Roman_Catholic and the Orthodox_Catholic_Churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice . Here is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement . The <head>grounds</head> for the Church 's position are Scriptural ( Old_Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural_law . The latter plays a prominent role in Roman_Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods . The Roman_Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end . This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God 's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements .</context>

      <context> Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man . The land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of_this . Earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break . Sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the <head>ground</head> surface ; often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there ; and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried . Today 's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth 's restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them . The effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized . The role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster .</context>

      <context> So_far_as I can see , there is only one way_out for the positivist . He holds that goodness and badness lie_in feelings of approval or disapproval . And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging_to the pain itself . The pain in itself was neutral ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no <head>grounds</head> at_all , took_up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for_the_first_time , and in the only intelligible sense , bad .

The second argument applies the method in the reverse way .

      <context> Because of the size of the areas it covers , the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily , as more than an indication or sign . Literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerangs : the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before . Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it , the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as_well_as start his picture . The actual surface becomes both <head>ground</head> and background , and it turns_out - suddenly and paradoxically - that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in_front of , upon , the surface . In their very first collages , Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain_of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust_out into real , bas-relief space - or to be about to do so - while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in , or flat upon , the surface . And the surface is driven back , in its very surfaceness , only by this contrast . In the upper center of Braque 's first collage , Fruit_Dish ( in Douglas_Cooper 's collection ) , a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture_plane .</context>

      <context> Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching . We tumbled to a stop in Deacon_Gordon 's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle . A dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped_up handfuls of_it . Isaac_Pitt , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket_ball in his belly ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the <head>ground</head> , dying , the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow . It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no_one had time to spend sympathizing_with poor Isaac - except the Reverend .

I was drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from the road , and the fact that I was not afraid now , but only waiting to know what to do next .</context>
