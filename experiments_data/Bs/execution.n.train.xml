      <context> Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition . If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result . Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call ' clicking ' . `` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid <head>execution</head> , he would do_well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition . `` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color . Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in_relation_to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat . When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor - if I have been working on a full sheet in the field .</context>

      <context> They include both individual fears and collective ones . They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not_only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group . Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized . Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous <head>execution</head> one had been unaware of the really decisive act . To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition . But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating . The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave_rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize .</context>

      <context> The Woonsocket_Patriot admitted that John_Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no_more be hung than Henry_A._Wise or James_Buchanan '' . The Newport_Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him . In her letter to John_Brown , `` E._B. '' , the Quakeress from Newport , had suggested that the American people owed more honor to John_Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George_Washington . During the latter days of November to the day of Brown 's <head>execution</head> , it seems that most Rhode_Islanders did not concur in `` E._B. 's '' suggestion . On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown 's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions . A week later the Daily_Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John_Brown on the day of his execution . The editor of the Daily_Journal warned , `` that if such a demonstration be made , it will not find support or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak_for Providence '' .</context>

      <context> Extraordinary precautions were taken so that no stranger be allowed_in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surrounding the scaffold . In many Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church_bells were tolled . Such was not the case in Rhode_Island . The only public demonstration in honor of John_Brown was held at Pratt_'s_Hall in Providence , on the day of his <head>execution</head> . Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt_Hall meeting `` brought_together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many_of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' . Seated on the platform were Amos_C._Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; Thomas_Davis , an uncompromising Garrisonian ; the Reverend_Augustus_Woodbury , a Unitarian minister ; the Reverend_George_T._Day , a Free-Will Baptist ; Daniel_w._Vaughan , and William_H._H._Clements . The latter two were appointed secretaries .</context>

      <context> Troubled , he continued along the corridor , poking his head into the next office for a careful look around . But Hoag had not stayed_on the front steps when Griffith disappeared into the building . He was unwilling to rely_on Griffith 's carrying his message , and he had no confidence the police would act_on it . If Mahzeer was alone with the prime_minister he could be arranging his <head>execution</head> while Hoag stood out here shivering in the darkening street . He would have to do something on_his_own . But what ? The door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down_the_stairs .</context>
