      <context> In February 1801 , Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic_battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead . In the following year , 1803 , Oersted , simultaneously with Davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic_battery more_than did salts . Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded_down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' . He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his <head>rise</head> from boyhood . The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level . His broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him . His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong .</context>

      <context> The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form . There , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism . But in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to_it . One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a <head>rise</head> in temperature , just as electrical bodies do . It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb . By that , one feels that magnetic_forces are as general as electrical forces . An attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as_such '' .</context>

      <context> The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami_Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3000 feet . Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands . The tsunami warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander_C._K._Green of the Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey staff . It consists_of a series of pipes and a pressure measuring chamber which record the <head>rise</head> and fall of the water surface . Ordinary water tides are disregarded . But when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set_in_motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric_circuit . This in_turn sets_off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress .</context>

      <context> But when a board of inquiry was called to look_into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him . He was a member of The Fighting_Seventh . Although it was at the Battle_of_The_Little_Horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history , that the 7_th_Cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then . Brevet_Major_General_George_Armstrong_Custer was the regiment 's first permanent commander and , like such generals as George_S._Patton and Terry_de_la_Mesa_Allen in their <head>rise</head> to military prominence , Custer was a believer in blood_and_guts warfare . During the Civil_War , Custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier_general at the age of 23 . He finished the war as a major_general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major_general in the history of the U._S. Army .</context>

      <context> There is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement : Adam_Smith was wrong . Not_only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism . The <head>rise</head> of the giant corporations in Western Europe and the United_States dates_from the period 1880 - 1900 . Now , although the roots of the mystery_story in serious literature go_back as far as Balzac , Dickens , and Poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19_th century that the private_detective became an established figure in popular fiction . Sherlock_Holmes , the ancestor of all private_eyes , was born during the 1890 s . Thus the transformation of Adam_Smith 's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life .</context>

      <context> Two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2 ( Pyrometer_Instrument_Co. Model 95 ) served for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder . Three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature . Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3 . In this design the anode holder is water_cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature <head>rise</head> of the coolant . To reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the region of the arc , a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder . In_addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum_foil to reduce radiation . Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water_cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account_for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug .</context>

      <context> The mean temperature of this region was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug . It was denoted by **f . The mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation : **f where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot . Assuming thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon , the gas enthalpy <head>rise</head> through the anode was calculated according_to the relation **f whereby the specific_heat of argon was taken as **f . This calculation results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross_section whereas in_reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures . The upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple shown in figure 2 was **f . The **f values are listed in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages .</context>

      <context> Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure . Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built_up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate . A system had_to be used which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time . A back pressure was then introduced , and the <head>rise</head> or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure . By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular_weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an atmosphere . The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper_limit of the apparatus on_hand . The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular_weights which were stated to be 520 and 300 .</context>

      <context> The question of epidemic disease merits some discussion . Only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem . Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics . They then point_out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the <head>rise</head> and fall of epidemics , it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated . They argue further ( and somewhat contradictorily ) that our knowledge and resources in preventive_medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease . this is why this approach to BW defense has not been given major attention . Our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target .</context>

      <context> For internal political reasons , the union asks for ( and accepts ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up_to the discretion of the companies of the industry . Changes in the basic wage rate are cost raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices . However , it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude . In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled_out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage <head>rise</head> . Thus , for non negative changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active wage_setter , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence . The presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case , on the grounds that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously . From this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be_due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model .</context>

      <context> Everywhere within the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; Greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized , and plagued , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors . Further we cannot go , for the Dark_ages deserve their name . Many aspects of civilization were not_yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure . The epic_poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the <head>rise</head> of firm political_units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men - all these had to await the progress of following decades . What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search . These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces . To interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period .</context>
