Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort_Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs . In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per_cent duty on imports via Hudson's_Bay which were viewed_as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' . To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company 's local <head>officials</head> asked that its London authorities refrain_from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . With their customary source of supply cut_off , the Fort_Garry free_traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country . Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St._Paul and goods from St._Paul to Red_River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement . This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per_cent after February 1835 , but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per_cent on the initiative of the London committee .</context>

      <context> But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O_'_Banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans . To forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O_'_Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay . The reception was held in a private dining_room of the Webster_Hotel on Lincoln_Park_West . It was an interesting fraternisation of ex convicts , union racketeers , ward_heelers , sold-out <head>officials</head> , and gunmen . The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time . It included the top O_'_Banion men and Chief_of_Detectives_Michael_Hughes .

      <context> The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco . At the central level the scrutin_uninominal_voting_system was selected over some form of the scrutin_de_liste_system , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political_parties . The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections . Although the elections were for local <head>officials</head> , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates . With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly . Both parties and the Ministry_of_the_Interior were busily at_work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance . Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation .</context>

      <context> Man , through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny .

It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of <head>officials</head> who wielded public authority . Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society . To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative_officials and judges - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with . Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society .</context>
