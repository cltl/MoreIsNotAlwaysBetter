      <context> Even Mr._Miller himself seems uncertain on this score . In a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point : `` However , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer 's many faced lieutenants . And his belief is not to his discredit . Better minds than Hale 's were - and still are - convinced that there is a <head>society</head> of spirits beyond our ken '' . ( page 33 ) On_the_other_hand , a_little later_on he says : `` Since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped_out God 's beard and the Devil 's horns , but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes . The concept of unity , in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force , in which good and evil are relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon - such a concept is still reserved to the physical_sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas .</context>

      <context> While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law . The brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt . They supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could . So impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on <head>society</head> . I lived in this onward driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or banished a previous error '' . He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing_about science . In_this third year at the university , Hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` Limits_of_Poetry_and_Prose '' .</context>

The professor in_turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice .

In one way the Institutes and <head>Societies</head> do a disservice to the schools . That_is in the continuance of the `` grandfather_clauses '' in their membership requirements .

The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him .</context>

      <context> If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . ) In a mobile <head>society</head> , congregational health depends_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like elements will have_to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation . In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per_cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' . If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 per_cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact .</context>

      <context> The word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle .

Presupposed in Plato 's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom .

This is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after World_War_2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace .

Probably the most important thing to focus_on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available . This is in large part a code_of_behavior and a glossary of values : what is it that people do and should do and_how one should regard it . In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of <head>society</head> and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint .

To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors in spirit , the monastic communities , is with an appropriate shift of adjectives , misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato 's Republic : in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes , in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes .

      <context> But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials . Surely there is nothing new about communism . We find it in Plato 's republic , and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book . We find it in that `` common way_of_life pleasing to Christ and still in_use among the truest <head>societies</head> of Christians '' , that_is , the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity . We find it in the later Stoic conception of man 's natural condition which included the community of all possessions . This conception was taken_up by the early Church_Fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle_Ages ; and More was far too well_read not to have come_across it in one or several of the forms thus given it . But although the idea of communism is very old even in More 's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it is not communism as_such that we are concerned with .</context>

      <context> He would send_on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news .

Mynheer , Sir_Francis , the valley <head>society</head> , the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon drenched road .

      <context> Such ranchers as Coble and Clay and the Bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown . He made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped_out in their roundups . In the cow camps , Tom_Horn was regarded_as a hero , as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos . The hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range , waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new <head>society</head> that was threatening a beloved way_of_life . The wailing , guitar strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made_up songs about him . By 1898 , rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming .</context>

      <context> That 's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation . In the Middle_Ages , in the Renaissance , right up_to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world . He was an artisan , a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood_carver did . He filled a real need , showing <head>society</head> what it looked_like , turning it inside_out , portraying its wars and its leaders , its ugliness and its beauties , reflecting its profound religious impulses . He was a propagandist - they were n't afraid of the word , then - satirist , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party . But look_at us today ! We hold safe little jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels , and most_of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity .</context>

      <context> Since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior . Far from it ; I merely draw an etymological distinction , hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman . Above_all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence , to whimper over the loss of a_few objets_d'art , or to shame you into rectitude . My object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions <head>society</head> might inflict . You have unwittingly set_in_motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . Quite candidly , fellows , I would n't be_in_your_shoes for all the rice in China . As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly .</context>
