      <context> Every man who dabbles_in the market to make a_little easy_money on_the_side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb . Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best_seller book to make some dough . People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's-eye achievements . The promoter who wanted to sign him up for the <head>circus</head> asked him how he was able to do it . His answer was simple but honest . He just shot at the board and_then drew circles around the holes to form a bull's-eye . One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2 - year old child is a lack of verbal communication .</context>

      <context> But time is running_out , and many_of Stravinsky 's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra_firma . His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a_house_divided_against_itself : Supra_Expressionism , Neo Paganism , Neo_Classicism , Neo_Romanticism , Neo_Jazz , Neo Ecclesiasticism , Neo Popularism , and most_recently , Post Serialism - all competing with each other within one composer ! What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist ; a maladroit reharmonization of our National_Anthem ( The Star-Spangled_Banner ) ; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ; a <head>circus</head> polka for elephants ; his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs ! Stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home . How differently Prokofieff 's life unfolded . Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction .</context>
