Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind . When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism .

      <context> Suspecting an ambush , the two deputies decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short_cut into Catskill . After spending two nights ( Wednesday and Thursday ) in Catskill , the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business . They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old Garnett_Lee ranch . Half a mile below at the mouth of Salyer_'s_Canyon was an old ranch that the <head>company</head> had purchased from A._J._Armstrong , occupied by a Mexican , his wife , and an old trapper . There were three houses in Salyer_'s_Canyon just at the foot of a low bluff , the road winding along the top , entering above , and_then passing down in_front_of the houses , thence to the Vermejo . To the west of this road was another low bluff , forty or fifty feet high , covered with scrub_oak and other brush . As they were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two bluffs , a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers .</context>

      <context> The officer demanded the names of the injured men ; the Mexicans not_only refused to give them , but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it . Since the strength of the Mexicans had been underrated , too small a posse had been collected , and since the deputy had not been provided with search_warrants , MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw . The posse 's retreat encouraged the Mexicans to be overbearing and impudent . During the following week , six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned ; some buildings , farm tools , two horses , plows , and hay owned by Bonito_Lavato , a friendly interpreter for the <head>company</head> , and Pedro_Chavez ' hay were stolen or destroyed ; and a store was broken into and robbed . District_Attorney M._W._Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms - he just did n't catch anyone . Increasing threats on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New_Mexico . His friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense , perpetuating the troubles .</context>

      <context> At_any_rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington . In 1846 Matthew_B._Goodwin , jeweler and watchmaker , became the town 's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the Equinox_House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont '' . Goodwin was telegrapher for the `` American_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Troy_and_Canada_Junction_Telegraph_Company '' . Shares of capital_stock at $ 15 each in the latter <head>company</head> were payable at the Bank_of_Manchester or at various other Vermont banks . A message of less_than fifteen words to Bennington cost twenty-five cents . By 1871 L._C._Orvis , manager of the `` Western_Union_Telegraph_Company '' , expressed willingness to send emergency telegrams on Sundays from his Village drugstore .

      <context> Orvis even needed to hire an assistant , Clark_J._Wait . The Manchester_Journal commented editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business . In the fall of 1878 , the `` Popular_Telegraph_Line '' was established between Manchester and Factory_Point by the owners , Paul_W._Orvis , Henry_Gray , J._N._Hard , and Clark_J._Wait . The line soon lived_up_to its name , as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the <head>company</head> was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital_stock . In 1879 the same Clark_Wait , with H._H._Holley of South_Dorset , formed the `` American_Telegraph_Line '' , extending from Manchester_Depot via Factory_Point and South_Dorset to Dorset . Besides being most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good investment for the owners '' .
