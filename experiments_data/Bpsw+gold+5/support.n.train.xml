      <context> There was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white_heat . Not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent . Those would be reserved for the orchestra 's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself . This time the orchestra gave him some superb <head>support</head> fired by response to his own high mood . But he had in Walter_Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point . That_is , when Mr._Milstein thrust straight to the core of the music , sparks flying , bow shredding , violin singing , glittering and sometimes spitting , Mr._Hendl could go_along . But Mr._Hendl does not go straight to any point .</context>

      <context> The only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard_to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries . As early as 1858 , Le_Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries in human_beings . In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz . The opposition to this point_of_view has its staunchest <head>support</head> in the work of Miller ( ' 50 ) . Apparently , however , Miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and cats , and he has been criticized for using pathologic human material in his normal study ( Loosli , ' 38 ) . Although Miller noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals , nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian lungs other_than in the dog and cat ( Miller , ' 13 ; ' 25 ) . The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial_artery as found in the horse is not clear .</context>
