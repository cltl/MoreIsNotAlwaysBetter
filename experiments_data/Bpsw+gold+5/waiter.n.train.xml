      <context> Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry_O_'_Connor , the proprieter of a Loop gambling_house . `` But when I arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective bureau basement half_a_dozen times , I knew I had been framed , and withdrew almost at_once '' . In_fact , O_'_Connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $ 2500 diamond stickpin . There was a brief interruption while one of O_'_Banion 's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a <head>waiter</head> who was pestering him for a tip . Then O_'_Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds . This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more_or_less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek_by_jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928_-_29 '' .</context>

      <context> The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy_houses , honkytonks , and sawdust_saloons of his birthplace ; he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went_through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police dodging , and housebreaking . At the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the Loop , he was knocked_down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg . Because of this he was known_as Gimpy ( but , as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface , never in his presence ) . In his teens O_'_Banion was enrolled in the vicious Market_Street gang and he became a singing <head>waiter</head> in McGovern's_Cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North_Clark_Street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown_out . He then got a job with the Chicago_Herald-Examiner as a circulation_slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper 's news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors . He was also at_the_same_time gaining practical experience as a safe_breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene_Geary , later committed to Chester_Asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor . O_'_Banion 's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell_Prison for three months for burglary ; two years later he served another three months for assault .</context>

      <context> The breaking_away from the prison_house of Brooklyn is gradual . First , the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights . Then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying_forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of New_York . It is significant that the Catskills , which used_to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of New_York , no_longer attracts them in great numbers - except for those who work there as <head>waiters</head> , bus_boys , or counselors in the day_camps . The great world beyond beckons . But it should be pointed_out that some of the new watering_places - Fire_Island , Nantucket , Westhampton , Long_Island , for_example - tend to be homogeneously Jewish . Although Brooklyn_College does not_yet have a junior year abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in Europe .</context>
