      <context> The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' . Other recommendations made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any <head>relatives</head> , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity . Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy .</context>

      <context> Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro community . Occasionally they would write to the slaves . Early in the war it was not uncommon for planters ' sons to retain in camp Negro `` body_servants '' to perform the menial chores such_as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoes , and laundering clothes . Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier masters messages to their <head>relatives</head> and to members of their owners ' families . Unmarried soldiers carried_on correspondence with sweethearts at home . Owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19_th century America , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling . Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond , Petersburg , Washington , or Nashville .</context>

      <context> This meant , concretely , that the patient could not read at_all without making writing like movements of the head or body , became easily confused by `` hasher_marks '' inserted between hand-written words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters , and could recognize a simple straight_line or a curved one only by tracing it . The patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at_all ; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him . After a conversation with another man , he was able to recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe at_all what the other man looked_like . Nor could he call_up memory-pictures of close friends or <head>relatives</head> . In_short , both his own declarations and his figural_blindness , when he looked at objects , seem to present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at_all . He was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed , precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape , already learned and held in visual memory , as persons of normal vision do . He could not recognize it ; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at_all .</context>
