      <context> The long road that had taken liberals in_this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State . And the USSR existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in_this country was spiritually Marxist . We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman <head>administration</head> gathered with other Western utopians in San_Francisco to set_up the legal framework , finally and at_last , to rationalize war - to rationalize want and fear - out of the world : the United_Nations . We of the liberal led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation . Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally . During the next five years the leaders of the Fair_Deal reluctantly backed_down from the optimistic expectations of the New_Deal .</context>

When suitable equipment is_located by the SBA representative , the small business_concern is contacted and advised on when , where , and how to bid on such property . Section 8 ( b ) ( 2 ) of the Small_Business_Act , as amended , authorizes the SBA to make a complete inventory of the productive facilities of small business_concerns . The <head>Administration</head> maintains a productive facilities inventory of small business industrial concerns that have voluntarily registered . It is kept in each Regional office for the small firms within the region . Purpose of this inventory is to include all eligible productive facilities in SBA 's facilities register so that the small business_concerns may have an opportunity to avail themselves of the services authorized by the Congress in establishing the Small_Business_Administration . These services include procurement and technical assistance and notice of surplus sales and invitations to bid on Government contracts for products and services within the registrants ' field_of_operations .</context>

It is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of <head>administration</head> officials , Members of Congress , officers in the Pentagon . As a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions . Among these questions : Military experts say a tight naval_blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task_forces , each built around an aircraft_carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers .</context>

      <context> The former comprise analeptic and psychoactive_drugs , the latter the tranquilizers . Specific differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging_to the same group as , for_instance , between reserpine and chlorpromazine . Important as these differences are , they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side , we produce depressions , whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and , eventually , maniclike changes . The emotional_states produced by drugs influence the cortical_potentials in a characteristic manner ; synchrony prevails in the EEG of the experimental animal after <head>administration</head> of tranquilizers , but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive_drugs . The shock_therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance . Physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges . They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side .</context>

      <context> Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first_steps to organize rural communes . All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . Considerable technical skill was used and the <head>administration</head> of the elections was generally above reproach . However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances . A third aspect , and probably the one open_to most controversy , is the results of the election . The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested parties , including the government itself , were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections .</context>
