      <context> The First Lord of the Treasury is the head of the commission exercising <head>the</head> ancient office of Lord High Treasurer in the United Kingdom , and is now always also the Prime Minister . This office is not equivalent to the usual position of the " Treasurer " in other governments ; the closer equivalent of a Treasurer in the United Kingdom is the Chancellor of the Exchequer . As of the beginning of the 17th century , the running of the Treasury was frequently entrusted to a commission , rather than to a single individual .</context>

This claim is based on an entry in the Domesday Book showing the individual Henry " the treasurer " as a landowner in Winchester , the place where the royal treasure was stored . The Treasury of the United Kingdom thus traces its origins to the Treasury of the Kingdom of England , which had come into existence by 1126 , in the reign of Henry I. The Treasury emerged from the Royal Household , and served as the location where the king kept his treasures .</context>

      <context> But hear Harrison_E._Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The_New_York_Times , and author of `` To_Moscow_-_And_Beyond '' . In a book review of `` The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State_Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West_Contacts_Staff in_order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy_and_Bess ' overrode the State_Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz_musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo_montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry_Ford , Hugh_Cooper , Thomas_Campbell , the International_Harvester_Co. , and David_W._Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal <head>treasury</head> or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' . Perhaps the public 's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no_more exists in America . In his stead is a milquetoast version known_as `` the corporation '' .</context>
