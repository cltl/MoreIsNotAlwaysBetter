      <context> We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry . The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality . When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering . The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this <head>area</head> alone , the application of electronic_equipment has enormous possibilities . The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by_far than any previous medical discovery . We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research . Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray_machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy_machine .</context>

      <context> When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O_'_Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $ 20000 a month . In six months O_'_Banion had boosted the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb . These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; once_again O_'_Banion 's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill_will . The revenue from O_'_Banion 's Cicero territory went_up still higher , until the yield was more_than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade <head>area</head> of Chicago 's South and West_Sides . But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate . At_last , even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O_'_Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in_return for one from his Cicero beer concession . O_'_Banion 's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .</context>

      <context> Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high_school described in my first report . The separate vocational or technical high_schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions . By_and_large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system . It is not often realized to_what_degree certain trades are in many communities closed <head>areas</head> of employment , except for a lucky few . One has_to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high_schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` I want to be a plumber '' , and then , by doing good work , find a job . It is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get_into the most selective medical_school in the nation . Two stories will illustrate what I have_in_mind .</context>

      <context> Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society . Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by_any_means other_than the corporate form , e._g. constructing major airports or dams . Thus , if corporations are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject_to public control and needs . In all other <head>areas</head> , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services . Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human_beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests . Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot . It can project long-range goals for itself .</context>

      <context> There have been a number of sound plans proposed . But none of these has been implemented . Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping_hand . Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan <head>areas</head> each_day has increased tremendously since World_War_2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957 . Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New_York_City area . Here the New_York_Central_Railroad , one of the Nation 's most important carriers , has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949 . At this time of crisis in our Nation 's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New_York_Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake_+_Ohio_Railroad 's proposal for control of the Baltimore_+_Ohio_railroads .</context>

      <context> The New_York_Central has pointed_out that this control , if approved by the Interstate_Commerce_Commission , would give the combined C.+O. - B.+O._Railroad a total of 185 points served in_common with the New_York_Central . Not_only is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New_York_Central and other railroads serving the area . The New_York_Central notes : `` The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. +_O._-_B. +_O. provides the backbone of Central 's revenues . These revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New_York_Central system as_well_as the New_York <head>area</head> commuter and terminal freight services . If these services are to be maintained , the New_York_Central must have the revenues to make them possible '' . The New_York_Central today handles 60 percent of all southbound commuter_traffic coming into New_York_City . This is a $ 14 million operation involving 3500 employees who work_on commuter_traffic exclusively .</context>

      <context> Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . For_example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . Let us now put some flesh_on_the_theoretical_bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . One should keep in mind that many_of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other <head>areas</head> . The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive - and the rate_of_attrition due_to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high . It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired - and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed .</context>

      <context> While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure . The objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts . In_addition , the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed . The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training <head>area</head> . The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold : Spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new .</context>
