      <context> <head>Incidents</head> such as the 1965 Watts Riots , the videotaped 1991 beating by Los Angeles Police officers of Rodney King , and the riot following their acquittal have been suggested by some people to be evidence that U.S. police are dangerously lacking in appropriate controls .

Police departments and the local governments that oversee them in some jurisdictions have attempted to mitigate some of these issues through community outreach programs and community policing to make the police more accessible to the concerns of local communities , by working to increase hiring diversity , by updating training of police in their responsibilities to the community and under the law , and by increased oversight within the department or by civilian commissions .</context>

      <context> The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the <head>police</head> , and an intruding government tutor . The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue_pie , gets a plate of English_muffins instead . Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after_all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks_Atkinson retired . Aging but still precocious , French feline enfant_terrible Francoisette_Lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old Paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called The_Lascivious_Interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in_love with a middle-aged steam_shovel .</context>
