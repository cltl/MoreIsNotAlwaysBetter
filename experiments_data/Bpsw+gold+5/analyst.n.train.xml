      <context> Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the " analysand " ( analytic <head>patient</head> ) verbally expresses his or her thoughts , including free associations , fantasies , and dreams , from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient 's symptoms and character problems , and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems . The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient 's pathological defenses , wishes and guilt . Through the analysis of conflicts , including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions , psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies : how unconscious , symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms .</context>

      <context> The various approaches in treatment called " psychoanalysis " vary as much as the theories do . The term also refers to a method of analysing child development .

      <context> The fact that many <head>of</head> such patients also demonstrate deficits above makes diagnosis and treatment selection difficult . Analytical organizations such as the IPA , APsaA and the European Federation for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy have established procedures and models for the indication and practice of psychoanalytical therapy for trainees in analysis . The match between the analyst and the patient can be viewed as another contributing factor for the indication and contraindication for psychoanalytic treatment .</context>

      <context> In_addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever expanding and changing society . The problems confuse even the experts . For_that_matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed . Anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , <head>analysts</head> or some combination of the four . They have widely varying backgrounds and aims . They have little `` esprit_de_corps '' . The outlook for the amateur , for_instance , is usually dependent_on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque .</context>

      <context> The amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more_than the amateur who has taken_to the field . The collector enjoys the contact with rural life ; he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream '' reasons that many persons hunt game ; and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located . Fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them do n't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material . But there are also the commercial propagandists and the <head>analysts</head> - one dominated_by money , the other by nineteenth century German scholarship . Both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found . Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage_system and the electric light lines . The commercial propagandist , who can n't afford to be critical , gets_along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst 's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine .</context>

If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public .</context>

      <context> Tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone . The possibilities are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater . Often , therefore , there are a number of rules having the same effect , and commonly other sets of rules as_well , having the opposite effect . Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning <head>analyst</head> than consonantal morphophonemics , even when the total number of rules is no greater . The difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology is an inverse_function of the size - smaller systems are more troublesome - for any given degree of morphophonemic complexity . This hypothesis will account_for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis , as well as the fact that vowel_systems are often more puzzling than consonantal_systems . The statement of the system is a different matter .</context>
