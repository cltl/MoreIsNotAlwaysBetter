      <context> Of_course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr._Fisher , then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury , to the Vatican last December . It was the first time an English Primate has done this since the 14th century . English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope . Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants ; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary_school during the sickness of one of its masters ; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` Catholics , if the present <head>system</head> is still in_operation , will constitute almost one-third of the House_of_Lords in the next generation '' ; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic_church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave .</context>

      <context> Two of the fluids showed a high positive normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in_comparison_with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two . Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure . Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built_up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate . A <head>system</head> had_to be used which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time . A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure . By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular_weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an atmosphere . The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper_limit of the apparatus on_hand .</context>

      <context> Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon_tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data . It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical_reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation_energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free_radicals , as_well_as information on the heat_of_dissociation of the carbon halogen bond . The reaction of chlorine with carbon_tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies . It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum <head>system</head> followed by multiple distillation of the liquid . It should be possible to free carbon_tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine . Furthermore , the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain_reaction since the activation_energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high ; also it would be expected that * * f would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for * * f radicals . Contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish , even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents .</context>

      <context> Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional_arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . A previously extinguished conditioned_reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . It seems to follow that by_and_large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as_far_as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two <head>systems</head> determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . In_addition , the neocortical hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates . But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such_as the rat , sex_activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral_brain is enhanced by the neocortex . MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral_brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic_brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related_to fight and flight and also on sexual functions .</context>

      <context> The shock_therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance . Physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges . They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side . This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock_therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic <head>system</head> as shown by the Mecholyl_test . Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl_test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm . Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not_yet been tested on an adequate number of patients . The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable .</context>

The insuperable reward <head>systems</head> that most religions embody have great motivating effects . Religion provides the most attractive rewards , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely abide_by its norms , but who engage in good works .

      <context> On_the_one_hand , the major European_nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience . But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard_to most_of the rest of the world . Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere . Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin_America ( though limited in Latin_America by the special interest of the United_States as expressed in the Monroe_Doctrine , itself from the outset related_to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance_of_power '' <head>system</head> in Europe ) was necessary in_order to preserve both common economic_values and the European `` balance '' itself . A nation such_as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied_upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin_American countries ; out_of_the_question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa . This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19_th century scholars . More emphasis was put upon the fact that international_law was the law of `` civilized nations '' ; Kent and Story , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made_use_of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent .</context>

During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal <head>system</head> of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states .

In both respects , international_law was Europeanized . It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions .</context>
