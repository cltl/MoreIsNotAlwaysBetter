      <context> So he picked_up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . Until a_few weeks ago , however , Arnold_Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in_common with the duffers . But after that 12 at Los_Angeles he became one_of_the_boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis_Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National_Football_League owners at a meeting at the Hotel_Warwick <head>today</head> . Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football 's hall_of_fame , players ' benefits and constitutional amendments . The owners would_like each club in the fourteen team league to play a home and home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division . However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks .</context>

      <context> He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach . Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green_Bay_Packers . The Eagles signed him for Shaw 's staff in 1959 . Skorich began his new job auspiciously <head>today</head> . At a ceremony in the reception_room of Mayor_Richardson_Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William_A._Bill_Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night 's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New_York Chapter , Baseball_Writers_Association_of_America , at the Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel .</context>

      <context> If a child watched its progress he whispered , `` Hay , hay , load of hay - make a wish and turn_away '' , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses ' feet returned no_more . When the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a huckster 's cart might turn the corner . The horse walked , the reins were slack , the huckster rode with bowed shoulders , his forearms across his knees . Sleepily , as if half reluctant to break the silence , he lifted his voice : `` Rhu-beb ni_ice fresh rhu-beb <head>today</head> '' ! The lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee . No one seemed to hear him , no one heeded . The horse plodded on , and he repeated his call .</context>

      <context> For the past 40 years Congress has advocated a carefully planned , balanced and competitive railway_system . We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter - the two-way B. +_O._-_C._+ O. merger , or the three_way New_York_Central B._+_O._-_C._+_O. merger . Which will serve not_only the best interest of the stockholders , but the interests of all the traveling public ? Mr._Speaker , I rise <head>today</head> to pay tribute to a great newspaper , the New_York_Times , on the occasion of a major change in its top_executive command . Arthur_Hays_Sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement . I am pleased to note that Mr._Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman_of_the_board of the New_York_Times . Mr._Sulzberger 's successor as publisher is Mr._Orvil_E._Dryfoos , who is president of the New_York_Times_Co. , and who has been with the Times since 1942 .</context>

      <context> Papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing youth : `` Idle recreation '' ! Stevie saw no idols ; it troubled him that he could n't always see what Papa saw . He was torn between the excitement in the sun inflamed waters and a little engine chugging northward on the Monticello_Branch . `` Where you been <head>today</head> '' ? Ludie inquired every evening , pretending that he did not care . `` He'll make a preacher out of you '' ! `` No , he won't '' !</context>

      <context> She was the only kind of Negro Laura_Andrus would want around : independent , unservile , probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework - and doubly efficient . When the parents emerged from the bedroom a_few minutes later , the maid greeted them quietly . `` I'm awful sorry about what 's happened '' , Selena said . `` Maybe <head>today</head> 'll be a good news day '' . She charged off to the bedrooms . Moll took his coffee into the nursery . During the night , a phone_company technician had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones .</context>

      <context> Mendoza did n't wake until nearly nine thirty . It was going_to be another hot day ; already the thermometer stood close_to ninety . Alison was still sound asleep ; he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk drawers for more cigarettes before thinking_of her handbag , and found a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom , which tasted peculiarly of face_powder . He left a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime <head>today</head> , and drove home . After he 'd got_out fresh liver for Bast , he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish . Surely she was just a_trifle fatter around the middle ? He seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians had large litters , and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens .</context>

      <context> What remained lacked the original verve but it was at_least dignified , as befitting the tragic circumstances . Raymond_Fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed `` Cradle_Song '' in_case it was needed . Charlie_Marble was back_and_forth on several occasions , first to confer_with Andy on the advisability of cancelling the Las_Vegas engagement - they decided it was wise - and later to announce that a prominent comedian , also an agency client , had agreed to fill the casino 's open date . And once Bake slipped in , pale and drawn , last night 's liquor still on his breath with some of <head>today</head> 's added to_it . He asked if there was anything he could do . Andy invented a job to keep him busy , sending him ahead to El_Dorado to supervise last_minute arrangements . But from Rocco_Vecchio , they heard nothing .</context>
