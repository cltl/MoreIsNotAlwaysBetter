      <context> Directionality is greatly exaggerated most_of the time ; but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music . You definitely hear some of the instruments close_up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back . This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound . London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a <head>number</head> of separate tape channels . These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record . In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special_effects . Some clue to the character of London 's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion '' or `` percussive '' .</context>

      <context> The English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty_Martyrs and Cardinal_Newman will soon be canonized . Because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , English Catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being `` English '' . I have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in_the_air . For_example , a writer in a recent <head>number</head> of The_Queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un English '' ' . In this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics , priests and laity , in England , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics , especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good . One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken_place since the mid 19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge_Universities . At Oxford one_hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 .</context>

A <head>number</head> of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather_than by the natural portal of entry . Some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle size than by the natural portal .

In some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , making diagnosis difficult .</context>

This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock_therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl_test . Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl_test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm . Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not_yet been tested on an adequate <head>number</head> of patients . The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable . It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep wakefulness cycle . A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting .</context>

      <context> one cannot assume , of_course , that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later_on when the stereotype was uttered ; probably it is correct to think_of it as a matter of a well grooved , stereotyped mode of expression - and no , or but a_few , other communicational grooves , as_yet - being there , available for the patient 's use , as newly emerging emotions and ideas well_up in him over the course of months . But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at_work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another . Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype - a `` How are you now '' ? or an `` I want to go_home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning .

      <context> When the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` What is that , Bill - hello or farewell '' ? , the patient replied , `` Both , Dearie - two in one '' . Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression , that which seems best to give release , and communicational expression , to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter . It is no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient , the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients , shows , as one of his characteristic symptoms , laughter - laughter which now makes one feel scorned or hated , which now makes one feel_like weeping , or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man 's despair ; and which , more often than all these , conveys a welter of feelings which could in_no_way be conveyed by any <head>number</head> of words , words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another . To a much less full extent , the hebephrenic person 's belching or flatus has a comparable communicative function ; in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at_least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch , or the passage of flatus , not_only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze , but also because he learns that even these animal like sounds constitute forms of communication in which , from_time_to_time , quite different things are being said , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings and concepts , to say them in words . As I have been intimating , in the schizophrenic - and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic ; this is a question which I have no wish to take_up - condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well sorted_out , but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well differentiated from one another . Freeman , Cameron and McGhie , in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard_to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation '' .</context>

For a <head>number</head> of years Kentucky , Louisiana and several other states have been building state sponsored vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties . These schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts .

Courses are provided mainly for post high_school day programs ; but sometimes arrangements also are made for high_school students to attend , and evening extension courses also may be conducted .</context>

      <context> Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political_system that was central to world politics for a century . International_law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European_nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international_law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political_system in which a <head>number</head> of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; second , it had to be compatible with the value_system that they shared . In both respects , international_law was Europeanized . It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions . On_the_one_hand , the major European_nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience .</context>

      <context> Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere . Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin_America ( though limited in Latin_America by the special interest of the United_States as expressed in the Monroe_Doctrine , itself from the outset related_to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance_of_power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in_order to preserve both common economic_values and the European `` balance '' itself . A nation such_as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied_upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin_American countries ; out_of_the_question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa . This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a <head>number</head> of 19_th century scholars . More emphasis was put upon the fact that international_law was the law of `` civilized nations '' ; Kent and Story , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made_use_of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent . Wheaton stated that the public_law was essentially `` limited to the civilized and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European origin '' . Of_course it had always been of European origin in_fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural_law theory .</context>

      <context> Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed countries . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A <head>number</head> of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality .</context>

      <context> In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated . No suburban shopping-center branch - not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store . Telephone_orders distort the picture : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather_than a central city <head>number</head> if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminates city sales_tax . The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened . Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are . In many cases that statement `` We break_even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' would be turned_around if the cost_analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store .</context>
