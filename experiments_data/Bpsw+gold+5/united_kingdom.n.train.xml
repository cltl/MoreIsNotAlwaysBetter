      <context> A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more_than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region . Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present . The results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1000 to 10000 * * f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from * * f to * * f times normal density . In March , 1961 , representatives of the national laboratories of Australia , Canada , The_Netherlands , <head>United_Kingdom</head> , U._S._S._R. , United_States , and West_Germany , met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 * * f . As a first_step toward this goal , arrangements were worked_out for comparing the scales now in_use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance_thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory . Such a group of thermometers was obtained and calibrated at the NBS . These thermometers have now been sent to the United_Kingdom for calibration at the National_Physical_Laboratory .</context>

During the last week of march 1961 , Columbus , Ohio was the site of the Fourth_Symposium_on_Temperature , Its_Measurement_and_Control_in_Science_and_Industry . The Symposium , which was jointly sponsored by the American_Institute_of_Physics , the Instrument_Society_of_America , and the National_Bureau_of_Standards , attracted nearly one_thousand registrants , including many from abroad . The Bureau contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr._W._A._Wildhack , General_Chairman , and Dr._C._M._Herzfeld , Program_Chairman .</context>
