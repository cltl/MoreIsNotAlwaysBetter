      <context> Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high_school described in my first report . The separate vocational or technical high_schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions . By_and_large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system . It is not often realized to_what_degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of <head>employment</head> , except for a lucky few . One has_to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high_schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` I want to be a plumber '' , and then , by doing good work , find a job . It is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get_into the most selective medical_school in the nation . Two stories will illustrate what I have_in_mind .</context>

      <context> Adult_education courses , work-study_programs of various sorts - these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth . In_general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high_school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next . If the student drops_out of high_school , the break with the school is even more complete . When there is <head>employment</head> opportunity for youth , this arrangement - or lack of arrangement - works_out quite well . Indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work . Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one . I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high_school and was highly successful in the business which he entered .</context>

      <context> Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78_th_Congress in 1943 passed P._L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure . Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative <head>employment</head> to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services .</context>

      <context> From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public_Law 236 , 66_th_Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation_program has been to assist the States , by means of grants-in-aid , to return disabled men and women to productive , gainful <head>employment</head> . The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation_program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social_Security_Act in 1935 .

      <context> The engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life - and refused to change it . We may say that his attitude was foolish , since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills ; or we may say that his attitude was commendable , showing his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others . In_any_case , he refused to accept the implications of the analysis , that he needed to be made_over . Another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis , and also of the <head>employment</head> of a procedure for intensive analysis . In a course for supermarket operators , a district_manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly successful as a store manager , found that in supervising other managers he was having a difficult time .

      <context> All the manuals for setting_up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the growth of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content . Furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys . Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded_as more hypothetical . While the U._S. Department_of_Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational <head>employment</head> trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning . The U._S. Office_of_Education continues to stress local surveys rather_than national surveys . This procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment . Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in_order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training_programs for those skills .</context>

      <context> They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas . An extension of this program into the other distressed areas should be undertaken . Some of this trend toward area vocational_schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry . The major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of pre <head>employment</head> training for a large_number of semi-skilled machine operators . A_few key skilled_workers experienced in the company 's type of work usually must be brought_in with the plant manager , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere . A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training_programs in the area to supply future skilled_workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees . The existence of a public_school vocational training_program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled .</context>
