Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual , as in an absolute monarchy , or where power is held by a small number of individuals , as in an oligarchy .</context>

      <context> Why should this be so ? It is true that New_England , more_than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start . But I think that something more than this is involved . How did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of American <head>democracy</head> , failed to flourish in New_England as it did in other parts of the country ? Is n't it a_bit odd that the three states of Southern New_England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode_Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A_+_M_colleges ? Was it supposed , perchance , that A_+_M ( vocational_training , that_is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant_class which flooded that part of the New_England world in the post Civil_War period , the immigrants having been brought_in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make_up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ?
