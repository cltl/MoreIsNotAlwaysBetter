      <context> Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded_down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' . He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood . The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level . His broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many <head>doors</head> to him . His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong . The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek_out the philosophers as he had on his first journey . In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws_of_nature in German and this was issued in French translation ( Paris , 1813 ) under the title Recherches_sur_l_'_identite_des_forces_chimiques_et_electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists .</context>

      <context> Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field . A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy . The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials . When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the <head>door</head> of consciousness and clamors for entrance . These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice . The presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even_though it is but vaguely understood . Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed .</context>

      <context> No suburban shopping-center branch - not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store . Telephone_orders distort the picture : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather_than a central city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminates city sales_tax . The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass <head>doors</head> had never opened . Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are . In many cases that statement `` We break_even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' would be turned_around if the cost_analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store . Fear of the competition - always a great motivating force in the American economy - makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival 's shiny new branches .</context>

      <context> The same month that Alastor was published , Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The_Siege_of_Corinth , a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley 's generosity rebelled at . The lordly poet was at low-water_mark . The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent . On all sides <head>doors</head> were being slammed in his face . The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity . Now , under the impact of his wife 's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be . He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half_sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted_in would involve them in a common ruin .</context>
