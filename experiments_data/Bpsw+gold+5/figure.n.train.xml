      <context> Almost every official who reflects on_it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets . You read various guesses on how many Americans are camping . The number depends_on who is talking at the moment . The <head>figures</head> range as high as 15 million families . I 've heard 10 million mentioned often , but I 'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping . Seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more . Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable .</context>

      <context> For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile . She would have said triumph . Then Angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen .

For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; then she snorted and groped_for her fork . There 's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green_beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling_away of a family . Procreation , expansion , proliferation - these are the laws of living_things , with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments : oblivion .</context>
