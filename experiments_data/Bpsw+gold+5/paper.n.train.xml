A group of researchers at the University_of_Washington have given a <head>paper</head> which briefly outlines some of these techniques . One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched .

Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood_vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy .</context>

O_'_Banion 's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell_Prison for three months for burglary ; two years later he served another three months for assault . Those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery .</context>

      <context> This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields . The relation between osmotic_pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way . In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics_of_equilibrium ( referred to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady state . This can be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate <head>paper</head> which is being prepared . This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' . There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed_out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar . If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar .</context>

      <context> This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason . If a is the major_axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes , the radius_of_curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis is * * f , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axes is * * f .

However , there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol_phthalate ( viscosity 155 poises ) suspended in corn_syrup of 71 poises in a <head>paper</head> by Mason and Bartok . This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of_course , not negligible . Measurements on the photograph in this paper give * * f at the maximum rate of shear of * * f .

This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head * * f since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes . These experiments can be considered exploratory only . However , they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the <head>paper</head> .

      <context> ( This provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality '' . ) But the inner , formal_logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shaping their decision . When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesized '' - into larger planar shapes themselves simply in_order to maintain the integrity of the picture_plane . Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut_away too abruptly into depth ; and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted <head>paper</head> would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump_out of plane . Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to_the_extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) . It was because of this chain-reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_objects , or at_least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there .</context>

      <context> These areas by_virtue_of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued - and set to shuttling again - only by conventional perspective ; that_is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in_order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on <head>paper</head> , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas . It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's , which would confirm the date he assigns it . But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as_well_as of typography ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 .</context>

During the morning hours , it became clear that the arrest of Spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the Somers . Those named in the Greek <head>paper</head> were manufacturing reasons to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty , so_as to be near Spencer , watching an opportunity to communicate with him . Hostile glances were flashed at both Alexander and Gansevoort . The two met in the Captain 's cabin . `` What is the next step , Captain '' ?</context>

      <context> In the tiny cabin , Alexander met with Gansevoort , Heiser and Wales to speak and to listen . Three days had passed since Spencer 's arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears . Gansevoort said , `` It requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely . To have the Greek <head>paper</head> is not the great help that at first flush it seemed . From actions aboard , it is easy to guess that Spencer 's boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate '' . `` Well '' , Heiser ventured , `` why do n't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' - `` That would be worse than useless '' , Alexander broke_in .</context>

Mr._Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of <head>paper</head> and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn_into a workbench .

      <context> Journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips . Not long_ago a newspaper advised those taking_part in a contest that `` snapshots must be of a person not larger than * * f inches '' . Classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions . Readers of the Reader_'s_Digest are familiar_with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips , like the ad in a California <head>paper</head> that advertised `` House for rent .
