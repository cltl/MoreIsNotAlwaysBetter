      <context> Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development . This is a highly speculative venture . Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract . When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep_up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential <head>value</head> of the farm . If you have a year-round , full-time job you can n't expect to grow much more than your family uses - unless other members of the family do a good_deal of the work or you hire help . As a rule , part-time farmers hire little help . In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 .</context>

      <context> Observing their distressing condition , Colonel_Snelling allowed these half starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation . As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota , Dousman of Michilimackinac , Michigan , and Prairie_du_Chien was traveling_to Red_River to open a trade in merchandise . Early in 1822 he was at Fort_Garry offering to bring_in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco . Alexander_McDonnell , governor of Red_River , and James_Bird , a chief factor of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , ordered such `` sundry articles '' to a <head>value</head> of 4500 . For its part the Hudson's_Bay_Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement . As the time drew_near for the drawing of the British American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the Pembina_colony - its own post and Fort_Daer - was on American territory . Accordingly Selkirk 's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by October , John_Halkett had torn_down both posts , floating the timber to `` the Forks '' in rafts .</context>

The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles .

      <context> Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45 ` to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear . According_to Philippoff , the recoverable shear s is given by * * f where |c is the angle_of_extinction . From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the * * f calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face . There is another means which should show the direction and relative <head>value</head> of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as_such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields . These droplets are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one 's hands . These droplets appear to be ellipsoids , and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are . If they are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation .</context>

      <context> This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of_course , not negligible . Measurements on the photograph in this paper give * * f at the maximum rate of shear of * * f . If it is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of * * f , cosec 2lc applies , the pressure difference along the major_axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major_axis , and from this the interfacial_tension can be calculated . Its <head>value</head> was * * f from the above data . This appears to be high , as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops . It is appropriate to call_attention_to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal_gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation . The internal energy of an ideal_gas depends_on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume .</context>

      <context> Even here there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity . Spring used a Brush surface analyzer in a metal cleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending_upon surface roughness . There are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard surface cleaning . Exclusive of esthetic <head>values</head> , such_as high - or low foam level , perfume content , etc. , the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high . No matter how they are formulated , a large_number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this application , since they do not give adequate soil removal . This is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation . A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings ; whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a build-up of `` tattle-tale_grey '' and dirty spots - sometimes with bad results even after the first wash .</context>

      <context> Harris has indicated that two devices , the Launder-Ometer and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent testing , and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics . Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use . The soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash . In this way , numerical <head>values</head> for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance ( whiteness ) of the cloth swatches before and after washing . Soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones . As_is the case with the surface-active_agent , the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high . Large_numbers of potential builders have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in_practice .</context>

      <context> The strip sections containing a given protein were pooled , eluted with 0.5 ml of isotonic saline , and the eluates were tested for antibody activity . Fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at_least 500 volumes of phosphate buffered saline , pH 7.2 , ionic strength 0.154 . They were then centrifuged at 59780 rpm for 35 to 80 min at 20 ` C in a Spinco model E ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 1.00 to 1.25 % .

For preparative ultracentrifugation , fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less , transferred to cellulose tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline . Ultracentrifugation was then carried_out in a Spinco model L ultracentrifuge at 40000 rpm for 125 to 150 min , refrigeration being used throughout the run .

      <context> The new interchange among the four Los_Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square_mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller_Center in New_York . It is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls `` the highest and best use '' of centrally located urban land . As it affects the city 's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . Subways improved land <head>values</head> without taking_away land ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by_a_long_shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed . Downtown Los_Angeles is already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking_lot and garage - one of those preposterous `` if '' statistics has already come to pass . The freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access problem , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , isolating boundary . City planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might .</context>
