      <context> In heraldry , a charge is any emblem or device occupying <head>the</head> field of an escutcheon ( shield ) . This may be a geometric design ( sometimes called an ordinary ) or a symbolic representation of a person , animal , plant , object or other device .

      <context> The term charge can also be used as a verb ; for example , if an escutcheon depicts three <head>lions</head> , then it is said to be charged with three lions ; similarly , a crest or even a charge itself may be " charged " , such as a pair of eagle wings charged with trefoils ( e.g. Coat of arms of Brandenburg ) . It is important to distinguish between the ordinaries and divisions of the field , as these typically follow similar patterns , such as a shield divided " per chevron " , as distinct from being charged with a chevron . While thousands of objects found in nature , mythology or technology have appeared in armory , there are several charges ( such as the cross , the eagle and the lion ) which have contributed to the distinctive flavour of heraldic design .</context>

      <context> Esmarch was among those who witnessed Oersted 's first demonstration of his discovery . The association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic_forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades . Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles . In the late 1700 's Beccaria and van_Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic <head>charge</head> through it . Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden_jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch spring steel making its ends magnetic . The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise . The experiments of Romagnosi and_others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause and effect relationship between these two primary forces .</context>
