      <context> It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's , which would confirm the date he assigns it . But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as_well_as of typography ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 . When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each . ( It makes no real difference that Braque 's collage is on_paper and eked_out in charcoal , while Picasso 's is on canvas and eked_out in <head>oil</head> . ) By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done .
