      <context> The earliest modern circuses were performed in open air structures with limited <head>covered</head> seating . From the late 18th to late 19th century bespoke circus buildings ( often wooden ) were built with various types of seating , a centre ring and sometimes a stage . The ' traditional ' large tents , commonly known as ' Big Tops ' were introduced in the mid 19th century as touring circuses superseded static venues .</context>

      <context> First attested in English 14th century , the word circus derives from Latin circus , <head>which</head> is the romanization of the Greek κίρκος ( kirkos ) , itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek κρίκος ( krikos ) , meaning " circle " or " ring " . In the book De Spectaculis early Christian writer Tertullian claimed that the first circus games were staged by the goddess Circe in honor of her father Helios , the Sun God . The modern and commonly held idea of a ' circus ' is of a Big Top with various acts providing entertainment therein .</context>

      <context> Some containers such as tubs or jars now have a plastic film heat sealed onto the container : this is often called a <head>lidding</head> film . The word is used metaphorically , as in " keeping the lid on the secret " and " flipped his lid " . An old saying that you never have to put a lid on a bucket of crabs ( because when one gets near the top , another will inevitably pull it down ) is often used as a metaphor for group situations where an individual feels held back by others .</context>

      <context> The Orioles once_again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas_City pitchers . Three were doubles , Brooks_Robinson getting a pair and Marv_Breeding one . Bill_Kunkel , Bob_Hartman and Ed_Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West_Palm_Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami_Stadium . The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took_over in the <head>top</head> of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee_Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning appearance , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left .</context>

      <context> The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League_clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas_City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . Indications as_late_as the <head>top</head> of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory drought as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage . Over the first five frames , Jack_Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in_the_middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American_League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick_Hyde , submarine_ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock . A two run homer by Norm_Siebern and a solo_blast by Bill_Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts .</context>

The White_Sox had taken a 5 - 4 lead in the <head>top</head> of the sixth on a pair of pop_fly hits - a triple by Roy_Sievers and single by Camilo_Carreon - a walk and a sacrifice_fly . Jim_Landis ' 380 - foot home_run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1 - 0 lead , but Harmon_Killebrew came_back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob_Allison aboard . Al_Smith 's 340 - blast over left in the fourth - his fourth homer of the campaign - tied the score and Carreon 's first major_league home_run in the fifth put the Sox back in_front .

      <context> The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper_limit of the apparatus on_hand . The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular_weights which were stated to be 520 and 300 . These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular_weight . The maximum suction was 3.25 '' of test fluid measured from the <head>top</head> of the block , and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids . It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus .
