      <context> It is borne_out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next . It becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality . This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek speaking ones . They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and <head>history</head> . Death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience . It represents a punishment that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time . These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified .</context>

      <context> If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator . This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced . If death receives more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through Christ begins to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence . Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and <head>history</head> . Because Christianity teaches not_only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of Christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ .</context>

      <context> As represented by a spiral , history may , in_some_sense , be said to repeat itself ; yet each historical event remains unique . Christ is both unique and universal . The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam . As Origen interprets the end of <head>history</head> on the basis of its beginning , so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of Christ . `` Whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ? From God 's Will and Wisdom , and from virgin earth . For ' God had not rained ' , says the Scripture , before man was made , ' and there was no man to till the earth ' .</context>

      <context> The Eichmann case looked_to the past , not to the future . It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as_long_as there are Jews . As_such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message '' . `` It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial '' - said Ben_Gurion , `` and not the Nazi regime alone - but anti-Semitism throughout <head>history</head> '' . How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-Semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ? And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all_but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a `` fiend '' ? These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case .</context>

      <context> Many_of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful . With over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . With the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens . The attempt to enforce that belief ushered_in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our <head>history</head> . The so-called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end . That tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society . That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard_to birth_control today .</context>

      <context> Many_of his fellow officers refused to speak_to him . But when a board of inquiry was called to look_into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him . He was a member of The Fighting_Seventh . Although it was at the Battle_of_The_Little_Horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history , that the 7_th_Cavalry first made its mark in <head>history</head> , the regiment was ten years old by then . Brevet_Major_General_George_Armstrong_Custer was the regiment 's first permanent commander and , like such generals as George_S._Patton and Terry_de_la_Mesa_Allen in their rise to military prominence , Custer was a believer in blood_and_guts warfare . During the Civil_War , Custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier_general at the age of 23 . He finished the war as a major_general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major_general in the history of the U._S. Army .</context>

      <context> But he plunges into yet another , this time with Norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of_age when he died . He had become king at fifteen . Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling . From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the <head>history</head> of Sweden . This is brought_out in the next_to_last chapter of the book , `` A_Hero 's Funeral '' , written in the form of an impassioned prose_poem . Slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes_through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories . The guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors .</context>

      <context> Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory . Excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of The_Charles_Men , and need not detain us here . It is different with his volume The_Swedes_and_Their_Chieftains ( Svenskarna_och_deras_ho ^_vdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high_school students . Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish <head>history</head> for readers of other countries . Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background . These are suggestive_of Selma_Lagerlo ^ f . Especially touching is the chapter , `` The_Little_Sister '' , about a king 's daughter who became a nun in the convent of St._Birgitta .</context>

      <context> Henrietta 's feeling_of_identity with Sara_Sullam was crowned by her discovery of the coincidence that Sara 's epitaph in the Jewish cemetery in Venice referred to her as `` the Sulamite '' . Into the texture of this tapestry of <head>history</head> and human drama Henrietta , as every artist delights to do , wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and - especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair - into the relations of men and women : `` In their relations , she was the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander . His feeling always exacted sacrifices from her . One is so accustomed to think_of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and women as submissive and yielding , that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned , and we condemn the woman as a coquette . The very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts ; usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived_notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly .</context>

      <context> Again , Henley 's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self mastery is far from characteristic of a Stoic thinker like Marcus_Aurelius , whose gentle acquiescence is almost Christian , comparable_to the patience expressed in Milton 's sonnet on his own blindness . In recent years , we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts , although these aspects should be studied in_conjunction_with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the sciences . When these fields are surveyed together , important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact with the fine_arts and even , to some extent , with science . Here we may observe that at_least one modern philosophy of <head>history</head> is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian 's research . Let us quote once_more from R._G._Collingwood : `` History is properly concerned with the actions of human_beings . Regarded from the outside , an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world ; regarded from the inside , it is the carrying_into_action of a certain thought . The historian 's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them .</context>

      <context> Is there a question here for American foreign_policy , and , if so , what is it ? For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is - that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself , and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer . Chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind , he reaches a tentative identification of the question - tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because , if no tolerable answer can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered . Meanwhile he has been thinking_about the facts surrounding the problem , facts which he knows can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already been lost to <head>history</head> . He is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play , taking_care to examine at_least some of the raw_material which underlies their frequently policy oriented conclusions . He knows that he must give the expert his place , but he knows that he must also keep him in it . He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing .</context>

      <context> As I have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known_as the Buy American Act . I urge once_again that the Congress not reenact this rider . The task of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without endangering other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress . The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in <head>history</head> . Some weapons_systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development . Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon_system , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems . This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons_systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_systems which have been overtaken by events .</context>
