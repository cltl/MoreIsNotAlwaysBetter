Insofar as it is collaborative , a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would not otherwise be possible on an individual basis ; both individual and social ( common ) benefits can thus be distinguished , or in many cases found to overlap .</context>

The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him .</context>

      <context> If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . ) In a mobile <head>society</head> , congregational health depends_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like elements will have_to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation . In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per_cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' .

      <context> Operating as a one_man police_force in fact if not in_name , he is at_once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves . He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at_all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished . Thus the fictional detective is much more_than a simple businessman . He is , first_and_foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of <head>society</head> . It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts_for the great appeal of the mythological detective .

      <context> The birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal . Even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which give_rise to the mystery_story are not fully resolved . The individualism and public service of the private_detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code_of_conduct : he enforces the law without being told to do so . The private_eye is therefore a moral man ; but his morality rests upon that of his <head>society</head> . The basic premise of all mystery_stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal .

Faulkner 's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life . They have an ancestry extending back , however , at_least to 1728 , when William_Byrd described the Lubberlanders he encountered in the back_country of Virginia and North_Carolina .

      <context> Still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one 's ideas of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic_books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of_this influence . Probably the most important thing to focus_on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available . This is in large part a code_of_behavior and a glossary of values : what is it that people do and should do and_how one should regard it . In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of <head>society</head> and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint .

We should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities , state and provincial governments , rural communities , and other smaller groups , making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected . Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships of technical progress in various fields , showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education , how health affects labor productivity , how small business can benefit the rural farm community , and , above_all , how progress in each field relates to national progress . Efforts such_as the Community_Development_Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional <head>societies</head> can work toward balanced national development . To achieve this goal of balanced development , communications between the central government and the local communities must be such_that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken_into_account .

On this principle of division I must postpone the evolution of sculpture , architecture , <head>society</head> , and politics ; for the developments in these areas make_sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself . The growing contacts between Aegean and Orient are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of Hellenic culture after 750 . We shall not be able entirely to pass_over these connections to the East as we consider Ripe_Geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious evolution of early Greece ; the important point , however , is that these magnificent achievements , unlike those of later decades , were only incidentally influenced by Oriental models . The antecedents of Dipylon vases and of the Iliad lie_in the Aegean past .</context>

      <context> In More 's Utopia communism is not a means of separating_out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass . Utopian communism applies to all Utopians . And in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central . The concern of Utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu , the best ordering of a civil <head>society</head> ; and it is again_and_again made clear that Utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensable to that best ordering . To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors in spirit , the monastic communities , is with an appropriate shift of adjectives , misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato 's Republic : in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes , in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes . The apostolic community was literally an elite : chosen by Christ himself .</context>

      <context> And the monastic communities were supposed to be made_up of volunteers selected only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigors , their spiritual athleticism . Finally , the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More 's time , although it was not accepted by all the theologian philosophers of the Middle_Ages . In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the Fall of Man . It did not serve to contrast the existing order of <head>society</head> with a possible alternative order , because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had sinned . The actual function of patristic civilian canonist scholastic communism was adequately set_forth by St._Gregory almost a millennium before More wrote Utopia . `` The soil is common to all men . When we give the necessities of life to the poor , we restore to them what is already theirs .</context>

      <context> He is a trustee for the common good , however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund , wisely or unwisely , entrusted to his keeping . In_contrast_to this Stoic patristic view , Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely_on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve . The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions . In a properly ordered <head>society</head> the massive force of public_law performs the function which in natural_law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small_voice so often still . In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role . Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced . We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk_lore of the Greeks .</context>

      <context> But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials . Surely there is nothing new about communism . We find it in Plato 's republic , and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book . We find it in that `` common way_of_life pleasing to Christ and still in_use among the truest <head>societies</head> of Christians '' , that_is , the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity . We find it in the later Stoic conception of man 's natural condition which included the community of all possessions . This conception was taken_up by the early Church_Fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle_Ages ; and More was far too well_read not to have come_across it in one or several of the forms thus given it . But although the idea of communism is very old even in More 's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it is not communism as_such that we are concerned with .</context>

      <context> That 's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation . In the Middle_Ages , in the Renaissance , right up_to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world . He was an artisan , a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood_carver did . He filled a real need , showing <head>society</head> what it looked_like , turning it inside_out , portraying its wars and its leaders , its ugliness and its beauties , reflecting its profound religious impulses . He was a propagandist - they were n't afraid of the word , then - satirist , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party . But look_at us today !
