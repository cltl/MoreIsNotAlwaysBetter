      <context> Still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing . An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true . A century ago , Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English_Protestantism , and that even high_Anglicanism would someday no_longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own '' . That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant <head>country</head> '' . One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite . Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy . The London_Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping_out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one_hundred years .</context>

Intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief Shepherd , the vicar of thy Son '' . A hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is `` Faith_of_our_Fathers '' , which glories in England 's ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims : `` Faith of our Fathers : Mary 's prayers / Shall win our <head>country</head> back to thee '' . The English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty_Martyrs and Cardinal_Newman will soon be canonized . Because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , English Catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being `` English '' . I have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in_the_air .</context>

      <context> But it must be readily seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at_least on the Catholic side . For `` the_tide_is_well_on_the_turn '' , as the London_Catholic_weekly_Universe has written . I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal_Newman . As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated <head>country</head> . Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England . In representing part of this new picture , I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments ; but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican_Churches and about the present religious state of England . Since the Protestant clergy for_the_most_part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my Roman_collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman_Catholic cleric .</context>

      <context> That tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society . That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard_to birth_control today . Up_to the turn_of_the_century , contraception was condemned by all Christian_churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine_law . This was generally reflected in the civil_laws of Christian <head>countries</head> . Today , the Roman_Catholic and Orthodox_Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction . The various Lambeth_Conferences , expressing the Anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken_place among Protestants generally . In 1920 , the Lambeth_Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together_with the grave dangers - physical , moral , and religious - thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' .</context>

The general Protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' . An action once universally condemned by all Christian_churches and forbidden by the civil_law is now not_only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant_denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty . This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this <head>country</head> . Repeated polls have disclosed that most married_couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth_control . For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment .</context>

      <context> Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .

One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United_States in more recent years .

Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted . Most <head>countries</head> in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social_system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective .

For_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement .</context>

Furthermore , the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing <head>countries</head> are often of comparative value and essential to evaluating election results . The sine_qua_non of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure . As the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated_by either party could fairly administer elections . The P.D.I. and later the Popular_Movement protected the Istiqlal 's `` privileged position '' until the fall of Balafrej , and_then the Istiqlal used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the pro U.N.F.P. tendencies of the Ibrahim government .</context>

      <context> Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no_longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed . The old way of doing things , which depended_on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no_longer adequate_to the task . First was the period of codification of existing law : the Code_Napoleon in France and the peculiar codification that , in_fact , resulted from Austin 's restatement and ordering of the Common_Law in England . Codification was followed in all <head>countries</head> by a growing amount of legislation , some changing and adjusting the older law , much dealing with entirely new situations . The legislative mills have been grinding ever since , and when its cumbersome processes were no_longer adequate_to the task , a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another , to the executive . Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law . Indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific .</context>

      <context> The displacement ( at_least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international_law theory and doctrine . In_the_first_place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal_system . One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded_as the law_of_nations . Admiralty_law , the law_merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign <head>country</head> were all severed from the older Law_of_Nations and made dependent_on the several national laws . Private international_law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international_law proper , or , as it is often called , public international_law . States were free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , their own rules as_to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law_merchant , and to enact legislation with regard_to many claims arising on the high_seas . The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in_fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations .</context>

      <context> But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard_to most_of the rest of the world . Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere . Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin_America ( though limited in Latin_America by the special interest of the United_States as expressed in the Monroe_Doctrine , itself from the outset related_to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance_of_power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in_order to preserve both common economic_values and the European `` balance '' itself . A nation such_as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied_upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin_American <head>countries</head> ; out_of_the_question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa . This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19_th century scholars . More emphasis was put upon the fact that international_law was the law of `` civilized nations '' ; Kent and Story , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made_use_of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent . Wheaton stated that the public_law was essentially `` limited to the civilized and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European origin '' .</context>

      <context> Of_course it had always been of European origin in_fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural_law theory . Now , with virtually every writer , not_only was the European origin of public_law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others . The European customs on which international_law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states . Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed <head>countries</head> . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states .</context>
