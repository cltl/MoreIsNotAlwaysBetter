The vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a_thousand unexpected <head>guests</head> for lunch . Larkin has an answer to all that . The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas , for_example , will provide needed space for the extra television_sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids .

      <context> Television has yet to work_out a living_arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy <head>guest</head> than as a relaxed member of the family . There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago style jazz in prime evening time , for_example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary . At_least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' , presented on NBC - TV Nov. 26 . The program came_out of the NBC Special Projects department , and was slotted in the Du_Pont_Show of the Week series .</context>

      <context> To forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O_'_Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay . The reception was held in a private dining_room of the Webster_Hotel on Lincoln_Park_West . It was an interesting fraternisation of ex convicts , union racketeers , ward_heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen . The <head>guest</head> list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time . It included the top O_'_Banion men and Chief_of_Detectives_Michael_Hughes . When Mayor_Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police_department by consorting with these felons and fixers . Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry_O_'_Connor , the proprieter of a Loop gambling_house .</context>

On this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes .

The party is usually in a room small enough so that all <head>guests</head> are within sight and hearing of one another . The information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air_waves , and is received by the ears . Since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net . As shown in Figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points .</context>
