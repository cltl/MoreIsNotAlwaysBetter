      <context> A <head>shock</head> absorber ( in reality , a shock " damper " ) is a mechanical or hydraulic device designed to absorb and damp shock impulses . It does this by converting the kinetic energy of the shock into another form of energy ( typically heat ) which is then dissipated . Most shock absorbers are a form of dashpot .</context>

      <context> All_of these activities are geared to a top priority communication_system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly . Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence . On November 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka_Peninsula . At 17_:_07 that afternoon ( Greenwich_time ) the <head>shock</head> was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu . The warning system immediately went into action . Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake 's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude . While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came_in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military_services and the police that the first big wave would arrive_at Honolulu at 23_:_30 Greenwich_time .</context>

      <context> In a conditioning experiment , he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain . A mild electrical_shock served as a conditioned_stimulus and was followed by feeding . The pain became thus the symbol for food and elicited salivary secretion ( conditioned_reflex ) . Even when the intensity of the <head>shocks</head> was increased gradually , it failed to evoke any signs of pain . Since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation , Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding . Appropriate experiments showed that this is , indeed , possible . He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses .</context>
