      <context> Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman_Catholics '' , and have done so . While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population_shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going_to church . It should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics ( one paper writes 50 per_cent ) . Still , it is clear from such <head>reports</head> , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing . An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .

That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' .</context>

      <context> Thus , his estimate lies between Oliver 's suggestion of at_least 37 feet and the 50 - foot `` monstrous freaks '' intimated by Heuvelmans . The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern Colombia by Roberto_Lamon , a petroleum_geologist of the Richmond_Oil_Company , and reported in 1944 by Emmett_R_._Dunn . However , as a field measurement , it is open_to question . Oliver 's 37 - 1 2 feet is partly based on this <head>report</head> and can be accepted as probable . However , many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 feet . It is possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong_to subspecies limited to a small area . In snakes difference in size is a common characteristic of subspecies .</context>

      <context> When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing . Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easier than to the downtown department_store , though both are the same distance from home . Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown . Raymond_Vernon <head>reports</head> that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the lot next_door . If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened_away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program . And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble .</context>
