      <context> The Egyptian pound was subdivided into 100 qirush ( <head>Arabic</head> : قروش , singular qirsh , قرش , English : piastre ) . The qirsh used to be subdivided into 40 para , but decimalisation following the 1886 Egyptian currency reform established a 1/10 qirsh , which came to be known as a millim ( ملّيمات , singular : ملّيم ) . Due to this legacy , the post 1956 Sudanese pound was divided into 100 qirush , subdivided into 10 millims .</context>
