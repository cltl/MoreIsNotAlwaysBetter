      <context> It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . To do this , it is sufficient to point_out that if the <head>principle</head> in_terms_of which alternatives are to be conceived is such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question . Thus , if what is at_issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either case the judgment in_question is false . Hence , if what is in_question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a_little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded . Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on_the_one_hand , by the two at_least apparently self-consistent but mutually_exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on_the_other_hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann .</context>

They stick_to their <head>principles</head> , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it . Treat them right and they 'll make a showing every_month in the year except the frigid ones .

A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special .</context>

      <context> At the rear of the auditorium , upstairs , some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor . It would not give . A Dr._Charles_Taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to hoist him up to the box . In the audience a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob , on the same <head>principle</head> which had led Miss_Harris to demand water . Someone opened the corridor door from the inside , and called_for a doctor . Somehow Dr._Charles_Leale was forced through the mob and squeezed_out into the dingy corridor . He went straight to the Presidential box .</context>
