      <context> The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test_suit to test the validity of the act , and_then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway_Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural_Roads_Authority bonds for rural road construction work . The department apparently intends to make the Rural_Roads_Authority a revolving_fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid_off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a <head>battle</head> in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov._Marvin_Griffin . The Highway_Department source told The_Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds . Schley_County_Rep._B._D._Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body 's action of Friday in voting itself a $ 10 per day increase in expense allowances . Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought .</context>

      <context> If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic_system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? These proposals would go_far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual , who , in_turn , would help us to cope_with runaway technology . Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition . The <head>battle</head> is not easy . We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of_our_own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders . Persons developed in to-day 's corporations cannot hope to serve here - a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside . In my own company , in_effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , I have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal '' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do .</context>

      <context> Bravado has been alternately described as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of France and myself '' ( De_Gaulle ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob '' ! ( Norman_Mailer ) , but no one can deny that the screen crackles with electricity whenever he is on it . Soaring to stardom along with him , Margo_Felicity_Brighetti , a luscious and curvaceously beguiling Italian starlet , turns_in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic . The <head>battle</head> of the drib-drool continues , but most of New_York 's knowing sophisticates of Abstract_Expressionism are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation of V ( for Vindication ) Day , September first , when Augustus_Quasimodo 's first one-man show opens at the Guggenheim . We have heard that after seeing Mr._Quasimodo 's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . And it is thought by many who think_about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet , progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso , and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De_Kooning . Quasimodo defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' .</context>
