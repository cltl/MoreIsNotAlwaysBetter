The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders .

      <context> For_example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . Let us now put some flesh_on_the_theoretical_bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . One should keep in mind that many_of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas . The president of a small <head>firm</head> selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive - and the rate_of_attrition due_to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high . It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired - and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed . Roleplaying was offered as a solution - and the procedure worked as_follows : all candidates were invited to a hotel conference_room , where the president explained the difficulty he had , and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work_out .</context>

The president of the <head>firm</head> , calculating expenses alone , felt his costs had dropped one-half while success in selection had improved over one_hundred per_cent . The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers . They were , in_a_sense , `` tried_out '' in realistic situations . From the point_of_view of the applicants , less time was wasted in being evaluated - and they got a meal out of it as_well_as some insights into their performances .</context>

      <context> Similarly , higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase . This is not extended to anticipated levels of GNP , however - only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against wage price increases . Finally , since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call_for less_than proportionately larger price increases ( e._g. , if a wage increase of 5 % allows a price increase of 7 % , a wage increase of 10 % allows a price increase of something less_than 14 % ) . We assume that average total unit_cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with_respect_to quantity produced ( the average_cost curve is horizontal , and therefore is identical with the marginal_cost curve ) , and is the same for every <head>firm</head> ( and therefore for the industry ) . The level of this average_cost is determined by factor prices , technology , and_so_forth . As we have noted , however , we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate . The level of average_cost ( equal to marginal_cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate .</context>

      <context> For the purposes of setting the product price , the industry behaves as a single entity . In wage negotiations , the industry bargains as a unit with a single union .

In any given time_period , the aggregate demand for the industry 's product is determined by two things : the price charged by the industry , and the level of GNP .
