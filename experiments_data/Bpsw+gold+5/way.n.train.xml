Justice is a worthy objective ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union_of_South_Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer .

It may be , of_course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in_favor_of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of Soviet Communist power .

      <context> The socialism implicit_in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the First_Amendment to the Constitution , or of the Jacksonian frontier . What had happened to the common_man ? French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in_this country before the days of Popularism . The riotous onrush of industrialism after the War_for_Southern_Independence and the general secular drift to the Religion_of_Humanity , however , prepared the <head>way</head> for a reception of the French_Revolution 's socialistic offspring of one sort of another . The first of_which to find important place in our federal_government was the graduated income_tax under Wilson . Moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920 s , the dislocations of the Depression , the common ethos of Materialism everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced Mike_Fink and the Great_Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the Little_People . However , it is important to trace the philosophy of the French_Revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former .</context>

      <context> Faulkner 's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life . They have an ancestry extending back , however , at_least to 1728 , when William_Byrd described the Lubberlanders he encountered in the back_country of Virginia and North_Carolina . The chief literary antecedents of the Snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated_in the South and the Southwest in the three decades before the Civil_War . These narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their <head>way</head> between book covers , though rarely into the planters ' libraries beside the morocco bound volumes of Horace , Mr._Addison , Mr._Pope , and Sir_Walter_Scott . There is evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William_Gilmore_Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such_as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him . Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully .</context>
