During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone_calls . Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election . Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election .</context>

      <context> In New_York_City in 1958 , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive_device . He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman_Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy . A year later in Albany , N._Y. , a Roman_Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned_Parenthood_Association . Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry <head>dispute</head> over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious_belief and conscience . These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue . It has flared_up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family welfare agencies . It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries .</context>
