      <context> It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . THE DENVER-AREA TV_audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home_runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob_Howsam that the games are not to be blacked_out when his Bears are playing at_home . This rule providing_for a blackout of televised baseball 30_minutes before the start of a major or minor_league game in any area comes from the game 's top rulers . The last <head>couple</head> of years the Bears management got_the_business from the `` Living_Room_Athletic_Club '' when games were cut_off . Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy . This year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide_by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here . There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .</context>

      <context> But the thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him . Calmly he opened the Bible and read of the woman at the well .

The next morning , as the clock struck nine , he appeared at the Council meeting in the Town_Hall and insisted that the <head>couple</head> would have_to be punished if the Church was to be respected . `` I have told you before , and I tell you again '' , Monsieur_Favre said rudely . `` Stick_to the preaching of the Gospel '' ! John stiffened in anger .</context>

      <context> After_all , he had n't happened_upon us in_that second floor hall without warning . The ME 's boys had finished their on-the-spot examination and the body had been removed for autopsy . The meat wagon , therefore , was not out in_front of the house any_more , but the cluster of squad_cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings . There was , furthermore , the crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a <head>couple</head> more cops to hold them at a decent distance .

      <context> Casey watched them go , still frowning absently and_then dismissing the matter as he called_for his check . As he went_out he told Freddie the dinner was perfect , and when he got his hat and coat from Nancy_Parks and put a fifty-piece_piece in the slot , he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry . A taxi took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car , and a_few minutes later he found a parking_place across the street from his apartment . Because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past <head>couple</head> of hours , he did not think to look and see if Jerry_Burton 's car was still there . In_fact , he did not think_about Jerry_Burton at_all until he entered his living_room and closed the door behind him . Only then , when his glance focused_on the divan and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem . Even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread_over Burton , the pillow , the sheet_of_paper on top of it .</context>

      <context> Even in the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still disappearing . For less_than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on - a blatant and defiant rustler named Fred_Powell . `` Fred was mighty crude about the way he took_in cattle '' his own hired_man , Andy_Ross , mentioned later . `` Everyone knew it , but he sort_of acted like he did n't care who knew it - even after them notes came , even after he 'd heard about Lewis , even after he 'd been shot at a <head>couple</head> o ' times hisself '' ! On the morning of September 10 , 1895 , Powell and Ross rose at dawn and began their day 's work . Haying_time was close at_hand , and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack . Harnessing a team to a buckboard , they drove out to a willow lined creek about a half-mile off , then climbed_down and began chopping .</context>
