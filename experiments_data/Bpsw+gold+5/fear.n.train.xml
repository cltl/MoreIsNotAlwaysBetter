      <context> The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of_this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . In regard_to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of_this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through <head>fear</head> of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light_mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it .

      <context> In_fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day_by_day increasing our fear of each other . I want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear .

      <context> While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United_States since World_War_2 , . Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here presented . The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price_competition , but which is so basic that its wage price policies are held in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to <head>fears</head> of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . In_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells_out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages .</context>

      <context> The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of GNP . The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest . Because of its importance , and because the lack of price_competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases . The threat of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and <head>fears</head> of endangering relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases . For the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry limited price ( but not below average_cost ) . For such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs ( due_to rising wages , etc . ) . Thus , if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate .</context>

      <context> The pace could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood_on_firm_ground . The landscape of Greek history broadens widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century B.C. , the age of Homer 's `` rosy fingered Dawn '' . The first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world ; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change . For this period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; the ceramic material of the age is more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative_of the hopes and <head>fears</head> of its makers , who begin to show scenes of human life and death . Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece ; objects in gold , ivory , and bronze grow more numerous . Since writing was practiced in the Aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful . Though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the Iliad to any specific era , this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by 750 .</context>

He could throw himself on the mercy of the Police_Department . It was n't what Mae would want him to do , though . He was sure of this .</context>

      <context> He climbed , as quickly as he could urge his body , up the two unbroken flights to the third floor , pulling himself along on a delicate balustrade , all that remained of the building 's beauty . He paused on the landing to steady his breathing and_then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead . Now he was certain : the lock had not yielded to Muller 's collection of keys ; fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open . It had been shut again , but the lock was broken ; he noted with a thrill of <head>fear</head> that the door moved under his touch . What was he to do now ? He had thought no further than finding Muller . He realized now he had more_than half hoped he would n't find him - that Muller would not be here , that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond Hoag 's control .</context>

      <context> Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished . He , McBride , would be cited as in the wrong , and he , Lord , would go scot-free , an officer who had only done his duty , though perhaps too energetically . McBride staggered into the street , flopped sprawling in the stinging dust . <head>Fear</head> maddened , fleeing the lengthening shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again . He could n't see ; he was long past the point of coherent thinking . Dimly , he heard laughter , hoots of derision , but he could not read the racket properly . He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago , and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air .</context>

      <context> The cloudburst cut_off abruptly . They were engulfed by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry murmur of the river . Then the darkness thinned , and there was light again , and_then bright sunlight . Beaten with <head>fear</head> and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the hurricane_deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills . The water_level was higher than their hubs . Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored . There was no real sign of the river now , just a roiling , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere .</context>

      <context> Did the Old_Man remember them there ? Yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square_blocks - like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery . Only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences , where one man 's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy . Love and hatred and <head>fear</head> were one here , shaded only by fig_trees and grape_vines . And the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back_porch to back_porch . The Old_Man silently fed_upon these streets . They kept him alive , waiting .</context>

      <context> Wilson , shackled and snarling , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by Green , McKee and McKinley . Not a man on the brig , loyal or villainous , could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny . In the tiny cabin , Alexander met with Gansevoort , Heiser and Wales to speak and to listen . Three days had passed since Spencer 's arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new <head>fears</head> . Gansevoort said , `` It requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely . To have the Greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed . From actions aboard , it is easy to guess that Spencer 's boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate '' .</context>

      <context> `` She really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed . Her upper lip lifted slightly . She was biting into a small red radish ; and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing . Also , she lived in continual <head>fear</head> of finding a white worm curled_up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish . She would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting . It never worked , naturally ; but it made her look unusual . Also , when she had bitten_off half of the small radish , she found the suspense unbearable ; and she would snatch the finger held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it .</context>
