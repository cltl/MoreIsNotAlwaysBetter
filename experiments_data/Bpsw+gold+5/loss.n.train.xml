      <context> If the Orioles are to break their losing_streak within the next two days , it will have to be at_the_expense_of the American_League champion New_York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night_game and a single test Sunday afternoon . The flavor of Baltimore 's Florida_Grapefruit_League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron_Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army 's military training_program and is ready for belated spring_training . Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove_in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average , completes the Birds ' spring squad at 49 players . The big , 22 - year old shortstop , the 1960 American_league `` rookie of the year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $ 15000 and was a spectator at tonight 's 5 - to 3 <head>loss</head> to Kansas_City - the winless Birds ' sixth setback in_a_row . The 6 - foot 3 inch Hansen checked_in close_to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting_weight last spring . He hopes to melt_off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks_camp three weeks hence . When he was inducted into the Army at Fort_Knox_, Ky. , Hansen 's weight had dropped to 180 - `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said .</context>

Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such_as the coastal lowlands centering_on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West_Indies than with the North even after independence .

Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind .

The biggest <head>loss</head> , of_course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy .

      <context> If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about * * f km of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic_energy less than their potential_energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . De_Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more_and_more eccentric without changing the semi major_axis . This effect can give_rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth . Since there is a continual <head>loss</head> of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary_space .

      <context> Furthermore , conditioned_reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level , and several types of behavioral changes probably related_to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observed . If , for_instance , such a change is produced by one or a_few insulin comas or electroshocks , previously inhibited conditioned_reactions reappear . However , if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished . In other studies , <head>loss</head> of differentiation in previously established conditioned_reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatments , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes . It has further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ( 2 ) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned_reactions ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned_stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned_reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing ( alerting ) effect on the EEG . These are few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned_reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes . The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion .</context>
