Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in_that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) . But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel 's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each <head>student</head> 's approach as distinctly his own . Schnabel 's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one .

This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .</context>

      <context> Not_only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent_to certification to teach the subject . Participation for the educator in this case , however , would have_to be raised to full and complete membership . The largest of these organizations at_present denies to the full_time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog . This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the <head>students</head> . The professor in_turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice . This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands . In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools .</context>

      <context> Nor will the hack , the Jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art_schools , suffice . Only a_few years ago a middle_western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior_design . At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art '' . This kind of irresponsibility toward their <head>students</head> can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer . We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior_design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take_on the usual accompaniments of teaching - minimal income and minimal status among their confreres . Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such_as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable . In all `` degree '' courses in interior_design a number of `` academic '' or `` general studies '' courses are included .</context>

      <context> The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only_if this standard is observed .

For proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at_least one level above that for which the <head>student</head> is a candidate . Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior_design this rule cannot at_present be observed . Indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at_all . The question , however , cannot be ignored for long .</context>

      <context> It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior_designer 's training . We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior_design <head>student</head> as not having serious bearing on the subject . The real question that follows is - how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? The American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course . An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior_design , for_the_most_part schools accredited by membership in the National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art , and a further `` on_the_spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations .</context>

      <context> The old established independent art_schools try their best to fulfill their obligations . Yet even here many_a problem is presented ; as in a recent design competition with a floor_plan and the simple command - `` design a luxury apartment '' ; no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical_area or local social necessities - simply `` a luxury apartment '' . Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show_pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public_relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior_design . It is possible , of_course , to work_on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so_that the <head>student</head> may get `` the feel '' of real interior_design demands . Unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule . It is like medical_schools in India where , in that fairy_land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead_bodies is frowned_upon .

      <context> That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant . As_long_as his material is Americana , can in_some_way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied . From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth century American folklore . On the one side we have the university professors and their <head>students</head> , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought_out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make_up this nation . On the other we have the flag_wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways . After_all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates .</context>

If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public . And while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested <head>student</head> will want to ask himself a number of questions about each . Does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall_tale and a true product of the folk ? When the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ? Is the writer propagandistic ?</context>

      <context> It is at_least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break_down barriers of inequality in the South . I should_like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect_to vocational education . First_and_foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic_program for graduation . Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more_than half the <head>student</head> 's time in those years ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought_to begin earlier . Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality . This last point is important because if high_school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational_program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .</context>

The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat <head>students</head> sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee .
