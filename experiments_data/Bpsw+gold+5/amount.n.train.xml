      <context> Very little in today 's living provides the strength we need , and nothing provides the flexibility . Dancers do have flexibility . They often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength . Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the <head>amount</head> of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing . Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas . This is n't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11 - year old boys in America cannot chin themselves once , and that English school_girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) . The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw .</context>

      <context> This can be done by stories in your house_organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers ' homes as_well_as by_word_of_mouth through your chain of command . Some companies find a little imagination helpful . Hallmark_Cards_,_Inc. , Kansas_City , Mo. , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` Benefit_Bafflers '' , which it distributes to employees . M_+_R_Dietetic_Laboratories_,_Inc. , Columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook - each check showing the <head>amount</head> the company spends on a particular fringe . U._S._Rubber_Company , New_York , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits . The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for_example , costs $ 227.72 . Have the insurance_company or your own accounting department break_down the cost of your insurance package periodically .</context>

      <context> The check had been mailed from Chicago , the envelope bore no return_address , and the check was not signed . `` That 's Johnny '' , sighed the bank president , `` the best hearted boy in the world , but absent-minded '' . But Mercer 's explanation was simple : `` I made_out the check and carried it around a_few days unsigned - in_case I lost it '' . When he remembered that he might have not signed the check , Mercer made_out another for the same <head>amount</head> , instructing the bank to destroy the other - especially if he had happened_to have absent-mindedly signed both of them . When the family business failed , Mercer left school and on his mother 's urging - for she hoped that he would become an actor - he joined a local little theater group . When the troupe traveled_to New_York to participate in a one act play competition - and won - Mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in New_York . He had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah .</context>

      <context> The following table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , appropriations , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching_funds for this part of the grant program . In_order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational_rehabilitation services , Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on ( 1 ) need , as measured by a State 's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measured by its per_capita income . The Act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State . It stipulates , in_addition , that all <head>amounts</head> remaining as_a_result_of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums . These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per_capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State . The provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in State programs already in_operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone .

      <context> In 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at $ 18.9 billion , compared to $ 19.3 billion in 1960 . The decreases , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such_as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic_devices . Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 . New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement ( excluding <head>amounts</head> for related research and construction ) totals $ 4753 million , which is $ 1390 million below that enacted for 1960 . On_the_other_hand , the new authority of $ 3825 million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is $ 581 million higher than for 1960 . These contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed_Forces in the years ahead . The Department_of_Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items .</context>

The face of one block contained a hole 1 16 '' in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure . Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types . Two of the fluids showed a high positive normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in_comparison_with the <head>amount</head> of the positive pressures generated by the other two . Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure . Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built_up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate . A system had_to be used which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time .</context>

      <context> The market today for detergent_builders is quite diverse . The best_known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up_to 50 % by weight of sodium_tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium_tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium_pyrophosphate . In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same <head>amount</head> of phosphate builder ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; and the dwindling built soap_powders as_well_as soap_flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . A well publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid_detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder / active ratio . Hard surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork . The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders .</context>

      <context> ( 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80 . ( 3 ) For anionics , these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups ( the ionized ends ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase . Obviously hydrophobic ( oleophilic ) substances such_as greases , oils , or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at_home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase . Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable <head>amount</head> of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as_much_as approximately two-fold . Although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated , the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process . Related_to micelle formation is the technologically important ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil_water_interfaces in such a manner that the polar ( or ionized ) end of the molecule is directed towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase . In the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant .</context>

      <context> Large_numbers of potential builders have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in_practice . The problems of hard surface cleaning are not nearly as complex . In hard surface cleaning , the inorganic salts are more important than the organic active . Indeed , when the proper inorganic constituents are employed , practically any wetting or surface-active_agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient <head>amount</head> in a hard surface cleaning formulation . Hydroxides , orthophosphates , borates , carbonates , and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hard surface cleaners . In_addition , the polyphosphates are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else . The importance of the inorganic constituents in hard surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers .</context>

      <context> However , this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung . The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues . Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , ' 13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , ' 58 ) . Therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial_artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased <head>amount</head> of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus . If this be true , the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial_arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema . One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1 , or 2 , . The presence of normally occurring bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch , and thereafter by many others .</context>
