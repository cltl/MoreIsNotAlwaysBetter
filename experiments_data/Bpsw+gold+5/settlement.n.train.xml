      <context> As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota , Dousman of Michilimackinac , Michigan , and Prairie_du_Chien was traveling_to Red_River to open a trade in merchandise . Early in 1822 he was at Fort_Garry offering to bring_in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco . Alexander_McDonnell , governor of Red_River , and James_Bird , a chief factor of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , ordered such `` sundry articles '' to a value of 4500 . For its part the Hudson's_Bay_Company was troubled by the approach of American <head>settlement</head> . As the time drew_near for the drawing of the British American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the Pembina_colony - its own post and Fort_Daer - was on American territory . Accordingly Selkirk 's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by October , John_Halkett had torn_down both posts , floating the timber to `` the Forks '' in rafts . `` I have done everything '' , he wrote , `` to break_up the whole of that unfortunate establishment '' .</context>

      <context> Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , he purchased great blocks of the Company's stock with the view to controlling its policies . Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116000 square_miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . The grant , which stretched southward to Lake_Traverse - the headwaters of the Red - was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York_Factory on Hudson_Bay . Thus at the same time that William_Henry_Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana_Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon <head>settlement</head> made a great leap into the center of the North_American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier .

By October the little colony about Fort_Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 .
