      <context> For we have said , in_effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative . If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' is clearly untenable . Whereas Bultmann 's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl_Barth , involves the rejection or at_least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered . It follows , then , provided the <head>possibilities</head> have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . To do this , it is sufficient to point_out that if the principle in_terms_of which alternatives are to be conceived is such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question .</context>

      <context> I speak_of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved - ever - reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human_beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around . These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism . This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in_practice , antithetical to these conditions ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization . Moreover , as Communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro_rata and the <head>possibility</head> of their restoration becomes increasingly remote . It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant , proximate goal of American policy .

      <context> Observations of the radio_emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to_a_greater_extent than those using shorter wave_lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . Radio_observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . The observed intensity of the radio_emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave_lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black_body at about 600 ` K . This result suggests a very high_temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the <head>possibility</head> that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black_body merely by coincidence . For the case of Jupiter , the radio_emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non thermal components . Of the remaining planets , only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio_sources , and not very much information is available . Mars has been observed twice at about 3 - cm wave_length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars .</context>

In their book American_Skyline , Christopher_Tunnard and Henry_Hope_Reed argue that Franklin_Roosevelt 's New_Deal was what made the modern suburb a <head>possibility</head> - a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote . The first superhighways - New_York 's Henry_Hudson and Chicago 's Lake_Shore , San_Francisco 's Bay_Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania_Turnpike - were built as part of the federal works_program which was going_to cure the depression . At_the_same_time , Roosevelt 's Federal_Housing_Administration , coupled with Henry_Morgenthau 's cheap-money policy , permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes . Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U._S. government ; householders who had been unable to pick_up the burden of short-term high interest mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per_cent , under government aegis .</context>
