      <context> The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association . Since SAAMI 's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone_into the development of more places to_shoot for more youths and adults . We trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment . Are you getting top dollar from the shooting <head>sports</head> ? Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls , who will grow_up to enjoy a traditional American way_of_life - ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting_preserves ?</context>

      <context> The group known_as the American_Association_for_Health_,_Physical_Education_,_and_Recreation ( a division of the National_Education_Association ) initiated a conference which brought_together representatives of the National_Rifle_Association , SAAMI and the American_Fishing_Tackle_Manufacturers . This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known_as the Outdoor_Education_Project . The Outdoor_Education_Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life . The various team <head>sports</head> assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education .</context>

      <context> SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach . In 1959 SAAMI 's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting <head>sports</head> . This program is now nationally known_as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' . Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied_Merchandising_Corporation . The first program was sponsored by Abraham_+_Strauss , Hempstead , New_York , under the direction of Special Events director Jennings_Dennis .</context>

      <context> Modern_times have changed the world beyond recognition . The early years of the twentieth century seem very far_away . But with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain - a_few things remain constant , including the devotion of Americans to the great field_sports , hunting and fishing . As the generations move_on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor <head>sports</head> . Sporting firearms change , markedly for the better . Just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered_wagon , the demand of today 's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment . The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle_loader and slow firing single shot arms with modern fast firing autoloaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide_action firearms .</context>
