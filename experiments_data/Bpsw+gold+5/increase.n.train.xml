      <context> These were located at the homes of Government employees , in Government_Offices , buildings and reservations within the trial area . A rough attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first , ninth , and fifteenth floors of a Government_office building . All samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours . In this instance , there was a dosage of 562 during the first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four hour period , a four-fold <head>increase</head> . This suggests that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant locations , should have been increased . As can be seen from Figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this aerosol . The maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source .</context>

      <context> The African rock_python , a close second , is followed in_turn by the reticulate python . There are few data on the boa_constrictor , those for the anaconda are unconvincing , and there is nothing at_all on the amethystine_python . It seems likely that the Indian_python comes_out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently ; it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep . I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; at_best the annual <head>increase</head> appears to be a matter of inches rather_than feet . Until better records have been kept over longer periods_of_time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions , it will be wise to refrain_from drawing conclusions . It is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity , but this apparently is an overestimation . The best way to determine the correct figure ( in captives ) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth , a method that produced surprising results : maturing of a male Indian_python in less_than two years , his mate in less_than three ; data on the boa_constrictor about match this .</context>

      <context> Some vocational training_schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes_Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home_economics . Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . The George-Barden_Act of 1946 raised the previous <head>increases</head> in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in_addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith_Act . The Health_Amendment_Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical_nurse training . The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National_Defense_Education_Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden_Act . Annual authorizations of $ 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians .</context>
