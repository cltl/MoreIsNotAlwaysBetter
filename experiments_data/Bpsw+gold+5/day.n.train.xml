Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left . With Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host 's fertile but disorganized mind .</context>

      <context> At the outset , the Government 's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government and for du_Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court . Du_Pont , he said , had proposed disenfranchisement of its General_Motors stock along with other restrictions on the du_Pont-General_Motors relationship . The Government , deeming these suggestions inadequate , had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du_Pont 's shares of General_Motors . Counsel for the Government invited du_Pont 's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if counsel for du_Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable , the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty <head>days</head> . Counsel for du_Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by both sides at an early date . No previous antitrust_case , he said , had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief . The submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract .</context>

      <context> The variation in the 3 - cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very_much less_than the variation in the 8.6 - mm emission , as would be expected from the explanation of Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) . In the discussion which follows , the time average of the radio_emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component . The 10.3 - cm observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20 , 1958 , using the 84 - foot reflector at the Maryland_Point_Observatory of the U.S._Naval_Research_Laboratory . The age of the moon was about 2 <head>days</head> . The half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about 18 ' .5 , and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a Gaussian_shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon .</context>

      <context> In_spite of this , the very large radio_reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio_emission of most of the planets in a_few years . The study of the radio_emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25 - cm wave_length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 ) . This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25 - cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) . They deduced from their measurements that the radio_emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less_than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared_emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio_emission came about 3 - 1 2 <head>days</head> after Full_Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared_emission , which reaches its maximum at Full_Moon . Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing_out that rocklike materials which are likely to make_up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio_waves , although opaque to infrared_radiation . The infrared_emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due_to solar_radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase . Since the absorption of radio_waves in rocklike material varies with wave_length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material .</context>

      <context> The development of the Andrena larvae is very rapid , so that by the end of spring they have already pupated and become adults . But they are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter . Their appearance , next spring , coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants . In the Sacramento valley in California , for_instance , it has been observed that there was not one <head>day</head> 's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins . This must be_due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal . After the male and female andrenas have mated , the cycle is repeated . Although Andrena is gregarious , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together , we must still call it a solitary bee .</context>

      <context> There it seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen , which is then secreted in the milk . Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid_gland . In the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia , hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity ( Money , Rall and Rawson , 1952 ; Stanbury , Brownell , Riggs , Perinetti , Itoiz , and Del_Castillo , 1954 ) . In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre is about 100 | mg per <head>day</head> . With lower levels , thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine . Further , the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction of the thyroid_hormone de-iodinated peripherally . In the presence of a low iodine intake , thyroglobulin labelled in_vivo with * * f is found to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal , the amounts of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced .</context>

Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome . I have found , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior .

Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met . This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard_to the wishes of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy_chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair - in_short , behaving as if I owned her room .</context>

Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; even houses changed once a decade ; six hours of manual_labor a <head>day</head> for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; no private_property , no money ; no sort of pricing at_all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term .

It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that informs those details .

      <context> Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ_Church and Regius_Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance_English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . But to return to the main line of our inquiry . It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these <head>days</head> many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr . Utopia is still widely read because in_a_sense More stood on the margin of modernity . And if he did stand on the margins of modernity , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom . It was not even in writing Latin epigrams , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics , or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus 's philological study of the New_Testament .</context>

This conception was taken_up by the early Church_Fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle_Ages ; and More was far too well_read not to have come_across it in one or several of the forms thus given it . But although the idea of communism is very old even in More 's <head>day</head> and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it is not communism as_such that we are concerned with . We are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus : Platonic , Stoic , early Christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism ; we are concerned with Utopian communism - that_is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia , as More conceived it .

      <context> Ever since Bambi , and , more recently , Born_Free , there have been a_lot of books about animals , but few compare with Max_Fink 's wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable My_Friend_, the Quizzical_Salamander . Done in the modern style of a `` confession '' , Fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother 's pet salamander , Alicia . It is not an entirely happy book , as Mrs._Fink soon becomes jealous of Alicia and , in retaliation , refuses to continue to scrape the algae off her glass . Max , in a fit of despair , takes Alicia and runs_off for two marvelous weeks in Burbank ( Fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen <head>days</head> in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which Alicia tragically contracts Parkinson's_disease and dies . This brief resume hardly does the book justice , but I heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major problems of our time .
