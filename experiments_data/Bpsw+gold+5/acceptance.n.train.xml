      <context> A <head>banker</head> 's acceptance , or BA , is a promised future payment , or time draft , which is accepted and guaranteed by a bank and drawn on a deposit at the bank . The banker 's acceptance specifies the amount of money , the date , and the person to which the payment is due . After acceptance , the draft becomes an unconditional liability of the bank .</context>

      <context> Banker 's acceptances make a transaction between two parties who <head>do</head> not know each other safer , because they allow the parties to substitute the bank 's credit worthiness for that who owes the payment . They are used widely in international trade for payments that are due for a future shipment of goods and services . For example , an importer may draft a banker 's acceptance when it does not have a close relationship with and can not obtain credit from an exporter .</context>

      <context> Freed soil must be dispersed and protected against flocculation . Cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil . It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe . Upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process , it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having `` synergistic '' properties has gained widespread <head>acceptance</head> . In the over-all process , it is difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each constituent of a built detergent formulation ; and , indeed , there is no_more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active , builder , antiredeposition agent , etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making_up a given commercial organic active .</context>

      <context> To do so , he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in_detail . In the process , he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult . A_few of his examples are of very great interest , and the whole discussion of some importance for theory . His orthographic recommendations are no simplistic <head>acceptance</head> of phonemics on_the_one_hand or of superficiality on the other . Rather he weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness . He concludes that some changes can made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness , but hesitates to suggest precise graphic devices to effect these changes . I hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu circles .</context>

      <context> Now , with virtually every writer , not_only was the European origin of public_law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others . The European customs on which international_law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states . Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed countries . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an <head>acceptance</head> of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain .</context>

      <context> Afraid at one_and_the_same time that his work might be turned_down - which would be a blow to his pride even_though no_one knew he was the author - and that the work would be accepted , and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in_spite_of himself . And how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause ! And thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity , Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks . All these emotions were screwed_up to new heights when , after <head>acceptance</head> and the first rehearsals , there ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian music_lovers that Duclos had_to come running to Rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the King 's amusements , and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of Fontainebleau . Imagine the honor of_it ! `` What was your answer '' ? Jean_Jacques asked , striving to appear unimpressed .</context>
