      <context> In_this third year at the university , Hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` Limits_of_Poetry_and_Prose '' . He completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor_of_Philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine . He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices . Han 's student days were at_a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong <head>wave</head> of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent . The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in_charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university . He was stirred by the announcement of Volta 's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic_pile to experiments with acids and alkalis . The following year he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr '' , traveling in Germany , France , and the_Netherlands , meeting the philosophers Schelling , Fichte , and Tieck .</context>

      <context> The primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impressed us . What one actually remembers is its greenness . From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible . One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking <head>wave</head> of flower . Every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit_trees . In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet_shrub , snowball , rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead . From above one could only occasionally catch_a_glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block .</context>

      <context> one cannot assume , of_course , that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later_on when the stereotype was uttered ; probably it is correct to think_of it as a matter of a well grooved , stereotyped mode of expression - and no , or but a_few , other communicational grooves , as_yet - being there , available for the patient 's use , as newly emerging emotions and ideas well_up in him over the course of months . But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at_work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another . Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype - a `` How are you now '' ? or an `` I want to go_home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning . A hebephrenic man used_to give a repetitious <head>wave</head> of his hand a number of times during his largely silent hours with his therapist . When the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` What is that , Bill - hello or farewell '' ? , the patient replied , `` Both , Dearie - two in one '' . Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression , that which seems best to give release , and communicational expression , to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter .</context>

I bobbed my head each time it appeared . Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son_of_a_bitch '' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer_bottle into Johnson 's quivering ribs . A big car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning .</context>
