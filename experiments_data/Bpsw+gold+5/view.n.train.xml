      <context> Not_only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as_well was this true . Demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual_beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars . In such a world the words `` matter '' and `` spirit '' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all . In it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical <head>view</head> of reality in_general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously . The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit_world of the entities which previously populated it . In carrying_out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit . The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support .</context>

      <context> Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time . When , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality . In doing so science has unquestionably cleared_up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions . There have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific <head>view</head> of the world for which we may be rightly grateful . All this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing . The scientific debunking of the spirit_world has been in_a_way too successful and too thorough . The house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means , or at_best with wholly inadequate means , for dealing with his experience of spirit .</context>

      <context> If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator . This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced . If death receives more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through Christ begins to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence . Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian <head>view</head> of creation ; for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history . Because Christianity teaches not_only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of Christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ .</context>

      <context> The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them . Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions . When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep . If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from <head>views</head> of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real_life . Dr._H._V._Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University_of_Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification . As_a_matter_of_fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr._Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day . Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest 's information .</context>

The attempt to enforce that belief ushered_in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history . The so-called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end .

      <context> Today , the Roman_Catholic and Orthodox_Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction . The various Lambeth_Conferences , expressing the Anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken_place among Protestants generally . In 1920 , the Lambeth_Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together_with the grave dangers - physical , moral , and religious - thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' . Denouncing the <head>view</head> that the sexual_union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded_as the governing considerations of Christian marriage . One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . The Conference called_for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives . In 1930 , the Lambeth_Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate .</context>

      <context> These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some working for one 's good , others threatening ill .

The principal defender of this <head>view</head> of primary experience as `` causal efficacy '' is Alfred_North_Whitehead . Our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future .

In the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for_example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiments or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy_life regarded_as forbidden , or by half conscious ideas about the magical_power of words ?

There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister_of_the_Interior took the most pessimistic <head>view</head> and that the Istiqlal was something less_than enthusiastic . Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the_French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious . From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government . Until the Charter_of_Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes .</context>

      <context> Programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business_leaders demand it . Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in_sight and requests it .

If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states .

      <context> Man , through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny . The theory did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a Hegelian mystique . It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government . It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wished to minimize subjective <head>views</head> of officials who wielded public authority . Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society . To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative_officials and judges - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with .

      <context> It is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in_terms_of contract . In_fact , some - Anzilotti is the principle example - went so far as to say that all international_law could be traced to the single legal norm , Pacta sunt Servanda . The displacement ( at_least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international_law theory and doctrine . In_the_first_place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , rejecting the earlier <head>view</head> that both were parts of a universal legal_system . One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded_as the law_of_nations . Admiralty_law , the law_merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law_of_Nations and made dependent_on the several national laws . Private international_law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international_law proper , or , as it is often called , public international_law .</context>

      <context> The European customs on which international_law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states . Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed countries . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these <head>views</head> were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system .</context>

Now on the subjectivist <head>view</head> , this answer is ruled_out . For before someone takes_up an attitude toward death , suffering , or their infliction , they have no moral quality at_all .

      <context> Because community not severalty of property is the law_of_nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his . Indeed , of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a custodian .

In_contrast_to this Stoic patristic <head>view</head> , Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely_on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve .

      <context> More believed that a man could be both serious and gay . That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all_too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of . Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ_Church and Regius_Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar <head>view</head> , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance_English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . But to return to the main line of our inquiry . It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr .

It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' .
