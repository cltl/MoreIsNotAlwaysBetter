      <context> The situation in which we find ourselves is brought_out with dramatic force in Arthur_Miller 's play The_Crucible , which deals with the Salem witch trials . As the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of Salem in Puritan America at the end of the eighteenth century . Aside_from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community . The conversation of the characters creates an <head>atmosphere</head> suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age . There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people . Instead , the audience can sit_back at_ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no_longer believes_in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion . A teenage girl , Abigail_Williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the Reverend_Samuel_Parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings .</context>

In analyzing the watercolors of Roy_Mason , the first thing that comes_to_mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of <head>atmosphere</head> and climate . Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; a middle_distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey .</context>

      <context> It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries . Where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment . The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation . The first_step toward the goal is the establishment of a new <head>atmosphere</head> of mutual good_will and friendly communication on other_than the polemical level . Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached . `` All_too frequently '' , points_out James_O'_Gara , managing_editor of Commonweal , `` Catholics run_roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth_control has changed in recent decades '' . All_too often our language is unduly harsh .</context>

      <context> Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties .

Motion-picture exhibitions took_place in stores in a general <head>atmosphere</head> like that of the penny_arcade which can still be found in such urban_areas as Times_Square . Brief snips of actual events were shown : parades , dances , street scenes . The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity : a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats .</context>

      <context> This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement . Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism . I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North . In business circles , usually conservative , this sort of <head>atmosphere</head> would hardly be found . But in our case - and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts - the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come_close to wrecking several more . In_fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down . Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up_against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .</context>

      <context> The curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees . Opposite every gate was a hitching_post or a stone carriage step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse . The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center ; it was mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping_stones . It had a bucolic <head>atmosphere</head> that it has lost long_since . The hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses . Cows were kept in backyard barns , boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , were the boys ' coaxing voices , the thud of hooves , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide .</context>

      <context> Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship .

If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic_system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? These proposals would go_far toward creating the economic <head>atmosphere</head> favoring growth of the individual , who , in_turn , would help us to cope_with runaway technology . Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition . The battle is not easy .

      <context> A comedy in Three Acts '' , in which , under `` Personages '' , Henrietta appeared as `` A Schoolmarm '' , and Bertha , who was only a_trifle less brilliant in high_school than Henrietta had been , appeared as `` Dummkopf '' . Sadie studied piano ; played Chopin in the `` Soiree_Musicale of Mr._Guthrie 's Pupils '' ; and she recited `` Hector 's_Farewell_to_Andromache '' most movingly , to the special delight of Rabbi_Jastrow at his home in Germantown near Philadelphia , where the Szold girls took_turns visiting between the visits of the Jastrow boys at the Szolds ' in Baltimore . Adele , like Amy , the youngest of the Marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one . For Rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls - and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones - there was no particular March counterpart ; but both groups were so closely_knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in <head>atmosphere</head> if not entirely in content - the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian . The Szolds , like the Marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ; and , as in the March home , any young_man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them . This included Mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell_in_love , just as Papa had first fallen_in_love with her Mamma before he chose her ; and when a young_man like Morris_Jastrow had enjoyed the Szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold girls and Mamma . And just as `` Laurie '' Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo_March , who found him immature by her high standards , and_then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy , so Joe_Jastrow , who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns_Hopkins , had_to content himself with her younger sister , pretty Rachel .</context>

      <context> But the Latin_American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American_Defense_Board . For years the United_States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro 's representative from secret military talks . But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job . There is a new <head>atmosphere</head> of urgency in Washington this week . You can see it , for_example , in the extensive efforts President_Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by_the_way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past . What the next move will be only time , of_course , will tell . Personally , I think we ought to set_up an immediate naval_blockade of Cuba .</context>

      <context> It has recently become practical to use the radio_emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their <head>atmospheres</head> . The results of present observations of the thermal radio_emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared_emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . Observations of the radio_emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to_a_greater_extent than those using shorter wave_lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface .</context>

      <context> Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built_up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate . A system had_to be used which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time . A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure . By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular_weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an <head>atmosphere</head> . The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper_limit of the apparatus on_hand . The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular_weights which were stated to be 520 and 300 . These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular_weight .</context>

      <context> This method in_general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations of reactants in each of the six cells from a set . The samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary_tubing 2.5 mm. i.d. and about 15 cm. long . In a_few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing of 1 mm. wall thickness . Both types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 <head>atmospheres</head> exerted by the carbon_tetrachloride at 220 ` . The photochemical_reaction cells consisted_of 10 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing , 5.5 cm. long , diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed_through only liquid glass interfaces and not gas glass interfaces . These cells were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon_tetrachloride . The round cells were reproducibly positioned in the light_beam which entered the thermostated mineral_oil bath through a window .</context>

Sarason et_al. present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test like situation , and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher .
