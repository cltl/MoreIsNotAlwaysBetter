      <context> `` Only a discontinuity can end it '' , Professor_Morrison writes . `` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' . Morrison points_out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet_Union or Red_China , it is the most vulnerable of the great_powers - Europe of_course must be written_off out_of_hand . He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the <head>United_States</head> is the least risky path our government can take . His proposal is opposed to that of Richard_Nixon , Governor_Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic_Energy_Commission , Dr._Edward_Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold_war . These gentlemen are calling_for a resumption of testing - in the atmosphere - on the greatest possible scale , all in_the_name_of national security . Escalation is their first love and their last ; they will be faithful unto death .</context>

      <context> The nuclear war is already being fought , except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets - not_yet . It is being fought , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think_factories . They predicted escalation , and escalation is what we are getting . The biggest nuclear device the <head>United_States</head> has exploded measured some 15 megatons , although our B-52s are said to be carrying two 20 - megaton_bombs apiece . Some time ago , however , Mr._Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the Soviet_Union would make them . He seems to have at_least a_few 30 - and 50 - megaton_bombs on_hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock . And now , of_course , the hue_and_cry for counter escalation is being raised on our side .</context>

      <context> This epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk 1040 . Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort_Daer for food . Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round . Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony on the Red prompted the <head>United_State</head> War_Department in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel_Henry_Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie_du_Chien , until then the most advanced United_States post . In September 1822 two companies of infantry arrived_at the mouth of the St._Peter's_River , the head of navigation on the Mississippi , and began construction of Fort_St._Anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in_honor_of its commander , Colonel_Josiah_Snelling . It was from the American outposts that Red_River shortages of livestock were to be made good . Hercules_L._Dousman , fur trader and merchant at Prairie_du_Chien , contracted to supply Selkirk 's people with some 300 head of cattle , and Alexis_Bailly and Francois_Labothe were hired as drovers .</context>

      <context> And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent . This is the only case in modern history of a_people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view_as foreign domination . The fact is_due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold . In every war of the <head>United_States</head> since the Civil_War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country . So instead of being tests of the South 's loyalty , the Spanish_War , the two World_Wars , and the Korean_War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion . And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold_war against Communism . Had the situation been reversed , had , for_instance , England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New_England , there is little doubt that large_numbers of Southerners would have happily put_on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain .</context>

      <context> We of the liberal led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation . Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally . During the next five years the leaders of the Fair_Deal reluctantly backed_down from the optimistic expectations of the New_Deal . During the next five years liberal leaders in the <head>United_States</head> sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment - and the bitterest irony - enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : the atom_bomb . In 1952 , it will be remembered , the G._O._P. without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly . All_of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you .</context>

      <context> The second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower 's Commission_on_National_Goals , titled Goals_For_Americans . They , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower requested that the Commission be administered by the American_Assembly_of_Columbia_University , because it was non-partisan . The Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of_what I would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism . And here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above : `` The paramount goal of the <head>United_States</head> , set long_ago , was to guard the rights of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity '' . This group is secularist and their program tends to be technological . But it is the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as symptom of the common_man 's malaise . And let me add Murray 's new book as another symptom of_it , particularly so in_view_of the attention Time magazine gave it when it came_out recently .</context>

      <context> He points_out that from the time of Jackson on through World_War_1 , , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America . He terms this early enthusiasm `` Romantic_Christianity '' and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of_that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical Protestantism '' . Let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme . He says : `` Beside the Protestant philosophy of Progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the <head>United_States</head> to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy '' . He specifies , `` In the middle period of the Nineteenth Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism , in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism . But in every period it has been humanism '' . And let me add , utopianism , also .</context>
