      <context> In the nations of the British Empire , although the full stop could be used in typewritten material and its use was not banned , the interpunct ( also known as the <head>decimal</head> point , point , or mid dot ) was preferred for the decimal mark in printing technologies that could accommodate it , e.g. 99·95 . However , as the mid dot was already in common use in the mathematics world to indicate multiplication , the SI rejected its use as the decimal mark . During the beginning of British metrication in the late 1960s and with impending currency decimalisation , there was widespread debate in the United Kingdom as to whether the decimal comma or decimal point should be preferred : the British Standards Institution and some sectors of industry advocated the comma and the Decimal Currency Board advocated for the point .</context>

      <context> The heat transfer to the anode in free_burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas_jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up **f . This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated in_detail by Maecker ( Ref. 1 ) . The pressure gradient producing the jet is_due to the nature of the magnetic_field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) . Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free_burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation <head>point</head> . it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free_burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode .
