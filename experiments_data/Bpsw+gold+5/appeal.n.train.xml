      <context> <head>In</head> law , an appeal is the process in which cases are reviewed , where parties request a formal change to an official decision . Appeals function both as a process for error correction as well as a process of clarifying and interpreting law .</context>

      <context> Additionally , appellate courts have existed in Japan since at least the Kamakura Shogunate ( 1185â€“1333 CE <head>)</head> . During this time , the Shogunate established hikitsuke , a high appellate court to aid the state in adjudicating lawsuits . In the Eighteenth century , William Blackstone observed in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that appeals existed as a form of error correction in the common law during the reign of Edward III of England .</context>

      <context> However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including du_Pont 's competitors '' , 353_U._S._,_at_607 , outweighed the Government 's claim for relief . This claim , as submitted to the District_Court and dismissed by it , 126_F._Supp .235 , alleged violation not_only of 7 of the Clayton_Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman_Act . The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's <head>appeal</head> from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation .</context>

      <context> We found in Gonzales_v._United_States , supra , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant .

We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner 's contention , which was considered by the <head>appeal</head> board and denied by it .

      <context> While the regulations formerly required that the hearing_officer 's report be placed in the registrant 's file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952 . Moreover , the hearing_officer 's report is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney_General and , of_course , is not the recommendation of the Department . It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department_of_Justice , of which the Attorney_General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection . It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes_into the making of the final recommendation to the <head>appeal</head> board . It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing_officer 's notes were furnished to the appeal board . Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board .

In_addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes . While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process .</context>
