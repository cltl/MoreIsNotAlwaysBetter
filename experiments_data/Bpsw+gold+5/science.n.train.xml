However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals .

He was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof._J._G._L._Manthey ( 1769 - 1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in_addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` Lion_Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him .
