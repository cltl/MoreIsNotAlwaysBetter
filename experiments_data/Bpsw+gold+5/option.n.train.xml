      <context> As a moral <head>principle</head> , decisions should be made by those most affected by the decision , but this is not normally applied to persons in jail , who might likely make a decision other than to remain in jail . Robert Gates cited this principle in allowing photographs of returning war dead . When choosing between options one must make judgments about the quality of each option 's attributes .</context>

      <context> If the arrival at a choice includes more <head>complex</head> motivators , cognition , instinct and feeling can become more intertwined . Most people regard having choices as a good thing , though a severely limited or artificially restricted choice can lead to discomfort with choosing , and possibly an unsatisfactory outcome . In contrast , a choice with excessively numerous options may lead to confusion , regret of the alternatives not taken , and indifference in an unstructured existence ; and the illusion that choosing an object or a course leads necessarily to control of that object or course can cause psychological problems .</context>
