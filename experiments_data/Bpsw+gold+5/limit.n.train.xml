      <context> The movie was The Great_Train_Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all_but incalculable . Overnight , for_one_thing , Porter 's film multiplied the standard running_time of movies by ten . The Great_Train_Robbery is a one reel film . One reel - from eight to twelve minutes - became the standard length from the year of Robbery , 1903 , until Griffith shattered that <head>limit</head> forever with Birth_of_a_Nation in 1915 . The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies . The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself ; much of_it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of_it - good_guys and bad_guys in the old West - pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's . A band of robbers enters a railroad_station , overpowers and ties_up the telegraph_operator , holds_up the train and escapes .</context>

      <context> Obviously , a vicious_cycle develops . This tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways . It is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism . Before we comment further on these pathological conditions , we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological <head>limits</head> distinguish sleep from wakefulness . Thus , a low intensity of hypothalamic cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition . Moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induces , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous_system . With the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur .</context>

      <context> Or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big house , a Van_Rensselaer bride from way upstate near Albany , from Rensselaerwyck . And this handsome booby , staring and sweating , was he her bridegroom ? Martha picked_up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom . David_Cortlandt was tired beyond almost the <head>limits</head> of his flesh . He had ridden hard from Boston , and he was not used_to horseback . Now , driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer_Schuyler , he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move . The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather_than the Hudson_River Valley of his boyhood memories .</context>

      <context> The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent . On all sides doors were being slammed in his face . The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity . Now , under the impact of his wife 's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a <head>limit</head> to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be . He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half_sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted_in would involve them in a common ruin . For_the_moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity . But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing .</context>
