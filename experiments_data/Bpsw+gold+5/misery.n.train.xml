      <context> As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community . Everyone in Salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept_up by it . It is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with Abigail and Parris , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it . It grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of <head>misery</head> , moral disintegration , and destruction . The audience leaves the play under a spell , It is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes . If one asks about this play , what it is that comes_upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than `` spirit '' . This is not to attempt to say what spirit is , but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience .</context>

      <context> In this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative . The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of_course . But it is our health - more precious than all the money in the world - that these modern witch_doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away . By preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical_care , these medical ghouls create pain and <head>misery</head> by their very activity . Typically , Sarah_Gross and Mr._A both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks . Sarah_Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her . As a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor '' was using were phony .</context>

      <context> The sentence : 360 days ' confinement in the county jail . An isolated case of quackery ? By_no_means . Rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the <head>miseries</head> of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases . The machine quack makes his Rube_Goldberg devices out of odds_and_ends of metals , wires , and radio parts . With these gadgets - impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light_bulbs , ticks , and buzzes - he then carries_out a vicious medical con_game , capitalizing on people 's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age . He milks the latest scientific advances , translating them into his own special Buck_Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay_fever to sexual impotence and cancer .</context>

      <context> Only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power : in Guatemala . And contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures '' and `` world opinion '' to bring_down that Communist government ; we moved decisively to effect an anti Communist coup_d_'_etat . We served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human <head>misery</head> .</context>

      <context> The soldiers are fighting and the Americans are helping , he said , but in the fight against the Pathet_Lao the key factor is the villager himself . Then we were off again . We did it for three days . But our stumping tour of the south was n't all <head>misery</head> . Crossing the 4000 - foot width of the Mekong at Champassak , on a raft with an outboard_motor , we took_off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze . Then we hung overboard in the water . Briefly we rolled over a paved road up_to Pak_Song , on the cool Bolovens_Plateau .</context>

      <context> Then more_than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness . This comes_out in `` When_the_Bells_Ring '' , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes . In `` The_King 's_Ride '' , Charles breaks_out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from Turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years . He finds it in utter <head>misery</head> and desolation . All his people ask for is no more war . But he plunges into yet another , this time with Norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of_age when he died . He had become king at fifteen .</context>

      <context> `` There is a spark dwells deep within my soul . To get it out into the daylight 's glow Is my life 's aim both first and last , the whole . It slips_away , it burns and tortures me . That little spark is all the wealth I know , That little spark is my life 's <head>misery</head> '' . A dominant motive is the poet 's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations : `` Not men folk , but the fields where I would stray , The stones where as a child I used_to play '' . He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading . What he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause '' to which he can honestly devote himself .</context>

      <context> Would condemnation be fitting if , independently of the condemnation , there were nothing bad to condemn ? In such a case , any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other , which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point . Indeed we are forced to go much farther . If goodness and badness lie_in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them , those men who greeted death and <head>misery</head> with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line . If there is nothing evil in these things , if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them , why should n't they be greeted with a cheer ? To greet them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something bad ; it would needlessly bring badness into the world ; and even on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright . On_the_other_hand , to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good ; it would bring goodness into the world .</context>
