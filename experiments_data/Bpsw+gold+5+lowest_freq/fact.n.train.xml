      <context> Suddenly my reflexes are gone . Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . And so it was over the weekend what with 40 - year old Warren_Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants ' Willie_Mays retaliating with a record tying 4 - homer spree Sunday . Both , of_course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the <head>fact</head> that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . It was a real stimulant to a_lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2 - score year milestone . And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` Wish I was 40 , and a top grade big_leaguer .</context>

      <context> London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels . These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record . In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special_effects . Some clue to the character of London 's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the <head>fact</head> that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion '' or `` percussive '' . Drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive_instruments are reproduced remarkably well . Only_too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined_up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right . They are definitely in the same room with you , but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis_court watching a spirited volley .</context>

      <context> If we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing . Records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music . This difference is made_up of many factors . Some of them are obvious , such as the <head>fact</head> that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings . ( Music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat . ) From the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original . Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests .</context>

      <context> Acreage in_excess_of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones . Shape of the area is also related_to the use attractions and needs of the development . A large picnic_area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in_width in_preference_to a long narrow area less_than one_hundred feet wide . This is true because of savings in utility lines and the <head>fact</head> that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions . However , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman 's trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit . The values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there . For_instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might_not .</context>

      <context> Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' . Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja_vu ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences . In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all_of us grope continually . When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja_vu , except for the <head>fact</head> that he knows just why the experience seems familiar . Occasionally there are examples of prevision which cannot be pushed_aside without confessing an unscientific attitude . One day Maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in_advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified . Rudyard_Kipling 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ?</context>

      <context> Freud probably contributed more_than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation_Of_Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the <head>fact</head> that they are original , visual continuities . I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town . I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in_detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen . And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious_mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind .</context>

      <context> Every dream , and this is true of a mental_image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic_phenomenon for which no explanation is available . In most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects . But these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we do n't remember having seen in real_life . For_instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and , with photographic realism , sees Smith driving the car ; whereas , it is a matter of <head>fact</head> that Smith cannot drive a car . There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams . The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental_image can find no logical support . A `` mental_image '' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at_all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth_dimension .</context>

So here . The horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone_wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed_up as a whore dressing_up as a baby ; the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; the bringing_together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering '' ) ; the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant - all this seems a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ; beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann 's work .</context>

For_example , suppose a man wearing a $ 200 watch , driving a 1959 Rolls_Royce , stops to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` What time is it '' ? This sentence would have most_of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the <head>fact</head> that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car . If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation .

However , for convenience we will stick_to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 .</context>

      <context> A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting . In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such_as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs . The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated . Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies_in the <head>fact</head> that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity . A state of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not_only an increase in the parasympathetic reactivity this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli , but leads also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus acting sympathetically under control_conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response ! Furthermore , conditioned_reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level , and several types of behavioral changes probably related_to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observed . If , for_instance , such a change is produced by one or a_few insulin comas or electroshocks , previously inhibited conditioned_reactions reappear .</context>

      <context> However , if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished . In other studies , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned_reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatments , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes . It has further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ( 2 ) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned_reactions ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned_stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned_reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing ( alerting ) effect on the EEG . These are few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important <head>fact</head> that fundamental alterations in conditioned_reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes . The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion . If this is the case , one would expect that not_only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional_state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise . We pointed_out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic_disorders and neurotic symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( `` abreaction '' ) may cure a battle neurosis .</context>

Specific differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging_to the same group as , for_instance , between reserpine and chlorpromazine .

      <context> There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto Yokuts . This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very_much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; or both . The differentiation however is not very_much greater , as shown by the <head>fact</head> that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . ( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem / item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . ) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is_due to differences in the two sets of lists used .</context>

      <context> Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure . Whether or not it is in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends_upon the extent to which the public limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase . The extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase . We are abstracting from the <head>fact</head> of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put_up by the industry . The industry may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in_order to `` educate '' the government and the customers of the industry . As a strike continues , these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement . They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail .</context>

Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for_example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure_up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . This circumstance in the patient 's case plus the <head>fact</head> that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at_hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that_is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever .

We do not arrive_at spatial images by means of the sense_of_touch by itself . ( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual_sensation only by way of visual representations ; that_is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual_space '' .</context>

      <context> The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree . Much which was in_embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 . In this process the Minoan Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected ; the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800 . Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times - granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside - are correct ; but all_too many observers have been misled by this <head>fact</head> into minimizing the degree of change which took_place in the early first millennium . The focus of novelty in this world now lay_in the south-eastern districts of the Greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean , always excepting its northern shores , had accepted the Geometric style of pottery . While Protogeometric vases usually turn_up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as_many or more examples of local stamp , these `` non Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century . In their place came local variations within the common style - tentative , as_it_were , in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed .</context>
