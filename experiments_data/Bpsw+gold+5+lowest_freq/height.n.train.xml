      <context> Mathematically , a summit is a local maximum in elevation . The topographic terms " acme " , " apex " <head>,</head> " peak " , and " zenith " are synonyms . The term " summit " is generally used only for a mountain peak with some significant amount of topographic prominence ( height above the lowest point en route to the nearest higher peak ) or topographic isolation ( distance from the nearest point of higher elevation ) ; for example , a boulder next to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit .</context>

      <context> Attorney_General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more_than 4000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights . Then , not many years later , the Un-American_Activities_Committee , under the leadership of Martin_Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens . Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government . This hysteria reached its <head>height</head> under the leadership of Senator_Joseph_McCarthy .

      <context> Similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping , or organification , or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis . The name thyroid-stimulating_hormone ( TSH ) has been given to a substance found in the anterior pituitary_gland of all species of animal so_far tested for its presence . The hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic_hormone . At the present_time we do not know by what biochemical_mechanism TSH acts_on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean <head>height</head> of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of * * f . Here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of TSH in blood . Brown ( 1959 ) has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying TSH , and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject . As long_ago as 1851 it was pointed_out by Niepce ( 1851 ) that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid .</context>
