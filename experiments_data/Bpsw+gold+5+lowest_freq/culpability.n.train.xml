      <context> <head>Culpability</head> , or being culpable , is a measure of the degree to which an agent , such as a person , can be held morally or legally responsible for action and inaction . Culpability marks the dividing line between moral evil , like murder , for which someone may be held legally responsible and a randomly occurring event , like earthquakes , for which no human can be held responsible .</context>

Except for strict liability crimes , the type and severity of punishment often follow the degree of culpability . " Culpability means , first and foremost , direct involvement in the wrongdoing , such as through participation or instruction " , as compared with responsibility merely arising from " failure to supervise or to maintain adequate controls or ethical culture " . Modern criminal codes in the United States usually make distinct four degrees of culpability .</context>

      <context> There is one more type of culpability , and that is strict liability . In strict liability crimes , the actor is responsible no matter what his mental state ; if the result occurs , the actor is liable . An example is the felony murder rule : if the <head>prosecution</head> proves beyond reasonable doubt that one commits a qualifying felony ( see the article ) during which death results , one is held strictly liable for murder and the prosecution does not have to prove any of the normal culpability requirements for murder .</context>
