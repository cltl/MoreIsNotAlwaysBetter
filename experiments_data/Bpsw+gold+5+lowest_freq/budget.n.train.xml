      <context> In 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at $ 18.9 billion , compared to $ 19.3 billion in 1960 . The decreases , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such_as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic_devices . Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 . New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this <head>budget</head> for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) totals $ 4753 million , which is $ 1390 million below that enacted for 1960 . On_the_other_hand , the new authority of $ 3825 million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is $ 581 million higher than for 1960 . These contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed_Forces in the years ahead . The Department_of_Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items .</context>

One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this <head>budget</head> concerned the role of the B-70 , a long range supersonic bomber . This aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic_missile systems , all_of which are scheduled to become available earlier . The first Atlas ICBM 's are now operational , the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar_year , and the first Titan ICBM 's next year .

      <context> Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year . Other factors increasing operating_costs include the higher unit_cost of each flying hour , up 11 % in two years , and of each steaming hour , up 15 % . In total , these increases in operating_costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such_as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed_Forces . In the <head>budget</head> message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 ) . This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying_out certain transactions involving real_property unless they come into agreement with the Committees_on_Armed_Services of the Senate and the House_of_Representatives . As I have stated previously , the Attorney_General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles . Accordingly , if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise .</context>
