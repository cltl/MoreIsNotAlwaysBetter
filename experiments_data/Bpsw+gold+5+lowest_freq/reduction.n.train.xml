      <context> In some areas , the progress is slower than in others . In agriculture , for_example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster . In child_care , the opposite extreme prevails ; procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory . There are many domains in which understanding has brought_about widespread and quite appropriate <head>reduction</head> in ritual and fear . Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared . The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it . In_fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in_this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears .</context>

Perhaps the most illuminating example of the <head>reduction</head> of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease . The situation with regard_to our attitude and `` control '' of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with_respect_to people .

Regardless of its unadjusted allotment , each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each_year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal_year 1954 - increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to $ 23000000 . The funds recouped by <head>reductions</head> in item 12 above are used : first , to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment ( item 13 above ) ; and second , to increase uniformly the allotments to those States whose allotments are below their maximums , with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby exceeding its maximum . For the States which maintain two separate agencies - one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of persons other_than the blind - the Act specifies that their minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal_year 1954 . Funds allotted in_addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine . As is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula .</context>

      <context> Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army_Reserve . Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National_Guard contained in the 1960 Department_of_Defense Appropriation_Act should likewise be dropped . I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . I again proposed a <head>reduction</head> in the Army National_Guard and Army_Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal_year 1961 . These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives . - About 30 % of the expenditures for the Department_of_Defense in 1961 are for military_personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel . These expenditures are estimated to be $ 12.1 billion , an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social_security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) .</context>

Retired pay costs are increased by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel . These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $ 56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned <head>reduction</head> in strength of the Army_Reserve components during 1961 . Traditionally , rates_of_pay for retired military_personnel have been proportionate to current rates_of_pay for active personnel . The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing_for a 6 % increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958 . I endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay_rates .</context>

      <context> Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free_burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point . it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free_burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode .

An attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must , therefore , aim at a <head>reduction</head> of the anode loss . The following possibilities exist for achieving this : 1 .

      <context> Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85 ` in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation_energy and the effect of light intensity . In all cases there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination . By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation_energies ranging from 11 to 18 * * f was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases . It was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of <head>reduction</head> of a uranyl_oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions based on the differences in the absorption_spectra of uranyl_oxalate and of chlorine , and considering the spectral distribution of the light source . These estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon_tetrachloride at 65 ` is of the order_of_magnitude of unity . When typical reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated , chlorine and phosgene were produced . Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at * * f .</context>

      <context> After this brief discussion of neo - , paleocortical , and cortico-hypothalamic relations , let us return once_more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance . Facilitatory processes take_place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways . Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges . On_the_other_hand , the temporary <head>reduction</head> in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored . Apparently , a positive_feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral_cortex . Consequently , if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level , the lessened hypothalamic cortical discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges . Obviously , a vicious_cycle develops .</context>

      <context> If * * f is the null_space of * * f , then Theorem 12 says that * * f . In_other_words , if f satisfies the differential_equation * * f , then f is uniquely expressible in the form * * f where * * f satisfies the differential_equation * * f .

      <context> An extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatic description of each form . Equivalents could be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context . Thus , one can think_of a dictionary_entry as a word rather than a form . If all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary , a considerable <head>reduction</head> in the amount of information required is possible . For_example , the inflected forms of a word can be represented , insofar as regular inflection allows , by a stem and a set of endings to be attached .

      <context> Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit_margins related to a productivity increase should be shared . The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity share increases as distinct from a cost raising increase in the basic wage rate . We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price level increases may offset wage rate increases , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate . For internal political reasons , the union asks for ( and accepts ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously oppose a <head>reduction</head> in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up_to the discretion of the companies of the industry . Changes in the basic wage rate are cost raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices . However , it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude . In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled_out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise .</context>
