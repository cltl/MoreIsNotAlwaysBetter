      <context> The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality . When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering . The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic_equipment has enormous possibilities . The <head>benefits</head> electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by_far than any previous medical discovery . We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research . Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray_machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy_machine . Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis .</context>

      <context> There may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain . Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully - and with some imagination ? In your sales_force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make_out better with a larger number of lower paid salesmen ? Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in_return_for some <head>benefit</head> they can share ? In one company covering the country with a high quality sales_force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos. . As a result , distribution_costs were cut , customer relations improved . Distribution_costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties - and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job .</context>

      <context> So an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation . In_any_event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the `` disease '' , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical . Have not our physical_abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ? Hence the prime issue , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the <head>benefit</head> of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature . We are already committed to establishing man 's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social political economical context we are fond of today . Otherwise , we go_on endlessly trying to draw_the_line , color and other , as to which kind_of man we wish to see dominate . We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else .</context>

      <context> Yesterday , I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U._S._News_+_World_Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its disadvantages . Under leave to extend my remarks , I include the relevant portion of my newsletter , together with the text of the article from the U._S._News_+_World_Report : `` Cuban S._S._R. : Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro held mainland last week , there was at_least one positive <head>benefit</head> , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian dominated military base . In_fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment . Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought_home to all_of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home . Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United_States , violate the Monroe_Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin_American republic .</context>

      <context> The Central has pointed_out . `` The logic of creating a strong , balanced , competitive two system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B._+_O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here .

Then , abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , B. + O. entered on-again-off-again negotiations with C. + O. which resulted in the present situation . In the light of the facts at_hand , however , New_York_Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two system eastern railroad structure in the public interest `` .

      <context> Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted . Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social_system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective . In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them - and that with independence free_men do not have_to work to realize the <head>benefits</head> of modern life . For_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement . The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies .</context>

      <context> Both parties and the Ministry_of_the_Interior were busily at_work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance . Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation . The general setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization . The concentration of effective power in Rabat leads not_only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary <head>benefits</head> in_addition to contributing to more meaningful elections . Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber_of_Commerce elections , which took_place three weeks before national elections . The Istiqlal sponsored U.M.C.I.A. ( L'Union_Marocaine_des_Commercants , Industrialistes_et_Artisans ) was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P. ( L'Union_National_des_Forces_Populaires ) in nearly all urban_centers . As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen , the U.M.C.I.A. was generally favored against the more progressive , labor based U.N.F.P. The newer party campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small_businessmen to support them as they had done for many years .</context>

      <context> A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training_programs in the area to supply future skilled_workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees . The existence of a public_school vocational training_program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled . Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked_out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being . Thus , besides the training provided to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary <head>benefits</head> to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts . Few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry . The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad_hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment_training_programs that my be quickly set_up in a community to aid a new industrial plant . The major weakness of vocational training_programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands .</context>
