      <context> Dr._H._V._Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University_of_Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification . As_a_matter_of_fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr._Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day . Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest 's information . Dr._Hilprecht was uncertain as to the <head>language</head> used by the ancient priest in his dream . He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite , and imagined it must have been German or English . We may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr._Hilprecht 's subconscious reasoning . But , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ?</context>

      <context> He may be the only song_writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the U._S._Treasury ; he collaborated on a song with William_Hartman_Woodin , who was Secretary of the Treasury , 1932 - 33 . When Johnny_Mercer and Harold_Arlen began their collaboration in 1940 , Mercer , like Arlen , had several substantial film songs to his credit , among them `` Hooray_for_Hollywood '' , `` Ride , Tenderfoot , Ride '' , `` Have_You_Got_Any_Castles , Baby ? '' , and `` Too_Marvelous_for_Words '' ( all with Richard_Whiting ) ; with Harry_Warren he did `` The_Girl_Friend_of_the_Whirling_Dervish '' , `` Jeepers Creepers '' , and `` You_Must_Have_Been_a_Beautiful_Baby '' . Mercer 's lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances , a puckish sense_of_humor expressed in <head>language</head> with a colloquial flair . Though versatile and capable of turning_out a ballad lyric with the best of them , Mercer 's forte is a highly polished quasi folk wit . His casual , dreamlike working methods , often as not in_absentia , were an abrupt change from Harburg 's , so that Arlen had_to adjust again to another approach to collaboration . There were times that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously .</context>
