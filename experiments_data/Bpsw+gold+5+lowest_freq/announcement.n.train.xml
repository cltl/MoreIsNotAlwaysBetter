      <context> He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices . Han 's student days were at_a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent . The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in_charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university . He was stirred by the <head>announcement</head> of Volta 's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic_pile to experiments with acids and alkalis . The following year he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr '' , traveling in Germany , France , and the_Netherlands , meeting the philosophers Schelling , Fichte , and Tieck . He also met Count_Rumford ( born Benjamin_Thompson in Woburn,_Mass . ) who was then serving the Elector_of_Bavaria , and the physicist Ritter ; these were Oersted 's main contacts in science .

      <context> Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social_system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective . In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them - and that with independence free_men do not have_to work to realize the benefits of modern life . For_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its <head>announcement</head> . The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies . We should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call_for effort as_well_as enthusiasm .</context>
