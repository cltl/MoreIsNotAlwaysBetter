      <context> From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail . The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today 's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat . For many_of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood_vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed . A group of <head>researchers</head> at the University_of_Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques . One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched . A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed . Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood_vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy .</context>

      <context> And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive - the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response . Marriage manuals and women 's magazine_articles began to stress the importance of the female climax . They began to describe in_detail the woman 's capacity for response . In_fact , the noted psychologist and sex <head>researcher</head> , Dr._Albert_Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men . According to Dr._Ellis , the average 20 - year old American woman is capable of far greater sexual_arousal than her partner . Not surprisingly , Dr._Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out_to claim these capabilities . Yet , paradoxically , according to Dr._Maurice_Linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing_up to them .</context>
