      <context> The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League_clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition <head>decision</head> , this one to the Kansas_City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . Indications as_late_as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory drought as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage . Over the first five frames , Jack_Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in_the_middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American_League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick_Hyde , submarine_ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock .</context>

      <context> So with four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 1 , four of No. 2 , four of No. 3 and four to six sets of the Incline_Bench_Press , you can see that Henri_de_Courcy has had a terrific mass building , muscle shaping , torso defining workout that cannot be improved upon . Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone . Rarer still is a Mr._America or Mr._Universe of true Herculean build . The aspects of physical development that catch the judges ' eyes and which rightfully influence their <head>decisions</head> are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion - superior definition of the muscles . Now good definition is one thing that all_of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light weight workouts . But contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor 's chisel - is something quite different . This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him .</context>

      <context> The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature 's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them . With the exception of the Roman_Catholic and the Orthodox_Catholic_Churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice . Here is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement . The grounds for the Church 's position are Scriptural ( Old_Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the <head>decisions</head> of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural_law . The latter plays a prominent role in Roman_Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods . The Roman_Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end . This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God 's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements .</context>

      <context> He receives remuneration for his work . In a_few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student , while still in school , to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation . Adult_education courses , work-study_programs of various sorts - these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth . In_general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high_school , the school authorities play little or no part in the <head>decision</head> of what happens next . If the student drops_out of high_school , the break with the school is even more complete . When there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement - or lack of arrangement - works_out quite well . Indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work .</context>

      <context> But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation - the sort of change which Tacitus was talking_about when he said , `` They make a desert , and call it peace '' ( `` Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' . ) . Moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable ; it can be changed ; it has been , many times . Mr._Justice_Taney 's Dred_Scott <head>decision</head> in 1857 was unpopular in the North , and soon became a dead_letter . Prohibition was the law of the land , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took_up drinking in prohibition days , drinking was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated Northeast ! ) and was repealed .

      <context> This claim , as submitted to the District_Court and dismissed by it , 126_F._Supp .235 , alleged violation not_only of 7 of the Clayton_Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman_Act . The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its <head>decision</head> solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' .</context>

The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' . 353_U._S._,_at_589 . Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's <head>decision</head> . Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du_Pont and General_Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute .</context>

      <context> It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins ' pronouncement in Pleas_of_the_Crown from a metaphysical point_of_view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married_couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such_that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal_law as if there were no marriage . By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent <head>decision</head> in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of law '' .</context>
