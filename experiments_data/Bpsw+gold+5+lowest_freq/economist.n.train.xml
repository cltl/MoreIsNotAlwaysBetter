      <context> Economics graduates are employable in varying degrees , depending on the regional <head>economic</head> scenario and labour market conditions at the time for a given country .

      <context> To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the lot next_door . If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened_away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program . And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble . Today , according_to land <head>economist</head> Homer_Hoyt , shopping_centers and their associated parking_lots cover some 46000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land_area in all the nation 's Central Business_Districts put together . The downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety , both within its gates and across the street , where other department_stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making_up_her_mind . If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children 's clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too_much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount_business in big-ticket items . Department_stores were built_on dry_goods , especially ladies ' fashions , and in this area , in_the_long_run , the suburban branches will be hard_put to compete against downtown .</context>
