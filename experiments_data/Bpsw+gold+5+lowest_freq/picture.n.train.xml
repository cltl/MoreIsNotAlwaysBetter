      <context> Now again in 1961 , in England , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity . The Church_Unity_Octave , January 18 - 25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches . Many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 . But it must be readily seen that the religious <head>picture</head> in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at_least on the Catholic side . For `` the_tide_is_well_on_the_turn '' , as the London_Catholic_weekly_Universe has written . I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal_Newman . As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated country .</context>

      <context> Not discussed here are some military problems of modern_times such_as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision_making are not the bottlenecks . Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain_forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach . This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for_example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry . We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all <head>picture</head> and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes . This problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis . Since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it . First , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist .</context>

      <context> In free_burning electric arcs , for_instance , approximately 90 % of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving_rise to local heat fluxes in excess of **f as measured by the authors - the exact value depending_on the arc atmosphere . In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high_temperature research tools often more than 50 % of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode . The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical_phenomena occurring in free_burning arcs . In plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the <head>picture</head> somewhat . The heat transfer to the anode is_due to the following effects : 1 . Heat_of_condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic_energy of the electrons impinging_on the anode . This energy transfer depends_on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode sheath .</context>

      <context> The negatively_charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go_into the aqueous phase . This hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency . It does not consider the kinetic effects of the phosphate builders on sorption desorption phenomena which will be discussed later ( see pp. 1746 - 1748 ) . The crude <head>picture</head> of the detergency process thus_far developed can be represented as : * * f The influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic_energy on a molecular scale . Freed soil must be dispersed and protected against flocculation . Cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil . It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe .</context>

      <context> Hydroxides , orthophosphates , borates , carbonates , and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hard surface cleaners . In_addition , the polyphosphates are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else . The importance of the inorganic constituents in hard surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers . Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date <head>picture</head> of the physical_chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces . The purpose of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories given below : Dirt , which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties . Greasy soils , which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats ( esters of glycerol with long chain organic acids ) .</context>

      <context> Bernard_Heuvelmans also treats of the largest snakes , but on the third level , and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda . He reasons that as anacondas 30 feet long are often found , some might be 38 , and occasional `` monstrous freaks '' over 50 . He rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more . His thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength , but these seem to be given to complete his <head>picture</head> , not to be believed . Detailed information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows . Discussions of the giants one_by_one will include , as_far_as_possible , data on these aspects of growth : size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; time required to reach maturity ; rate_of_growth both before and after this crucial stage ; and maximum length , with confirmation or amplification of Oliver 's figures .</context>

      <context> The dictionary is a form dictionary , at_least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary_entries . Also , the dictionary is divided into at_least two parts : the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms . A more detailed description of dictionary operations - text lookup and dictionary modification - give a clearer <head>picture</head> . Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists_of three steps . The first is compiling a list of text forms , assigning an information cell to each , and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence . For this step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the W_region are used for storage of the forms in the text form list ; cells in the X-region and Y_region are reserved as information cells for text forms .</context>

      <context> If the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar_volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put_in the bank . In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated . No suburban shopping-center branch - not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store . Telephone_orders distort the <head>picture</head> : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather_than a central city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminates city sales_tax . The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened . Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are .</context>
