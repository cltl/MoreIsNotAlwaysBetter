      <context> Interest is a <head>feeling</head> or emotion that causes attention to focus on an object , event , or process . In contemporary psychology of interest , the term is used as a general concept that may encompass other more specific psychological terms , such as curiosity and to a much lesser degree surprise . The emotion of interest does have its own facial expression , of which the most prominent component is having dilated pupils .</context>

      <context> The Fulton_County_Grand_Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary_election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took_place . The jury further said in term end presentments that the City_Executive_Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City_of_Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . The September October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior_Court_Judge_Durwood_Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate_Ivan_Allen_Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread <head>interest</head> in the election , the number of voters and the size of_this city '' . The jury said it did find that many_of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . The grand_jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton_County purchasing_departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' .</context>

      <context> The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came_out the best . There were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very_much to do as clergyman . Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public_press of mid Victorian England . There was so much <head>interest</head> shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on B.B.C. , where comments were equally made by an Anglican parson , a Free_Church minister and a Catholic priest . Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television_programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen . A notable example of this was the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool , Dr._Heenan , and the Anglican Archbishop of York , Dr._Ramsey , recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury . The good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well_known in England .</context>

      <context> Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality .

Those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather_than specific skills ought_to bear_in_mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience . I have been using the word `` vocational '' as a layman would at_first_sight think it should be used . I intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls .</context>

      <context> Indeed , one school_superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high_school for the senior_high_schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational_programs . He prefers to designate such schools as `` general '' high_schools . The suburban high_school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high_school because of the absence of vocational_programs . The reason is that there is a lack of <head>interest</head> on the part of the community . Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high_school described in my first report . The separate vocational or technical high_schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions . By_and_large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system .</context>

More_than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples . Since American life is committed above_all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis .

Manchester 's unusual <head>interest</head> in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev._J._D._Wickham , headmaster of Burr and Burton_Seminary , was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , Samuel_F._B._Morse . At_any_rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington . In 1846 Matthew_B._Goodwin , jeweler and watchmaker , became the town 's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the Equinox_House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont '' . Goodwin was telegrapher for the `` American_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Troy_and_Canada_Junction_Telegraph_Company '' .</context>

      <context> Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ_Church and Regius_Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance_English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . But to return to the main line of our inquiry . It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with <head>interest</head> do not even know that its author was a martyr . Utopia is still widely read because in_a_sense More stood on the margin of modernity . And if he did stand on the margins of modernity , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom . It was not even in writing Latin epigrams , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics , or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus 's philological study of the New_Testament .</context>

      <context> Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century . Had More 's writings been wholly limited to such exercises , they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or_so other authors living in his time , whose works tenuously survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works . More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone - because he wrote Utopia . And the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous <head>interest</head> with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or_so . Only one other contemporary of More 's evokes so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work - Niccolo_Machiavelli and The_Prince . Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response ? Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval , the Renaissance , and the modern .</context>

      <context> On October 31 , 1859 , John_Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder . For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in_public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 .

On Wednesday morning , November_2 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fairer trial .
