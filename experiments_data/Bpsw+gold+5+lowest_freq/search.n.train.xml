      <context> Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced . And although Schnabel 's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert 's dynamic markings and phrase indications . The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a <head>search</head> for superlatives . About the Pro_Arte 's contribution I am less happy . I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group . From a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro_Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here .</context>

      <context> ( 1 ) As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do . ( 2 ) If earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields . In the <head>search</head> for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources . We have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate . The following discussion of_this subject has been adapted from the book Causes_of_Catastrophe by L._Don_Leet . At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday , April 18 , 1906 , San_Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake .</context>

      <context> His cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present . He did not , however , find_himself at_once . His next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled Hans_Alienus , which Professor_Bo ^ o ^ k describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth . The hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East , a sort_of Faustus type , who , to quote from Professor_Bo ^ o ^ k again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful <head>search</head> after the meaning of life . He is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of Tiveden '' . From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self .

      <context> Beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high_society and low morals , always alone , always despised . In_the_end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care ; virtue is its own and only reward . A similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of Eric_Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery_stories , Dashiell_Hammett 's The Maltese_Falcon . Sam_Spade joins_forces with a band of adventurers in <head>search</head> of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; but when the bird is found at_last , it turns_out to be a fake . Now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves , who is also the real murderer . For Sam_Spade , neither crime nor virtue pays ; moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two . Because the private_eye intends to save society in_spite_of himself , he invariably finds himself in_trouble with the police .</context>

      <context> There is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else . Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important . Moreover , if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo thinking ; if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity . The second timely part of_this sketch of literature and the <head>search</head> for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary_works and the ephemeral mass_culture products of today . In the range and variety of characters who , in their literary lives , get_along all_right with life_styles one never imagined possible , there is an implicit lesson in differentiation . The reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ? and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species . The observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be , like the models he sees , even more like everybody else .</context>

      <context> The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done_with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery . It was a fine broody_hen , white , with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen . The doctor , with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope , drew Alex 's attention to those excellences which might otherwise have escaped him : the fine color in comb and wattles , the length and quality of neck and saddle_hackles , the firm , wide spread of the toes , and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets . All <head>search</head> was ended ; he had found his fowl . The purchase was effected and they made_their_way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set_up , nestling in the doctor 's arms .

The doctor was wearing a long New_England greatcoat , hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens .</context>

      <context> For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless <head>search</head> for a cup of hot coffee . They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor . The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue_pie , gets a plate of English_muffins instead . Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after_all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks_Atkinson retired .</context>

Aging but still precocious , French feline enfant_terrible Francoisette_Lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old Paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called The_Lascivious_Interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in_love with a middle-aged steam_shovel . A biting , pithy parable of the all pervading hollowness of modern life , the piece has been set by Mlle_Lagoon to a sumptuous score ( a single motif played over_and_over by four thousand French_horns ) by existentialist hot-shot Jean-Paul_Sartre . Petite , lovely Yvette_Chadroe plays the nymphomaniac engagingly .</context>

      <context> The battle of the drib-drool continues , but most of New_York 's knowing sophisticates of Abstract_Expressionism are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation of V ( for Vindication ) Day , September first , when Augustus_Quasimodo 's first one-man show opens at the Guggenheim . We have heard that after seeing Mr._Quasimodo 's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . And it is thought by many who think_about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet , progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso , and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De_Kooning . Quasimodo defines his own art as `` the <head>search</head> for what is not there '' . `` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to Franz_Kline and myself , `` the nothing that_is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non time '' . It is his relentlessness and unwavering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` The_Invasion_of_Cuba '' . In this work , his use of non color is startling and skillful .</context>
