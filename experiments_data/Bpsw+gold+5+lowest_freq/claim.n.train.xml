      <context> This recording surely belongs in everyone 's collection . Must records always sound like records ? From the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real_Thing have regularly been put in circulation . Seen in perspective , many_of these releases have a genuine <head>claim</head> to be milestones . Although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original . On the basis of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal under Karl_Muck 's baton , or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini created in his years with the New_York_Philharmonic . Since the concept of high_fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold .</context>

      <context> Since the concept of high_fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold . In many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects : the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer . Other innovations with better <head>claims</head> to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in_time the status of classics . If we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing . Records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music . This difference is made_up of many factors .</context>

      <context> In_the_first_place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale . Robert_Frost , for_instance , writes about rural life in New_England , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems . This has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk_poet '' , simply because he is a rural one . In the second place , a large_number of writers , making a more direct <head>claim</head> than Frost to being `` folk_writers '' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material . Stephen_Vincent_Benet 's John_Brown's_Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John_Steinbeck 's The_Grapes_of_Wrath and Carl_Sandburg 's The_People,_Yes . The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass . Folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it .</context>

      <context> On March 21 , 1957 , however , the Department recommended approval of the 1_,_-_A classification . Its ground for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date ) , that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the Jehovah's_Witnesses reported that he was no_longer doing so and , on_the_contrary , had relinquished both his Pioneer_and_Bible_Student_Servant positions . It reported that he now devoted only some 6 - 1_2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities . His <head>claim</head> was therefore `` so highly exaggerated '' , the Department concluded , that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and , consequently , upon his sincerity and good_faith '' . The appeal_board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation . In his answer thereto , he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 , and asserted that his only claim to `` pioneering '' was in 1952 . The appeal_board , however , unanimously concurred in the Department 's recommendation .</context>

      <context> Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing_officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due_process because he did not succeed . It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing_officer 's report and notes at the trial . In_addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes . While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such <head>claim</head> was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process . Moreover , his testimony at trial never developed any such facts . In the light of these circumstances , as_well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department 's recommendation , which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no relevancy in the hearing_officer 's report and notes . Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing_officer as_well as at the trial .</context>

      <context> But in_any_event , I submit that the power to depose belongs_to Congress , not to this Court . I dissent . Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious_objector , was convicted of violating 12 ( a ) of the Universal_Military_Training_and_Service_Act by refusing to be inducted into the armed_forces . He claims that he was denied due_process_of_law in violation of the Fifth_Amendment , because ( 1 ) at a hearing before a hearing_officer of the Department_of_Justice_, he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board , and ( 2 ) at the trial , he was denied the right to have the hearing_officer 's report and the original report of the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation as to his <head>claim</head> . Held : On the record in this case , the administrative procedures prescribed by the Act were fully complied with ; petitioner was not denied due_process ; and his conviction is sustained . Pp. 60 - 66 . Petitioner was not denied due_process in the administrative proceedings , because the statement in_question was in his file , to which he had access , and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing_officer of the Department_of_Justice and before the appeal_board .</context>

      <context> Wage price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces - no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage price behavior of a_few very important industries . While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular <head>claim</head> of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United_States since World_War_2 , . Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here presented . The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price_competition , but which is so basic that its wage price policies are held in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands .</context>
