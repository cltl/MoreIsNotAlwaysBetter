      <context> But dominant in the sense that every other objective , no_matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it . Peace is a worthy objective ; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin , then we must fight . Freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ; but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit , then Algerian freedom must be postponed . <head>Justice</head> is a worthy objective ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union_of_South_Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer . Prosperity is a worthy objective ; but if providing higher standards_of_living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made . It may be , of_course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in_favor_of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of Soviet Communist power . This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used .</context>

      <context> I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them . If they were , Walter_Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George_Sokolsky , and Herblock would have nothing to draw cartoons about . I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions . The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and <head>justice</head> and peace and material prosperity ; and in_particular - since this is our special responsibility - that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United_States . I speak_of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved - ever - reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human_beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around . These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism . This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in_practice , antithetical to these conditions ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization .</context>

      <context> When I question them as_to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall_into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things do n't count any_more in the world of to-day . I am naive , they say , to make use of such words . I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? - liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social <head>justice</head> is so great that individual and local liberties as_well_as democratic processes may have to yield before it . This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a President of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme_Court . As for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms . The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one .</context>

Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas , occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent_on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call_for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence <head>justice</head> .

In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical . J._Wheaton_Smith , editor of the Warren_Telegraph stated that `` the ends of <head>justice</head> must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in_order_that all those misnamed philantropists [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' . The editor of the Newport_Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment . In direct_contrast to the other Rhode_Island editors , Samuel_S._Foss of the Woonsocket_Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair . Concerning the sentence , Foss wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John_Brown 's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment , it would be well - well for the country and for Virginia '' .</context>
