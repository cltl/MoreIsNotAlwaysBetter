      <context> They are definitely in the same room with you , but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis_court watching a spirited volley . The Percussive Twenties ( SP 44006 ) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day , and Johnny_Keating 's Kombo gives_forth with tingling jazz in Percussive_Moods ( SP 44005 ) . Big_Band_Percussion ( SP 44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs - the arrangements just did n't have so much character as the others . There is an extraordinary sense of <head>presence</head> in all of these recordings , apparently obtained at_least in part by emphasizing the middle and high_frequencies . The penalty for this is noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano sounds in Melody_and_Percussion_for_Two_Pianos ( SP 44007 ) . All_of the releases , however , are recorded at a gratifyingly high level , with resultant masking of any surface_noise . Pass_in_Review practically guarantees enjoyment , and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system .</context>

      <context> When we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man 's worthlessness - until redeemed - the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time_and_time_again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state '' . Apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think_of the devil as being actually real . Yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over Salem . It casts a spell upon them so_that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious <head>presence</head> of an evil power . It is not enough in accounting_for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect . For this does not account_for the integral , elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell . The reality of spirit emerges in_this play in_spite_of the author 's convictions to_the_contrary .</context>

      <context> This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not_only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue . A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained . The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental_to playing . Yet you feel the orchestra is near at_hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm <head>presence</head> associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall . Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation . The music is always allowed the living_space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi performer . The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .</context>

      <context> It could continue this way , hitting 106 and more in the Valley , Joe_McFeeley knew , into October . He and Irvin_Moll were sipping coffee at the breakfast bar . Both had been up since 7 : 00 - Irv on the early morning watch , McFeeley unable to sleep during his four hour relief . The night before , they had telephoned the Andrus_maid , Selena_Masters , and she had arrived early , bursting her vigorous <head>presence</head> into the silent house with an assurance that amused McFeeley and confounded Moll . The latter , thanking her for the coffee , had winked and muttered , `` Sure_'_nuff , honey '' . Selena was the wrong woman for these crudities . With a hard eye , she informed Moll : `` Do n't sure_'_nuff me , officer .</context>

      <context> First_of_all , the six figures of the Buddha you heisted - four Siamese heads , a black obsidian statuette in the earth touching position , and a large brass figure of the Dying_Buddha on a teakwood base . Now , you probably share the widespread Western belief that the Lord_Buddha is the most compassionate of the gods , much more so than Jehovah and Allah and the rest . ' Fess up - do n't you ? Well , ordinarily he is , except ( as the Wheel_of_the_Law specifies ) toward impious folk who steal , disturb , or maltreat the <head>Presence</head> . Very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers . Eight or ten years ago , a_couple_of French hoods stole a priceless Khmer head from the Musee_Guimet , in Paris , and a week later crawled into the Salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy . Hell 's own amount of chaulmoogra_oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the Blessed_One to forgive their desecration .</context>
