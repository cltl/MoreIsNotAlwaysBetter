      <context> However , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual . And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership . This is not due_to any policy of discrimination on_the_part_of the Northern universities . Quite the contrary , as I can testify from personal experience as a former university <head>president</head> . Rather we see here another vicious_circle . The absence of successful Negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp_down enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers . I believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need_to be heavily publicized .</context>

      <context> I am naive , they say , to make use of such words . I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? - liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as_well_as democratic processes may have to yield before it . This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a <head>President</head> of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme_Court . As for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms . The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one . Why , in_the_first_place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ?</context>

      <context> Most assuredly ideas are invaluable . But ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough . In the 1930 's , cures for the depression literally flooded Washington . For a time the <head>President</head> received hundreds of them every_day , most_of them worthless . Ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate . When some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for_instance , we do not turn_to free and open discussion as in a political_campaign . We have recourse to the scientifically trained specialist in the laboratory .</context>

      <context> There is evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William_Gilmore_Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such_as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him . Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus_Baldwin_Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university <head>president</head> in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy_Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him . Others who wrote_of low characters and low life included Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , creator of the Big_Bear of Arkansas and Tom_Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson_Jones_Hooper , whose character Simon_Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem_Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried_out his will ; and George_Washington_Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut_Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner 's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a_hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner 's time . Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long established literary precedent .</context>

      <context> Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron_C._Burr and Mark_Manley of `` Burr_and_Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry_goods . Early equipment was very flimsy ; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles , making communications impossible . But companies continued to spring_up . By 1883 the `` Battenkill_Telegraph_Company '' was in existence and Alvin_Pettibone was its <head>president</head> . Operating in 1887 was the `` Valley_Telegraph_Line '' , officers of which were E._C._Orvis , president ; H._K._Fowler , vice-president and secretary ; J._N._Hard , treasurer ; F._H._Walker , superintendent ; H._S._Walker , assistant superintendent . Two companies now had headquarters with Clark_J._Wait , who by then had his own drugstore at Factory_Point - the `` Northern_Union_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Western_Union '' .

      <context> Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt_Hall meeting `` brought_together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many_of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' . Seated on the platform were Amos_C._Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; Thomas_Davis , an uncompromising Garrisonian ; the Reverend_Augustus_Woodbury , a Unitarian minister ; the Reverend_George_T._Day , a Free-Will Baptist ; Daniel_w._Vaughan , and William_H._H._Clements . The latter two were appointed secretaries . The first speaker was Amos_C._Barstow who had been unanimously chosen <head>president</head> of the meeting . He spoke of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared John_Brown of Harper_'s_Ferry to the John_Brown of Rhode_Island 's colonial period . Barstow concluded that as Rhode_Island 's John_Brown became a canonized hero , if not a saint , so would it be with John_Brown of Harper_'s_Ferry . The next speaker was George_T._Day .</context>

      <context> He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments . In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took_part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned '' . He recalled that in Rhode_Island a party opposed to the state 's condemnation of a man ( Thomas_W._Dorr ) proclaimed the state 's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty . At the close of Davis ' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the <head>president</head> , and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously : Whereas , John_Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper : Therefore , Resolved that , while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects , yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor .</context>
