      <context> If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result . Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call ' clicking ' . `` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do_well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition . `` If I have seemed to emphasize the <head>structure</head> of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color . Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in_relation_to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat . When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor - if I have been working on a full sheet in the field . `` When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal .</context>

      <context> From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a_few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research . Many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible_light and must be stained for microscopic investigation . This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or_else colors only the outside . A completely new insight into living cells and their <head>structure</head> will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible_light with ultraviolet_radiation and combines a microscope with a color - TV_system to view the results . Fig. 1 is a simplified block_diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical_Electronics_Center of Rockefeller_Institute . By combining the talents of a medical_man , Dr._Aterman , a biophysicist , Mr._Berkely , and an electronics expert , Dr._Zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes . Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet_radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in_front_of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources .</context>

      <context> The architects do not believe that the education of the interior_designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round_tables , workshops or panel_discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled_down crux_of_the_matter is education . It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of <head>structure</head> . This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior_designer 's training . We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior_design student as not having serious bearing on the subject . The real question that follows is - how are those four years used and what is their value as training ?</context>

      <context> If we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it . First , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per_se cannot take economic leadership . Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind . When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate <head>structure</head> by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism . The biggest loss , of_course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy . Socialism , I grant , has a definite place in our society . But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic .</context>

      <context> Obviously , a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in_place_of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil . Substances other_than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases . This is particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall_into the class of polyelectrolytes . Whereas the usual organic surface-active_agent is strongly sorbed at oil-water_interfaces , the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic <head>structure</head> ( see Table 26 - 2 on p. 1678 ) . Thus , for aqueous media , we can think_of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active_agent , and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active_agent . From the equilibrium sorption data which are available , it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative_charge . The charged particles then repel each other and are also repelled from the charged surface , which almost invariably bears a negative_charge under washing conditions .</context>
