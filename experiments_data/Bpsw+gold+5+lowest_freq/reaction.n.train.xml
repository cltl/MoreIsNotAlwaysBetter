      <context> If this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation . He has gained only one thing - he has exploded a 50 - megaton_bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges . But if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously . Not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general <head>reaction</head> outside the Soviet sphere . Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent_on following compulsively in his footsteps . When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural . Thus , when the Russians sent up their first sputnik , American chagrin was human enough , and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable .</context>

      <context> I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal_Newman . As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated country . Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England . In representing part of this new picture , I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , <head>reactions</head> and judgments ; but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican_Churches and about the present religious state of England . Since the Protestant clergy for_the_most_part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my Roman_collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman_Catholic cleric . In_any_case , I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen , even in Devonshire and Cornwall , where anti Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest . Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism .</context>

      <context> For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned . One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had_to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas_chambers . The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten - the gas_chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star_of_David - nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . Public_relations strategists everywhere , watching the <head>reaction</head> of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried_out : Too_much , too_much - the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had_to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most_of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing_on the corpus_delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject_to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs . Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection .</context>

      <context> An Ohio soldier who , from a comrade just returned from leave , received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister , took pen in hand and delivered himself thus : `` [ Dear Sis ] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy was a runing together all_the_time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no_more yuse .

      <context> Enthusiastically , Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul_Bunyan tales , Abe_Lincoln anecdotes and labor_union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition . Nor have we remembered that in the melting_pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material . Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional <head>reaction</head> to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant . As_long_as his material is Americana , can in_some_way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied . From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth century American folklore . On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought_out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make_up this nation .</context>

      <context> That sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of Torrio and Capone , was a nonsense . A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held_up a Torrio beer convoy on a West_Side street and demanded $ 300 to let it through . One of the beer runners telephoned O_'_Banion - on a line tapped by the detective bureau - and reported the situation . O_'_Banion 's <head>reaction</head> was : `` Three_hundred dollars ! To them bums ? Why , I can get them knocked_off for half that_much '' .</context>

      <context> The first half of The_Charles_Men , ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second . After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous . Like Napoleon , he was the worst of losers . There are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the <head>reactions</head> of the Swedes in adversity . Then more_than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness . This comes_out in `` When_the_Bells_Ring '' , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes . In `` The_King 's_Ride '' , Charles breaks_out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from Turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years .</context>

      <context> Both these youths , who greatly admired Henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring Friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine ; and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with Papa , whose mind - although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it - naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were . Besides , Miss_Henrietta - as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back - had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; so Cyrus_Adler became interested in her friend Racie_Friedenwald , and Joe_Jastrow - the only young_man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta , and signed himself Joe - fell_in_love with pretty sister Rachel . Henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe 's older and more serious brother , Morris , who was just_about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa , when he substituted for Rabbi_Jastrow at Rodeph_Shalom_Temple there during its Rabbi 's absence in Europe . Young Morris , who , while attending the University_of_Pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write Henrietta twenty page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of Sarah_Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his <head>reactions</head> to the comments of `` Sulamith '' on the Jewish reform_movement being promulgated by the Hebrew_Union_College in Cincinnati . Unlike his younger brother , Joe , he never presumed_to address her more familiarly than as `` My dear friend '' , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style . And when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and Papa did . One thing Papa had not taught Henrietta was how to handle a young_man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself .</context>

      <context> While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United_States since World_War_2 , . Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here presented . The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price_competition , but which is so basic that its wage price policies are held in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public <head>reaction</head> , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . In_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells_out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages .</context>

      <context> The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted . The readers of the Providence_Daily_Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old_Brown '' had a fair trial . Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' . In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' <head>reaction</head> to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical . J._Wheaton_Smith , editor of the Warren_Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in_order_that all those misnamed philantropists [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' . The editor of the Newport_Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment . In direct_contrast to the other Rhode_Island editors , Samuel_S._Foss of the Woonsocket_Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair .</context>
