      <context> Publishers , owners and other corporate executives , especially advertising sales executives , can try to use their powers over journalists to influence <head>how</head> news is reported and published . Journalists usually rely on top management to create and maintain a " firewall " between the news and other departments in a news organization to prevent undue influence on the news department . One journalism magazine , Columbia Journalism Review , has made it a practice to reveal examples of executives who try to influence news coverage , of executives who do not abuse their powers over journalists , and of journalists who resist such pressures .</context>

      <context> In others , <head>the</head> news media is independent from the government but the profit motive is in tension with constitutional protections of freedom of the press . Access to freely available information gathered by independent and competing journalistic enterprises with transparent editorial standards can enable citizens to effectively participate in the political processes . This compactness in coverage has been linked to broad audience attrition , as a large majority of respondents in recent studies show changing preferences in news consumption .</context>

      <context> U._S._Rubber_Company , New_York , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits . The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for_example , costs $ 227.72 . Have the insurance_company or your own accounting department break_down the cost of your insurance package periodically . You may find certain <head>coverage</head> costing much more_than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions . Check to see if some of your benefits - such_as on-the-job disability pay - can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you . Use deductable insurance wherever feasible . It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates .</context>

      <context> This leaves the ordering of entries variable . ( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it . ) Two very useful ways for modifying a form dictionary are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more_than one dictionary form . The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary <head>coverage</head> . The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents . Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at_once . An extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatic description of each form .</context>
