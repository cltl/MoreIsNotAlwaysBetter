      <context> - Held out_of Texas_Tech 's sweat_suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard_Stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders ' 38 - 7 loss to Texas_A+M . Because of its important game with Arkansas coming_up Saturday , Baylor worked_out in the rain Monday - mud or no mud . End Gene_Raesz , who broke a hand in the Owl 's game with LSU , was back working_out with Rice_Monday , and John_Nichols , sophomore guard , moved_back into action after a week 's idleness with an ankle injury . The Texas_Aggies got a day_off Monday - a special gift from Coach Jim_Myers for its <head>conference</head> victory last Saturday night , but Myers announced that halfback George_Hargett , shaken_up in the Tech game , would not play against Trinity Saturday . Halfback Bud_Priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly mending sprained ankle , joined TCU 's workout Monday . The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American_Football_League starts - a 19 - 12 triumph over the Denver_Broncos - but their visit will be a short one . The Texans have two more road_games - at Buffalo and Houston - before they play for the home_folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank_Stram 's men will meet the Bills just_as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings .</context>

      <context> Tailback James_Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games . Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington_State game , for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and_then uncorked a 56 - yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench . Wingback Jack_Collins injured a knee in the Washington_State game but insists he 'll be ready for Oklahoma . Last week , when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the <head>conference</head> 's top four in rushing , he said : `` That won't last long '' . It did n't ; Monday , he had four Longhorns in the top four . A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday , but attention quickly turned from Saturday 's victory to next week 's problem : Rice_University . The Mustangs do n't play this week .</context>
