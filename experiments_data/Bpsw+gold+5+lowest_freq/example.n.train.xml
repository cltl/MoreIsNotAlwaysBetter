      <context> Not altogether a successful play , `` Epitaph_for_George_Dillon '' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling . It is awfully talky , for_instance , and not all_of the talk is terribly impressive . But it strikes sparks on_occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten . There is a fine second act , as an <head>example</head> , one in which Samuel_Groom , as Dillon , has an opportunity to blaze_away in one impassioned passage after another . This is an exciting young actor to watch . Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura_Stuart , whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch . Miss_Stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment .</context>

      <context> There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud . And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact . Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man . Constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor_unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world_courts , and the veto power in world_councils are but a_few <head>examples</head> . Most_of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it . The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme . Just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding .</context>

      <context> The readers of the Providence_Daily_Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old_Brown '' had a fair trial . Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' . In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical . J._Wheaton_Smith , editor of the Warren_Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary <head>example</head> must be set , in_order_that all those misnamed philantropists [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' . The editor of the Newport_Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment . In direct_contrast to the other Rhode_Island editors , Samuel_S._Foss of the Woonsocket_Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair . Concerning the sentence , Foss wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John_Brown 's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment , it would be well - well for the country and for Virginia '' .</context>

      <context> But there 's one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just do n't think there is , and that 's a sportin ' way o ' killin ' a man '' ! After the first two murders , the warning notes were rarely ignored . The lesson had been learned . The <head>examples</head> were plain . When Fred_Powell 's brother-in-law , Charlie_Keane , moved_into the dead man 's home , the anonymous letter_writer took no chances on Charlie taking_up where Fred had left_off and wasted no time on a first notice : If you do n't leave this country within 3 days , your life will be taken the same as Powell 's was . This was the message found tacked to the cabin door .</context>
