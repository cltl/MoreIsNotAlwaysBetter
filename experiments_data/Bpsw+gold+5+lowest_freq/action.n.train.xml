      <context> You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before . I can n't tell when , but I'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! This experience will have happened to many of you . Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and <head>action</head> have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' . Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja_vu ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences . In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all_of us grope continually . When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja_vu , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar .</context>

      <context> Rudyard_Kipling 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ? The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something_About_Myself . One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster_Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , <head>action</head> and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more_than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation_Of_Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision .</context>

      <context> Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ? Every dream , and this is true of a mental_image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic_phenomenon for which no explanation is available . In most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects . But these are dreamed in original <head>action</head> , in some particular continuity which we do n't remember having seen in real_life . For_instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and , with photographic realism , sees Smith driving the car ; whereas , it is a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car . There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams . The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental_image can find no logical support .</context>

      <context> In regard_to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of_this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light_mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his <head>actions</head> flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent .

Thus , if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century , we will do_well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset . Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence . 1 ) Every age rewrites the events of its history in_terms_of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary <head>actions</head> . What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred . 2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness . Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account_for group_actions , to provide a focal_point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification .</context>

      <context> Of_course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth century United_States . Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man_in_the_street . It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine . After_all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental <head>actions</head> far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control . Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement . Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes . In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose .</context>

All this is simple enough , but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before . Each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , Porter 's camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play . The plane of the <head>action</head> in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen . If the change , at_first_sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the Italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen . In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as_well_as a mechanical recording device . He did more than that .</context>

      <context> A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint <head>action</head> in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . ) In a mobile society , congregational health depends_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like elements will have_to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation . In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per_cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' .</context>

      <context> The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part . These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some working for one 's good , others threatening ill . Gone is the tabula_rasa of the mind . In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the <head>actions</head> of one 's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught . The principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy '' is Alfred_North_Whitehead .

We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening . Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience . It takes a great_deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one 's world simply as a collection of sense_data arranged in such_and_such sequence and pattern , devoid_of all power to move the feelings and <head>actions</head> except in_so_far as they present themselves for inspection . Whitehead is here questioning David_Hume 's understanding of the nature of experience ; he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from Hume 's presupposition that experience is merely sense_data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived . What Hume calls `` sensation '' is what Whitehead calls `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy '' which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy . As_long_as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense_data , most_of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity , becomes an invention of consciousness , and the result is a philosophical scepticism .</context>

Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato . But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and <head>action</head> must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths . For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in_contrast_to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality . The central concern of Erich_Auerbach 's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved . Following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels , the Christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures '' of divine power and reality .</context>

By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself .

      <context> Another great danger is that the emerging middle_class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political_leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism . The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West . Particularly when based upon a single dominant party , governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest . Convinced of the wisdom of their own <head>actions</head> , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead rigid and inflexible in their policies . American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes . It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies .

It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing_up to the intractable tasks at_home . We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible <head>actions</head> on the world scene . When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold_war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not_only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development .

Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective <head>action</head> among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted . Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social_system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective . In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them - and that with independence free_men do not have_to work to realize the benefits of modern life .</context>

      <context> Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends . This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social Plan with a meaning interpretable in_terms_of ultimate ends ; for_example , a plan that fulfills the will of God , which advances the Kingdom_of_God , which involves social life as part of the Grand Design . This explains some group ends and provides a justification of their primacy . It gives social guidance and direction and makes_for programs of social <head>action</head> . Finally , it gives meaning to much social endeavor , and logic , consistency , and meaning to life . In_general , there is no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired transcendental ends . Religion integrates and unifies .</context>

      <context> The credo unifies and socializes men by attaching them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the firmer the group . The religious symbolism , and especially the closely related rites and worship forms , constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith . The religion , in_fact , is an expression of the unity of the group , small or large . The common codes , for religious <head>action</head> as_such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotees together . These are ways of jointly participating in significantly symbolized , standardized , and ordered religiously sanctified behavior . The codes are mechanism for training in , and directing and enforcing , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group . Durkheim noted long_ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things - unite [ s ] into one single moral community - all those who adhere to them '' .</context>

      <context> As Yinger has pointed_out , the `` reliance on symbols , on tradition , on sacred_writings , on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turns one to the past far more than to the future '' . Historically , religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication , enforcement , sanction , and perpetuation of various other institutions . At_the_same_time that religion exercises a conserving influence , it also energizes and motivates both individuals and groups . Much of the important individual and social <head>action</head> has been owing to religious incentives . The great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon_lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force , mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices ; for_example , the Crusades , mission efforts , just wars . Much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion . The insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating effects .</context>

      <context> Apart from some areas of recurring trouble , like Bani_Mellal , where inexperienced officials had been appointed , there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process . Centrally , however , the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage .

Although the monarch had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance , his <head>action</head> was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor .

A week later the Daily_Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John_Brown on the day of his execution .
