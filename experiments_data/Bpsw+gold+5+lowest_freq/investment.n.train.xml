      <context> So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard_to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation 's needs for survival . The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society . Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society . Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the <head>investment</head> and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by_any_means other_than the corporate form , e._g. constructing major airports or dams . Thus , if corporations are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject_to public control and needs . In all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services . Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human_beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests .</context>

Perhaps a list of some of the `` practices '' of my company will help here . The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles . From an initial investment of $ 1200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital <head>investment</head> , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $ 10000000 ( we do n't disclose financial figures to the public ) . Its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth ; and no limitation is in_evidence .

The system is composed of three credit services , Federal_Land_Banks and National_Farm_Loan_Associations , Federal_Intermediate ( short-term ) Credit_Banks , and Banks_for_Cooperatives .

As a source of <head>investment</head> capital , the system is beneficial to local communities and encourages the development of industries in rural_areas . The credit provdied by the first two services in the system outlined above is primarily for general agricultural purposes .

      <context> The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for <head>investment</head> and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' . 353_U._S._,_at_589 .</context>

      <context> In the fall of 1878 , the `` Popular_Telegraph_Line '' was established between Manchester and Factory_Point by the owners , Paul_W._Orvis , Henry_Gray , J._N._Hard , and Clark_J._Wait . The line soon lived_up_to its name , as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital_stock . In 1879 the same Clark_Wait , with H._H._Holley of South_Dorset , formed the `` American_Telegraph_Line '' , extending from Manchester_Depot via Factory_Point and South_Dorset to Dorset . Besides being most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good <head>investment</head> for the owners '' . Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron_C._Burr and Mark_Manley of `` Burr_and_Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry_goods . Early equipment was very flimsy ; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles , making communications impossible . But companies continued to spring_up .</context>
