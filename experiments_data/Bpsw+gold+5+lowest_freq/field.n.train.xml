      <context> The outlook for the amateur , for_instance , is usually dependent_on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque . His love of folklore has romanticism in it , and he does n't care much about the dollar_sign or the footnote . Folklore is his hobby , and he , all_too rightly , wishes it to remain as such . The amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more_than the amateur who has taken_to the <head>field</head> . The collector enjoys the contact with rural life ; he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream '' reasons that many persons hunt game ; and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located . Fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them do n't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material . But there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts - one dominated_by money , the other by nineteenth century German scholarship .</context>

      <context> Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . The market today for detergent_builders is quite diverse . The best_known <head>field</head> of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up_to 50 % by weight of sodium_tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium_tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium_pyrophosphate . In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; and the dwindling built soap_powders as_well_as soap_flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . A well publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid_detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder / active ratio .</context>

      <context> If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . First , T may not have a single characteristic value ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar_field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed . Second , even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely over F into a product of polynomials of degree 1 , there may not be enough characteristic vectors for T to span the space V ; this is clearly a deficiency in T . The second situation is illustrated by the operator T on * * f ( F any <head>field</head> ) represented in the standard basis by * * f . The characteristic polynomial for A is * * f and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for A ( or for T ) . Thus T is not diagonalizable . One sees that this happens because the null_space of * * f has dimension 1 only .</context>
