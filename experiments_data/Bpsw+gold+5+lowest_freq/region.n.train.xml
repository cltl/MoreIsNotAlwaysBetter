      <context> The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities . I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town . I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in_detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen . And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious_mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental <head>region</head> so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .

      <context> Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South_Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North_Carolina , and Alabama following along after them . Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; so_that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper_limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old_South from the new , but with , of_course , important minority enclaves . The long settled areas of states like Virginia and South_Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater . Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a <head>region</head> such_as the coastal lowlands centering_on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West_Indies than with the North even after independence . The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area . In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old_South .

      <context> Such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ; nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters . One of the early humorists already mentioned , Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials . Thorpe came to Louisiana from the East as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty . But Thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier_settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new <head>regions</head> . As a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on_the_one_hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on_the_other an anecdote of the village of Hardscrabble , Arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano ; and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor , `` The_Big_Bear_of_Arkansas '' , in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature .</context>

      <context> Faulkner 's is not the mind of the apologist which Mr._O'_Donnell implies that it is . He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions - or possibly the regulations - governing his tenure in the post_office at Oxford , Mississippi , thirty-five years ago . That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of_course , that he is steeped in them , in_fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books .

      <context> It would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his family . And , after_all , he has lived comfortably at both Oxford , Mississippi , and Charlottesville , Virginia . The young William_Faulkner in New_Orleans in the 1920 's impressed the novelist Hamilton_Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so . Besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native <head>region</head> even for short periods , and in_addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years . It is more difficult with Faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge . His own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the South , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation .

      <context> However , this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung . The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues . Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , ' 13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , ' 58 ) . Therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial_artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the <head>region</head> of the alveolus . If this be true , the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial_arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema . One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1 , or 2 , .

In distal <head>regions</head> its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary_artery . This vessel could be followed to the parenchyma where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary_bed ( figs. 17 , 18 ) .

      <context> Similarly , higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase . This is not extended to anticipated levels of GNP , however - only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against wage price increases . Finally , since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call_for less_than proportionately larger price increases ( e._g. , if a wage increase of 5 % allows a price increase of 7 % , a wage increase of 10 % allows a price increase of something less_than 14 % ) . We assume that average total unit_cost in the relevant <head>region</head> of operation is constant with_respect_to quantity produced ( the average_cost curve is horizontal , and therefore is identical with the marginal_cost curve ) , and is the same for every firm ( and therefore for the industry ) . The level of this average_cost is determined by factor prices , technology , and_so_forth . As we have noted , however , we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate . The level of average_cost ( equal to marginal_cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate .</context>
