      <context> Niccolò Machiavelli argued strongly for conscription , seeing the professional armies as the <head>cause</head> of the failure of societal unity in Italy . Other proponents , such as William James , consider both mandatory military and national service as ways of instilling maturity in young adults .

      <context> Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in_relation_to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat . When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor - if I have been working on a full sheet in the field . `` When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal . When this linear <head>draft</head> is completed , I dust it down to a faint image . From this point , I paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage . However , first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described . Then I plan my attack : the parts I will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details - all_in_all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness .</context>

So Lolotte - or anybody - could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied_with the missing bottle of opium . That was not reasonable either . The opium had disappeared before Emile 's death and whoever shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen Sarah 's own doubts and suspicions - and questions .</context>
