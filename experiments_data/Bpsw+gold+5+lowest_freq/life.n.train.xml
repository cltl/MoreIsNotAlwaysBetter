      <context> Shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of Shylock , but probably he never saw a Jew , unless in some of his travels . The Jews had been banished from England in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 , when Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years . If any had escaped expulsion by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place . Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays , but borrowed them from old stories , ballads , and plays , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark of <head>life</head> . Rather than from a first-hand study of Jewish people , his delineation of Shylock stems from a collection of Italian stories , Il_Pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier . He could learn at second_hand from books , but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit . Harris_J._Griston , in Shaking_The_Dust_From_Shakespeare ( 216 ) , writes : `` There is not a word spoken by Shylock which one would expect from a real Jew '' .</context>

Max , in a fit of despair , takes Alicia and runs_off for two marvelous weeks in Burbank ( Fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole <head>life</head> '' ) , at the end of which Alicia tragically contracts Parkinson's_disease and dies . This brief resume hardly does the book justice , but I heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major problems of our time . Opera in the Grand_Tradition , along with mah-jongg , seems to be staging a well deserved comeback . In this country , the two guiding_lights are , without_doubt , Felix_Fing and Anna_Pulova .</context>
