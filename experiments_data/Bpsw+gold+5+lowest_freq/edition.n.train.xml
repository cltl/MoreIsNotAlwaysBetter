      <context> The numbering of book editions is a <head>special</head> case of the wider field of revision control . The traditional conventions for numbering book editions evolved spontaneously for several centuries before any greater applied science of revision control became important to humanity , which did not occur until the era of widespread computing had arrived ( when software and electronic publishing came into existence ) . The old and new aspects of book edition numbering ( from before and since the advent of computing ) are discussed below .</context>

      <context> The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration . Your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score . It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high_fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener . The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope since Feyer 's four-sided LP <head>edition</head> of 1958 for Angel ) , this set is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment . The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari 's melodramatic contrasts between ultra vehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality . And in its engineers ' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super high_fidelity '' . The home listener is overpowered , all_right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one .</context>

      <context> Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances . The occasion for this marathon : Angel 's long awaited reissue in its `` Great_Recordings_of_the_Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro_Arte version . Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . Whether considered alone or in_relation_to other <head>editions</head> , COLH 40 is a document of prime importance . Artur_Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable . But Schnabel was a great teacher in_addition_to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford_Curzon , Frank_Glazer , Adrian_Aeschbacher , and Victor_Babin ) also sheds_light_on the master 's pedagogical skills . Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in_that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) .</context>

      <context> The assisting musicians from the Vienna_Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing . ( Special compliments to the double_bass playing of Johann_Krumpp : his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance . ) The Glazer-Fine_Arts <head>edition</head> ( Concert-Disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization . It is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort . But having lived with the disc for some time now , I find the performance less exciting than either Schnabel 's or Fleisher 's ( whose superb performance with the Budapest_Quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good_deal less filled with humor than Curzon 's . Aeschbacher 's work is very_much akin to Schnabel 's , but the sound on his Decca disc is dated , and you will have a hard_time locating a copy of it .</context>

The Hephzibah_Menuhin-Amadeus_Quartet ( Angel ) and Victor_Babin-Festival_Quartet ( RCA_Victor ) <head>editions</head> give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing . ( Babin has acquired some of Schnabel 's keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight . ) Badura-Skoda-Vienna_Konzerthaus ( Westminster ) and Demus-Schubert_Quartet ( Deutsche_Grammophon ) are both warm_toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless . Helmut_Roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth_Ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last_mentioned pianists .</context>

      <context> Mercer is_supposed_to have refused it with , `` Anyone who wears a square monocle must be affected '' ! Everett_Miller , then assistant director for the Garrick_Gaieties , a Theatre_Guild production , needed a lyricist for a song he had written ; he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however . For him Mercer produced the lyric to `` Out_of_Breath_Scared_to_Death_of_You '' , introduced in that most successful of all the Gaieties , by Sterling_Holloway . This 1930 <head>edition</head> also had songs in it by Vernon_Duke and Ira_Gershwin , by E._Y._Harburg and Duke , and by Harry_Myers . Entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged the burgeoning song_writer to take a wife , Elizabeth_Meehan , a dancer in the Gaieties . The Mercers took_up residence in Brooklyn , and Mercer found a regular job in Wall_Street `` misplacing stocks and bonds '' . When he heard that Paul_Whiteman was looking_for singers to replace the Rhythm_Boys , Mercer applied and got the job , `` not for my voice , I 'm sure , but because I could write songs and material generally '' .</context>
