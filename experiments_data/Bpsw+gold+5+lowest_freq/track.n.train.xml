      <context> Continuous <head>track</head> , also called tank tread or caterpillar track , is a system of vehicle propulsion in which a continuous band of treads or track plates is driven by two or more wheels . This band is typically made of modular steel plates in the case of military vehicles and heavy equipment , or synthetic rubber reinforced with steel wires in the case of lighter agricultural or construction vehicles . Continuous tracks can be traced back as far as 1770 and today are commonly used on a variety of vehicles including bulldozers , excavators , tanks , and tractors , but can be found on any vehicle used in an application that can benefit from the added traction , low ground pressure and durability inherent in continuous track propulsion systems .</context>

      <context> As we have already seen in the first chapter , bumblebees are bigger , hairier , and much more colorful than honeybees , exhibiting various combinations of black , yellow , white and orange . Let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them Bombus ; there must be several dozen species in the United_States alone . If you really insist on knowing their names , an excellent book on the North_American species is Bumblebees and Their Ways by O._E._Plath . If we manage to keep <head>track</head> of a Bombus queen after she has left her feeding place , we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed_up for herself when she woke_up from her winter sleep . As befits a queen , a bumblebee female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable nesting_place . Most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such_as a deserted mouse_nest , a bird_house , or the hole made by a woodpecker ; some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss . Once she has made_up_her_mind , the queen starts_out by constructing , in her chosen abode , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some woolly material .</context>
