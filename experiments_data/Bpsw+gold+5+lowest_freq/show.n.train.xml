      <context> Skorich began his new job auspiciously today . At a ceremony in the reception_room of Mayor_Richardson_Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William_A._Bill_Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night 's thirty-eighth annual dinner and <head>show</head> of the New_York Chapter , Baseball_Writers_Association_of_America , at the Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel . Shea , the chairman of Mayor_Wagner_'s_Baseball_Committee , will be joined on the dais by Warren_Spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee_Braves ; Frank_Graham , the Journal-American sports columnist ; Bill_Mazeroski , the World_Series hero of the Pittsburgh_Pirates , and Casey_Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees . Stengel will receive the Ben_Epstein_Good_Guy_Award . Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe_Ruth_Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world_series .</context>

      <context> Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe_Ruth_Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world_series . Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William_J._Slocum_Memorial_Award . To Spahn will go the Sid_Mercer_Memorial_Award as the chapter 's player of the year . A crowd of 1400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the <head>show</head> in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song . The 53 - year old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible_for the imminent return of a National_League club to New_York . Named by Mayor_Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James_A._Farley , Bernard_Gimbel and Clint_Blume , Shea worked relentlessly . His goal was to obtain a National_League team for this city .</context>

      <context> At_least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' , presented on NBC - TV Nov. 26 . The program came_out of the NBC Special Projects department , and was slotted in the Du_Pont_Show of the Week series . Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines . If so , it might be worth_while to assign a future jazz <head>show</head> to a different department - one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut_down on the number of performers and give them a_little room to display their talents . As_a_matter_of_fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results . A_few years ago a `` Timex All Star Jazz Show '' offered a broad range of styles , ranging from Lionel_Hampton 's big_band to the free-wheeling Dukes_of_Dixieland . An enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live '' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance .</context>

About that same time John_Crosby 's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing_space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do . In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods .</context>

( He played host at the Timex <head>show</head> already mentioned . ) One of the script 's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today .

For_example , there was sheet_music with the word `` jazz '' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took_hold .</context>

      <context> Thereafter the audience waxed applause happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization . As she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` Lucia '' . She topped the sextet brilliantly . Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the <head>show</head> midway in the `` Mad_Scene '' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment . Miss_Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene : A much more girlish Lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role . What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as Miss_Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today . This big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined .</context>

An early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo_Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage . In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large_numbers from the simple-minded , one minute <head>shows</head> . In response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion_picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day . Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at_heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short_story . Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .</context>
