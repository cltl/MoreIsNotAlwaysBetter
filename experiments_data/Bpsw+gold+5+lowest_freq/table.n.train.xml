A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more_than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region . Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present . The results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a <head>table</head> of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1000 to 10000 * * f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from * * f to * * f times normal density .

      <context> Obviously , a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in_place_of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil . Substances other_than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases . This is particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall_into the class of polyelectrolytes . Whereas the usual organic surface-active_agent is strongly sorbed at oil-water_interfaces , the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure ( see <head>Table</head> 26 - 2 on p. 1678 ) . Thus , for aqueous media , we can think_of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active_agent , and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active_agent . From the equilibrium sorption data which are available , it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative_charge . The charged particles then repel each other and are also repelled from the charged surface , which almost invariably bears a negative_charge under washing conditions .</context>

      <context> When typical reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated , chlorine and phosgene were produced . Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at * * f . Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical_exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon_tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate . Data on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in <head>Table</head> /1 . . In series /1 , the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm. . The last column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4 ( 14.7 cm. distance ) calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity .</context>

      <context> Zodiacal_light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors . The diurnal_variation in the observed flux may be partly due_to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity . The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data . A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in <head>Table</head> 5 - 1 . From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude . The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density * * f except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar_system in the presence of solar_radiation pressure . The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors .</context>

Note that the mass scale is one to two orders_of_magnitude greater than some previously used ; for_example , Jacchia ( 1948 ) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a * * f , zero magnitude meteorite . The older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic_energy into light . The mass scale used in <head>Table</head> 5 - 1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related_to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 ) . A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 ) . Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites . The approximate equation is * * f , where n is the number of * * f with electron line density greater than or equal to * * f , and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite .</context>

These extrapolated fluxes are about an order_of_magnitude less_than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple 's <head>table</head> . The extrapolation may be in error for several reasons . The observational data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region .

The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested parties , including the government itself , were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections . The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics .</context>

      <context> The Istiqlal sponsored U.M.C.I.A. ( L'Union_Marocaine_des_Commercants , Industrialistes_et_Artisans ) was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P. ( L'Union_National_des_Forces_Populaires ) in nearly all urban_centers . As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen , the U.M.C.I.A. was generally favored against the more progressive , labor based U.N.F.P. The newer party campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small_businessmen to support them as they had done for many years . The local Istiqlal and U.M.C.I.A. offices did not campaign and lost heavily . The value of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as shown in <head>Table</head> /1 , . The chamber_of_Commerce elections were , of_course , an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections . The U.N.F.P. learned that its urban organization , which depends heavily on U.M.T. support , was most effective . The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete , precise problems of internal politics .</context>

      <context> Voter registration began in late November 1959 and continued until early January , 1960 . The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response . Periodic bulletins of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial officials . A goal was fixed , as given in <head>Table</head> 2 , and attention focused_on its fulfillment . The qualifications to vote were kept very simple . Both men and women of twenty-one years of_age could register and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification . There were liberal provisions for dispensation where documents or records were lacking .</context>

      <context> This was equivalent_to 240 mg / l BOD on a 24 - hr basis . The BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision . The BOD in the effluent averaged 58 mg / l , a 76 - per_cent reduction over the 24 - hr period . Examination of the data in <head>Table</head> 1 , shows that a_few samples contributed to raising the effluent BOD . The periods of high effluent BOD occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted . Ice caused the aerator to overload , straining the drive belts . The slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow_down and reduce oxygen transfer as_well_as the mixing of the raw sewage .</context>

Needless to say , the organic load was very low on a volumetric basis , but was 270 lb BOD / day / acre on a surface loading basis . It seems that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system . The flow_rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in <head>Table</head> 1 , . With the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due_to infiltration in open sewers . As construction progresses , the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced . The retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged from 9.8 to 2.6 days , averaging 6.4 days .</context>

      <context> The predomination of free_swimming ciliated_protozoa is indicative_of a high bacterial population . One of the important aspects of_this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator . Routine determinations were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates . The data given in <head>Table</head> 2 , show the routine operation of the aerator . The dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until January 29 , 1961 . An extended cold_spell caused ice to build_up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water . The added resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity .</context>

      <context> It was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and corrected , but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen . A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate . Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover . The rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 - mg / l dissolved oxygen concentration and 10 ` C for various rotor speeds is given in <head>Table</head> 3 , . The maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 mg / l dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lb / day at a maximum rate of 9.3 mg / l / hr . The actual power requirements indicated 2 lb oxygen transfer / hr / hp . The polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per_cent , indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather_than through the surface .</context>
