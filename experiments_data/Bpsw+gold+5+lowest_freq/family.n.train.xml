      <context> For statistical purposes in the United Kingdom , a household is defined as " one person or a <head>group</head> of people who have the accommodation as their only or main residence and for a group , either share at least one meal a day or share the living accommodation , that is , a living room or sitting room " . The United States Census definition similarly turns on " separate living quarters " , i.e. " those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building " A householder in the U.S. census is the " person ( or one of the people ) in whose name the housing unit is owned or rented ( maintained ) ; " if no person qualifies , any adult resident of a housing unit is a householder . The U.S. government formerly used the terms " head of the household " and " head of the family " to describe householders ; beginning in 1980 , these terms were officially dropped from the census and replaced with " householder " .</context>

The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of <head>family</head> breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' .

The two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish . Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum . Oldenburg 's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn_to a wider circle of the town 's learned , such_as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching .</context>

However , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the <head>family</head> is anti-intellectual . And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership . This is not due_to any policy of discrimination on_the_part_of the Northern universities . Quite the contrary , as I can testify from personal experience as a former university president .</context>

      <context> There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and <head>families</head> of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . ) In a mobile society , congregational health depends_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like elements will have_to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .</context>

Some of us might be inclined to argue , in_fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly Southern traits .

And , after_all , he has lived comfortably at both Oxford , Mississippi , and Charlottesville , Virginia . The young William_Faulkner in New_Orleans in the 1920 's impressed the novelist Hamilton_Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so . Besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in_addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years .</context>

When each number of successes x is paired with its probability of occurrence * * f , the set of pairs * * f , is a probability function called a binomial_distribution .

      <context> Flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps , they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait . It was amazing how they had herded together for protection : an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper , rising from the breakfast_table ; a gross boy in his teens , shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; a girl in her twenties , fat and sullen , descending the marble staircase ; then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor . They answered him in monosyllables , nods , occasionally muttering in Greek to one another , awaiting the word from Papa , who restlessly cracked his knuckles , anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst off to the freeway . No , they had n't seen anyone around ; no , they did n't know the Andrus <head>family</head> ; yes , they had read about the case ; yes , they had let some reporters use their phone , but they would no_longer . They offered no opinions , volunteered nothing , betrayed no emotions . Studying them , McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple . The Skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human_beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy .</context>

      <context> Skopas expressed no curiosity over the case , offered no expression of sympathy , made no move to escort McFeeley to the door . All four remained impacted on the sofa until he had left . He had spoken_to Mrs._Emerson the previous day . There remained a <head>family</head> named Kahler , owners of a two story Tudor style house on the south_side of the Andrus home . Their names had not come_up in any discussions with Laura , and he had no idea what they would be like . McFeeley noted the immaculate lawn and gardens : each blade of grass cropped , bright and firm ; each shrub glazed with good_health . The door was answered by a slender man in his sixties - straight_backed , somewhat clerical in manner , wearing rimless glasses .</context>

Galli arrived with his <head>family</head> surgeon , Maestro_Lippi . The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons . He told Argiento to take a bird out of the cage , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood gush into Michelangelo 's injured eye .
