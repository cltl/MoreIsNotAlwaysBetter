By 1974 there was a weekly show of 45 minutes , in 1989 Rund Um , a magazine programme aired its first episode . After the merger of France 2 and France 3 into France Télévisions , France 3 Alsace has financed an Alsatian version of animated series Tintin .</context>

      <context> When a man is laid_to_rest , he is entitled to stay_put . If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand . The appointment of U_Thant of Burma as the U.N.'s Acting Secretary_General - at this writing , the choice appears to be certain - offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends . Mongi_Slim of Tunisia and Frederick_Boland of Ireland were early favorites in_the_running , but <head>France</head> did n't like the former and the Soviet_Union would have none of the latter . With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr._Hammarskjold , U_Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto . What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy . In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers_game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat .</context>

      <context> The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level .

The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and <head>France</head> again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek_out the philosophers as he had on his first journey . In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws_of_nature in German and this was issued in French translation ( Paris , 1813 ) under the title Recherches_sur_l_'_identite_des_forces_chimiques_et_electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists . His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated . Chapter 8 , is entitled `` On_Magnetism '' and in it are included such remarks as , `` One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic_forces with the electrical forces .</context>

He completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor_of_Philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine . He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices . Han 's student days were at_a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in <head>France</head> , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent .

From Go ^ ttingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` The first question asked everywhere is about galvanism .

      <context> fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the nations . But though this characterization in_no_way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of_it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final_Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , <head>France</head> ? Should not everyone have been awakened to_it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard_to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by_no_means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .</context>

      <context> As a writer on the theater , I have paid close attention to the plays . Harold_Clurman is right to say that `` Waiting_for_Godot '' is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of Europe 's present politics , ethic , and common way_of_life '' . Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to . `` Waiting_for_Godot '' sells even better in America than in <head>France</head> . The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America , but it is the consciousness that most `` mature '' societies arrive_at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not strictly practical ends of culture . America is now joining Europe in this `` mature '' phase of development . Whether any of us remain in it long will depend_on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going_on in the countries of Asia and Africa , and also of_course on how long the cold_war remains cold .</context>

      <context> Law became a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking_to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms . Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no_longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed . The old way of doing things , which depended_on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no_longer adequate_to the task . First was the period of codification of existing law : the Code_Napoleon in <head>France</head> and the peculiar codification that , in_fact , resulted from Austin 's restatement and ordering of the Common_Law in England . Codification was followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation , some changing and adjusting the older law , much dealing with entirely new situations . The legislative mills have been grinding ever since , and when its cumbersome processes were no_longer adequate_to the task , a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another , to the executive . Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law .</context>
