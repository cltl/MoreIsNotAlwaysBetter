      <context> Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness - a sort_of peasant dignity - too . It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons . The episode in which Sancho_Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island '' is one of the best in the film . True , the pattern and <head>flow</head> of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a_bit wearisome in the first_half , before Don_Quixote goes to the duke 's court . But strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old_boy . There are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange . Also on the bill at the Fifty-fifth_Street is a nice ten minute color film called `` Sunday_in_Greenwich_Village '' , a tour of the haunts and joints .</context>

      <context> It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wildlife . The amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important . A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use . The quantity of water <head>flow</head> may be critical ; a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer . If the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied . Check the quality of the water . A stream which has all_of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing_through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area .</context>

      <context> Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection . Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought_on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr._Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies . Interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney_General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke_off the <head>flow</head> . But there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and New_York . In each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin 's dictatorship ; in the United_States the initiation of militant anti Communism , with the repentant ex Communist in the vanguard . These trials were properly termed `` political cases '' in_that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences .</context>

      <context> Nakamura ( ' 58 ) , Verloop ( ' 48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ( ' 50 ) , von_Hayek ( ' 53 ) , and Tobin ( ' 52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human_being . Miller ( ' 50 ) is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint . In criticism of the latter 's views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all_of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level . As early as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial_artery <head>flow</head> would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary_artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial_artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary_artery pressure . Berry , Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this . Our own studies in which bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by injecting the bronchial_artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary_artery or vein , and then by injecting the pulmonary_artery and vein afterwards . It is distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence , uninjectable .</context>

      <context> It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made . The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined . However , the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic considerations alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse . The volume and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood <head>flow</head> might be different in the dog than in the horse . Also , interlobular air drifts may be all_but nonexistent in the cow ; probably occur in the horse much_as in the human_being ; and , in contrast are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent ( Van_Allen and Lindskog , ' 31 ) . A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at_present . Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as_well .</context>

      <context> Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid_gland . In the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia , hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity ( Money , Rall and Rawson , 1952 ; Stanbury , Brownell , Riggs , Perinetti , Itoiz , and Del_Castillo , 1954 ) . In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre is about 100 | mg per day . With lower levels , thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood <head>flow</head> enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine . Further , the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction of the thyroid_hormone de-iodinated peripherally . In the presence of a low iodine intake , thyroglobulin labelled in_vivo with * * f is found to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal , the amounts of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced . This appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin .</context>

      <context> These countries must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy . They must in their planning be able to count_on at_least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years . Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go_forward . Capital <head>flows</head> must be coordinated with national needs and planning . Finally , a balance must be effected among project finance , utilization of agricultural surpluses , and general balance_of_payments support . Thus , although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative , and many_of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant , the basic purpose of American economic_policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign_exchange . There remain many political and administrative problems to be solved .</context>

      <context> This operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant , with a slowly increasing load , over a reasonable period_of_time . The pilot plant was equipped with a 3 - hp turbine aerator ( Figure 2 ) . The aerator had a variable speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds . The sewage <head>flow</head> into the treatment plant was metered and continuously recorded on 24 - hr charts . The raw sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents . The effluent was collected through two pipes and discharged to the Blue_River through a surface drainage_ditch . Composite samples were collected at weekly intervals .</context>

      <context> The data indicated that the organic load during the 6 - hr composites was essentially 50 per_cent of the 24 - hr organic load . Grab_samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions . Efforts were made to take the grab_samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6 - hr composite sample . A single 24 - hr composite sample indicated that the sewage <head>flow</head> pattern and characteristics were typical . The BOD of the influent to the pilot plant varied between 110 and 710 mg / l with an average of 350 mg / l . This was equivalent_to 240 mg / l BOD on a 24 - hr basis . The BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision .</context>
