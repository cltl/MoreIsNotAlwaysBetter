Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male - even the Bible appears to endorse the concept .

This carried_over into the more urbanized late 19 th and early 20 th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull_roaring Life_With_Father manner .

      <context> Four or five of the cousins from East_Texas were about his age , so naturally they ran_around together . There was no reason for her to ask what they did . Thus a new pattern of days began to develop , for Granny_Albright did not die . She lay still on the <head>bed</head> , her head hardly denting the pillow ; sometimes she opened her eyes and looked_around , and sometimes she took a_little milk or soup . They stopped expecting her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two . Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go_home , for she might die any time ; but they might as_well unpack their suitcases , for she might linger on . So the pattern was established .</context>

      <context> The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young_man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot_Sands - he of the porch steps anecdotes - who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked_off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them . Like Eliot , in my fantasies , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night 's climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love . The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle - it must have been late in September - I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and bloody , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life . For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in_that imagined <head>bed</head> would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie_awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep . The weeks went_by , and the longer our separation grew , the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became . They caused my love for Jessica to become warmer and at_the_same_time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again . As it turned_out , Jessica took matters into her own hands .</context>
