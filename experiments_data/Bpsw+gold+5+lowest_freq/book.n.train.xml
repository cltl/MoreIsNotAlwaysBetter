      <context> Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call_for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja_vu , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem . As in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain .

The opening paragraph of the chapter titled The_Theory_Of_Representative_Perception , in the <head>book</head> Philosophies_Of_Science by Albert_G._Ramsperger says , `` passed_on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception '' . But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather_than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location . Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness .</context>

At_first_glance this appears strange : of all people , was not America founded by rugged_individualists who established a new way_of_life still inspiring `` undeveloped '' societies abroad ? But hear Harrison_E._Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The_New_York_Times , and author of `` To_Moscow_-_And_Beyond '' . In a <head>book</head> review of `` The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State_Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West_Contacts_Staff in_order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy_and_Bess ' overrode the State_Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz_musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo_montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry_Ford , Hugh_Cooper , Thomas_Campbell , the International_Harvester_Co. , and David_W._Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' .</context>

Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays , but borrowed them from old stories , ballads , and plays , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark of life . Rather than from a first-hand study of Jewish people , his delineation of Shylock stems from a collection of Italian stories , Il_Pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier . He could learn at second_hand from <head>books</head> , but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit . Harris_J._Griston , in Shaking_The_Dust_From_Shakespeare ( 216 ) , writes : `` There is not a word spoken by Shylock which one would expect from a real Jew '' .

      <context> The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at_least since John_Pendleton_Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank_Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature . The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil_War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way_of_life which had been destroyed . As they looked with_nostalgia to a society which had been swept_away , they were probably no_more than half conscious that they painted_in_colors which had never existed . Their <head>books</head> found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp . The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas_Nelson_Page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So_Red_the_Rose , by Stark_Young . Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark_Young 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed .</context>

      <context> The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner 's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil_War . It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his <head>books</head> is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen_Glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society . Faulkner 's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life . They have an ancestry extending back , however , at_least to 1728 , when William_Byrd described the Lubberlanders he encountered in the back_country of Virginia and North_Carolina . The chief literary antecedents of the Snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated_in the South and the Southwest in the three decades before the Civil_War .</context>

      <context> They have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , I believe , in pointing_out Faulkner 's independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the Southern tradition . Faulkner 's is not the mind of the apologist which Mr._O'_Donnell implies that it is . He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions - or possibly the regulations - governing his tenure in the post_office at Oxford , Mississippi , thirty-five years ago . That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of_course , that he is steeped in them , in_fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his <head>books</head> . It is to say rather , I believe , that he has brought_to_bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind - the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique . He has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern . The fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern , I rather think , for the South has been no_more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity .</context>

      <context> Moreover , it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial impetus to Plato 's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods , wives , and children , was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche ; and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns . In More 's Utopia communism is not a means of separating_out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass . Utopian communism applies to all Utopians . And in the economy of the <head>book</head> it is not peripheral but central . The concern of Utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu , the best ordering of a civil society ; and it is again_and_again made clear that Utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensable to that best ordering . To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors in spirit , the monastic communities , is with an appropriate shift of adjectives , misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato 's Republic : in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes , in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes .</context>

      <context> Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century .

More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone - because he wrote Utopia . And the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that <head>book</head> for the past century or_so . Only one other contemporary of More 's evokes so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work - Niccolo_Machiavelli and The_Prince .
