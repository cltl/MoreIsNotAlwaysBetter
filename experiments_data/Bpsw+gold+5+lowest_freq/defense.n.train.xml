      <context> An ego defence mechanism becomes pathological only when its <head>persistent</head> use leads to maladaptive behaviour such that the physical or mental health of the individual is adversely affected . The purpose of ego defence mechanisms is to protect the mind/self/ego from anxiety and/or social sanctions and/or to provide a refuge from a situation with which one can not currently cope . One resource used to evaluate these mechanisms is the Defense Style Questionnaire ( DSQ-40 ) .</context>

      <context> `` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right_away '' , said Stram , quipping , `` I think I 'll put that play in the book '' . The early Southwest_Conference football leaders - Texas , Arkansas and Texas_A+M - made a big dent in the statistics last week . Texas ' 545 - yard spree against Washington_State gave the Longhorns a 3 - game total offense of 1512 yards ( 1065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high . Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough <head>defense</head> to whip TCU , and A+M , with a 38 - point bulge against Texas_Tech ran_up its biggest total loop play since 1950 . Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards . Texas leads in per game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor 's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas ' 189 ) . A+M has the best defense against passes , 34.7 yards per game .</context>

      <context> Public_relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried_out : Too_much , too_much - the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had_to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most_of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing_on the corpus_delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject_to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs . Counsel for the <head>defense</head> , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection . Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought_on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr._Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies . Interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney_General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke_off the flow .</context>

      <context> I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets . Along the main thoroughfares hardly_a house had not been peppered . In place of the police_headquarters was a new square filled with rubble . Mortars had demolished the <head>defense</head> ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next_door . What had been the ambassador 's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick . This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane , fought less_than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( December 9 - 11 , 1960 ) . And now , in March , all Laos suffered a state of siege .</context>

      <context> Although the Taylor_Scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items . The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . The two ratings yield a correlation of + .04 , which is not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics . In_theory , compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive <head>defenses</head> are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer . The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken_up later . In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress , and the children 's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years . In establishing criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself .</context>
