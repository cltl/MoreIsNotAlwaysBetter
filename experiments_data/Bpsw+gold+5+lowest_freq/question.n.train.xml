      <context> Dallas may get_to hear a debate on horse_race parimutuels soon between Reps._V._E._Red_Berry and Joe_Ratcliff .

      <context> It is true , that nothing has been found comparable_with electricity by communication ; but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending_on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference . The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form . There , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism . But in such an important <head>question</head> , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to_it . One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do . It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb . By that , one feels that magnetic_forces are as general as electrical forces .</context>

      <context> It is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand . The reason and the day of `` grandfather_clauses '' has long_since passed . No one can deny that these `` back_door '' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies . Beyond any <head>question</head> of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves . It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students . The local decorator who rushes in for a_few hours of teaching may but more likely may_not have these qualifications . Nor will the hack , the Jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art_schools , suffice .</context>

      <context> It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and_so_on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior_design , as are the art_teachers educated in the academic subjects . The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only_if this standard is observed . The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken_into_account . One technical <head>question</head> of school organization comes_to_mind here . For proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at_least one level above that for which the student is a candidate . Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior_design this rule cannot at_present be observed . Indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at_all .</context>

      <context> Most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers . One solution is the acquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute . It is a sort_of academic ring-around-a_rosy and you solve it . This brings us to the <head>question</head> of accreditation of art_schools in_general . Only the independent art_schools , that_is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations . It has been the custom for most universities to stretch_the_blanket of accreditation for their liberal_arts school to cover_the_shivering_body of their fine_arts department . This , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior_design to the many subjects of their home_economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior_design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior_design .</context>

      <context> Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior_designer does know all this and does practice it . And further he must understand his obligation to the client to not_only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society . Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum . It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a <head>question</head> may arise . The old established independent art_schools try their best to fulfill their obligations . Yet even here many_a problem is presented ; as in a recent design competition with a floor_plan and the simple command - `` design a luxury apartment '' ; no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical_area or local social necessities - simply `` a luxury apartment '' . Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show_pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public_relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior_design .</context>

      <context> One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages . Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell_into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism . Yes , he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of_course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; but he believed in the Jew as enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things . The real <head>question</head> was how one passed from anti-Semitism of_this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . In regard_to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of_this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light_mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' .</context>

      <context> This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human_beings typically do - namely , by taking steps to end_up on what appears to be the winning side . To the extent , then , that declining U._S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern . Still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet_Union and ourselves . Here I do not speak_of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power - of influence , if you will - about which the relevant <head>questions</head> are : Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ? And is Western influence greater or less than it used to be ? In answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded :</context>

      <context> Justice is a worthy objective ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union_of_South_Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer . Prosperity is a worthy objective ; but if providing higher standards_of_living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made . It may be , of_course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in_favor_of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of Soviet Communist power . This much having been said , the <head>question</head> remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used . This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power . I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be . And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free_world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously .</context>

      <context> Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation . In a rapidly changing society congregations will run_into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more_than a single generation . The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of_this struggle to maintain economic balance . The expense of_this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental <head>questions</head> about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development . It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends - expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings . These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis . Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions .</context>

      <context> This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members . The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations . There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . A crucial <head>question</head> , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . )</context>

      <context> Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared . The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it . In_fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in_this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears . In_fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered <head>questions</head> arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty . Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease . The situation with regard_to our attitude and `` control '' of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with_respect_to people . The fear of disease was formerly very_much the kind of fear I have tried to describe .</context>

The purpose of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories given below : Dirt , which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties . Greasy soils , which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats ( esters of glycerol with long chain organic acids ) .</context>

      <context> The threshold mass of about * * f corresponds to a 10 - | m diameter sphere of density * * f . However , the conversion from mass to size is unreliable , since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as * * f . To_what_extent such low_density applies to micrometeorites is unknown . The velocity value used is also open_to some <head>question</head> ; if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the Earth , only about one_third the above_mentioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass . Zodiacal_light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors . The diurnal_variation in the observed flux may be partly due_to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity . The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data .</context>

      <context> Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression , that which seems best to give release , and communicational expression , to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter . It is no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient , the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients , shows , as one of his characteristic symptoms , laughter - laughter which now makes one feel scorned or hated , which now makes one feel_like weeping , or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man 's despair ; and which , more often than all these , conveys a welter of feelings which could in_no_way be conveyed by any number of words , words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another . To a much less full extent , the hebephrenic person 's belching or flatus has a comparable communicative function ; in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at_least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch , or the passage of flatus , not_only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze , but also because he learns that even these animal like sounds constitute forms of communication in which , from_time_to_time , quite different things are being said , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings and concepts , to say them in words . As I have been intimating , in the schizophrenic - and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic ; this is a <head>question</head> which I have no wish to take_up - condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well sorted_out , but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well differentiated from one another . Freeman , Cameron and McGhie , in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard_to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation '' . In my experience , a great many_of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience . Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene .</context>

On the positivist theory , everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second .

And our <head>question</head> is , is such an implication consistent with what we meant ? Clearly it is not . If anyone asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at_all , we should say that it made all the difference in_the_world , that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our assertion was in that case mistaken . The suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after_all making no mistake , because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering , seems to me merely frivolous .</context>
