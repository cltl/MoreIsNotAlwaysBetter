      <context> A typical `` sonogram '' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in Fig. 5 . The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc. and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter . The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90 - degree arc in_front_of the eye to `` look_into '' all corners . The total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90 - degree rotation <head>period</head> . Drs._Howry and Holmes at the University_of_Colorado_Medical_School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results . By submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes_on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in Fig. 7 , as_well_as many other hitherto impossible insights . As mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig. 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center .</context>

      <context> The tsunami warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander_C._K._Green of the Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey staff . It consists_of a series of pipes and a pressure measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface . Ordinary water tides are disregarded . But when waves with a <head>period</head> of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set_in_motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric_circuit . This in_turn sets_off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress . Such equipment has been installed at Hilo , Midway , Attu and Dutch_Harbor . The moment the alarm goes_off , information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu , which is the center of the warning system .</context>
