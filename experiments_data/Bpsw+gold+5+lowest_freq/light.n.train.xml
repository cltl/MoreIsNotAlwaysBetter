      <context> The first lighters were converted flintlock pistols that used gunpowder . One of the first lighters was invented by the German chemist named Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner in 1823 and was often called Döbereiner 's lamp . This lighter worked <head>by</head> passing flammable hydrogen gas , produced within the lighter by a chemical reaction , over a platinum metal catalyst which in turn caused it to ignite and give off a great amount of heat and light .</context>

      <context> In analyzing the watercolors of Roy_Mason , the first thing that comes_to_mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate . Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with <head>lights</head> ; a middle_distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .</context>

      <context> Inspiring - yes ; instructive - maybe ; duplicable - no ! But for the technical fact , we have the artist 's own testimony : `` Of_late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors . First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately * * f inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values - the lightest <head>light</head> , the middle tone , and the darkest dark - by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns . If a human figure or wild_life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch . For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose . `` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .</context>

      <context> The inner life of congregations will prosper so_long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; the outer life of congregations - the suitability of the environment to their survival - will be propitious so_long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership . Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation . In a rapidly changing society congregations will run_into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more_than a single generation . The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the <head>light</head> of_this struggle to maintain economic balance . The expense of_this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development . It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends - expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings . These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis .</context>

      <context> For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people . Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes . But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides . We have ample <head>light</head> when the sun sets ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; the range of our voice ignores distance .

      <context> the crude sketch of Piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of , for_instance , Naphta and Leverku^hn . In method as_well_as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism '' , anticipates a kind of musical_composition , as_well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as Leverku^hn says , `` there shall be nothing unthematic '' . It resembles , too , pictures such_as Du^rer and Bruegel did , in which all that looks at_first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for_example , or a deadly_sin . `` Gladius_Dei '' ( 1902 ) resembles `` The_Way_to_the_Churchyard '' in its representation of a conflict between <head>light</head> and dark , between `` Life '' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict . The monk Savonarola , brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn_of_the_century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art shop of M._Bluthenzweig ; in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according_to gossip , upon the painter 's mistress . Hieronymus , like Piepsam , makes his protest quite in_vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating ; he is simply thrown_out of the shop by the porter . On the street outside , Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence , and prophetically he issues his curse : `` Gladius_Dei super terram cito et velociter '' .</context>

His father was a good friend of Rabbi_Szold , and Joe lived with the Szolds for_a_while . Both these youths , who greatly admired Henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring Friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine ; and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with Papa , whose mind - although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser <head>lights</head> with it - naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were . Besides , Miss_Henrietta - as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back - had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; so Cyrus_Adler became interested in her friend Racie_Friedenwald , and Joe_Jastrow - the only young_man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta , and signed himself Joe - fell_in_love with pretty sister Rachel . Henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe 's older and more serious brother , Morris , who was just_about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa , when he substituted for Rabbi_Jastrow at Rodeph_Shalom_Temple there during its Rabbi 's absence in Europe . Young Morris , who , while attending the University_of_Pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write Henrietta twenty page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of Sarah_Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` Sulamith '' on the Jewish reform_movement being promulgated by the Hebrew_Union_College in Cincinnati .</context>
