      <context> If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find . Perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare_state in England still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics . Anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions . One is an imperial <head>London</head> stockbroker called Jerebohm . Another is a wily countryman called Larkin , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled , I believe , in earlier volumes of Mr._Bates ' comedie_humaine . What 's up now ? Well , Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities .</context>

No reference is made to the possibility of recording other_than popular_music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious_music . Directionality is greatly exaggerated most_of the time ; but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music .</context>

      <context> The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy . The twenty-five year old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet . There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is_due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs . Turning_to the more modern versions , Curzon 's ( <head>London</head> ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work . Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought_out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout . Some of Curzon 's playing strikes me as finicky , however . Why , for_example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ?</context>

The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship . He thereupon went to <head>London</head> and spent the winter talking to men of wealth . By springtime , he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry , Prince_of_Wales .

      <context> The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought_in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain_from trading in furs . Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort_Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs . In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per_cent duty on imports via Hudson's_Bay which were viewed_as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' . To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company 's local officials asked that its <head>London</head> authorities refrain_from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . With their customary source of supply cut_off , the Fort_Garry free_traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country . Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St._Paul and goods from St._Paul to Red_River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement . This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per_cent after February 1835 , but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per_cent on the initiative of the London committee .</context>

      <context> Here I do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion . I mean something more like Freud 's concept of the utility of `` play '' to a small child : he plays `` house '' or `` doctor '' or `` fireman '' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control . There is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time . In B._M._Spinley 's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of <head>London</head> , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience . Perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation . Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean . It is at_least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as_well_as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature .</context>
