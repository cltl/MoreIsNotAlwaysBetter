      <context> A <head>pin</head> shackle is closed with an anchor bolt and cotter pin , in a manner similar to a clevis . It is for this reason they are often referred to , in industrial jargon , as clevises . Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with , at times , as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss , usually with a split pin or seizing wire .</context>

      <context> There was good_fortune and there was bad and Philip_Spencer , in handcuffs and ankle irons , knew it to be a truth . He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune . The red haired captain , towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority , was shocked to find himself looking with_sympathy upon Philip_Spencer . This tragic lad had forged his own <head>shackles</head> . But he could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him . And because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the red haired captain , they would be each other 's undoing . `` Spencer , if there is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent ?</context>

      <context> The boatswain was as guilty as any . No action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen , prior to their knowing the significance of the Greek paper , had seen it in Cromwell 's hands while Spencer whispered explanations . `` I thought '' , Midshipman_Rogers had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry '' . It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in <head>shackles</head> to the wardroom , where a class of apprentices awaited him . This was a training_ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which Alexander recognized . Some of these apprentices were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were Spencer 's followers .</context>
