      <context> Other methods will be described below . The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting_buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity , regardless of the blood_group of the donor . With either of the gradients described , chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated agglutinins of the ABO series into at_least three regions ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) : one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic binding capacity and <head>one</head> of high anionic binding capacity . These have been labeled Regions 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in Fig. 1 . When the early part of the gradient was flattened , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` cone sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P._J. and R._S. , Fig. 1 and E._M. , Fig. 2 ) . The latter procedure gave_rise to a small active protein peak ( Region 1a ) between Regions 1 and 2 .</context>
