      <context> The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' . 353_U._S._,_at_589 . Thus , a <head>finding</head> of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision . Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du_Pont and General_Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute .</context>

      <context> We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints . The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition '' . 353_U._S._,_at_607 . On the basis of the <head>findings</head> which led to this conclusion , the Court remanded the case to the District_Court to determine the appropriate relief . The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed to it was this : `` The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the District_Court for a determination , after further hearing , of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute . The District_Courts , in the framing of equitable decrees , are clothed ' with large discretion to model their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case ' .

      <context> It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing_officer 's notes were furnished to the appeal board . Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board . Petitioner knew that the Department 's recommendation was based not on the hearing_officer 's report but on the statement of the local board in his file . Having had every opportunity to rebut the <head>finding</head> of the local board before both the hearing_officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due_process because he did not succeed . It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing_officer 's report and notes at the trial . In_addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes . While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process .</context>

      <context> For_example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related_to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such_as those found in types 1 , and 3 , . One might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse . In_addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog . Anatomically , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our <head>findings</head> in the horse with those of others ( Birnbaum , ' 54 ) in the human_being . The only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard_to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries . As early as 1858 , Le_Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries in human_beings . In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz .</context>

      <context> Nakamura ( ' 58 ) was unable to demonstrate their existence , either by anatomic or physiologic methods , in dogs . The possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is species dependent is therefore inferred . Certainly , the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species . It is , however , highly suggestive and agrees well with our own <head>findings</head> in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery shunts in certain species , especially the dog . In_conclusion , these findings suggest the need for a comparative physiology , pathology , and histology of mammalian lungs . In_addition , a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary_emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent . Also , for the present , great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man .</context>
