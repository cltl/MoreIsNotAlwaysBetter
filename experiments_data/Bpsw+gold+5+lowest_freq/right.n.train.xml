      <context> Nelson , Campbell , and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy <head>correlated</head> with language abilities in toddlers . In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18â€“24 months . What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy ( such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in , or grasping random objects with the left hand ) , it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler .</context>

      <context> Handedness is a better ( faster or more precise ) performance or individual preference for use of a hand , known as the dominant hand . Handedness <head>is</head> not a discrete variable ( right or left ) , but a continuous one that can be expressed at levels between strong left and strong right .</context>

      <context> From the 1830s to the 1880s , <head>there</head> was a shift in the Western world of social class structure and the economy , moving away from nobility and aristocracy towards capitalism . This general economic shift toward capitalism affected centre right movements such as the British Conservative Party , which responded by becoming supportive of capitalism . In British politics , the terms ' right ' and ' left ' came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the Spanish Civil War .</context>

The sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that does n't pause long in any one place , and they are devised so_that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness . ( Several times recently I have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted <head>right</head> in_front_of their eyes .

      <context> However much we may have to criticize liberal theology 's constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it . In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann 's attempt to formulate such a theology has led . For we have said , in_effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative . If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` <head>right</head> '' is clearly untenable . Whereas Bultmann 's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl_Barth , involves the rejection or at_least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered . It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology .

      <context> Hence , if what is in_question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a_little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded . Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on_the_one_hand , by the two at_least apparently self-consistent but mutually_exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on_the_other_hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann . A second point requires more extended comment . It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` <head>right</head> '' , as represented by Barth , rests_on the following thesis : The only tenable alternative to Bultmann 's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at_least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus_Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann 's point_of_view , are mythological .</context>
