      <context> This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more_or_less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek_by_jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928_-_29 '' . However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever . O_'_Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican <head>deal</head> . On Election_Day - November 4 - he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes . The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates . This further demonstration of O_'_Banion 's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone .</context>
