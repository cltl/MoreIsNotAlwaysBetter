      <context> What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged_to it have been profoundly in_earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern_world . Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity . They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked_upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him . When we say , then , that today , in our <head>situation</head> , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at_least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement . However much we may have to criticize liberal theology 's constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it . In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann 's attempt to formulate such a theology has led . For we have said , in_effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative .</context>

      <context> If Bultmann 's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant . Nor is it necessary to look_for such evidence in the great urban_centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated . On_the_contrary , even in the heart of `` the Bible_belt '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological_revolutions have long been under_way , together with the corresponding changes in man 's picture of himself and his world . In_fact , it is in just such a <head>situation</head> that the profundity of Bultmann 's argument is disclosed . Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence . This is especially in_evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle_class . Time_and_again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern_world are only_too painfully obvious .</context>

This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman_Vincent_Peale 's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel . But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most_of the pundits seem to have suspected . However , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at_least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace .</context>

      <context> I have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in_the_air . For_example , a writer in a recent number of The_Queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un English '' ' . In this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics , priests and laity , in England , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics , especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good . One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken_place since the mid 19th century is the <head>situation</head> of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge_Universities . At Oxford one_hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 . Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs . Now , not_only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious_orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non_Catholic members of the University .</context>

      <context> Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers . Despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before - traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer . Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : Has the probable price <head>situation</head> in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? Have you actually checked_out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ? Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions .</context>

      <context> The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community . Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high_school described in my first report . The separate vocational or technical high_schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions . By_and_large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment <head>situation</head> and to the realities of the apprentice system . It is not often realized to_what_degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few .

      <context> The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . ) In a mobile society , congregational health depends_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like elements will have_to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the <head>situation</head> . In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per_cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' . If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 per_cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact . On the surface , this seems a sound approach to Christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care_for new people ; the new people respond in_kind by joining the church .</context>

      <context> Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties .

Regardless_of rights and wrongs , a population and an area appropriate to a pre World_War_I , great_power have been , following conquest , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike .

They are in_general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual . They include both individual fears and collective ones . They arise in <head>situations</head> in which one believes that what happens depends not_only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group . Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized . Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act . To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .</context>

When I try to work_out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , I come_up with the following ideas , which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay . Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann 's heroes . The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns_on a <head>situation</head> in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love . The release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or_else absolutely impossible ; and the motion toward it brings disaster . This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ; it is particularly the artist ( Tonio_Kro^ger , Aschenbach , Leverku^hn ) who suffers from it .

Another great danger is that the emerging middle_class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political_leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism . The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West .

Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications .

He was to get involved in no arguments ; he was to try to make no converts ; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard . It was a ridiculous <head>situation</head> and Rector knew it , for Hino , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage_agent . If he wanted to know anything , he would end_up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection . In all of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino . From the moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job , any job - his qualifications neatly written on a piece_of_paper in a precise hand - he had been ready to become a Christian .</context>
