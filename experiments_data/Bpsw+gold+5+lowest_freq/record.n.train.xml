      <context> I can't throw . Suddenly my reflexes are gone . Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . And so it was over the weekend what with 40 - year old Warren_Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants ' Willie_Mays retaliating with a <head>record</head> tying 4 - homer spree Sunday . Both , of_course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . It was a real stimulant to a_lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2 - score year milestone .</context>

      <context> In_addition , the SBA uses such criteria as number of employees and dollar_volume of the business . The credit requirements stipulate that the applicant must have the ability to operate the business successfully and have enough capital in the business so that , with loan assistance from the SBA , it will be able to operate on a sound financial basis . A proposed loan must be for sound purposes or sufficiently secured so_as to assure a reasonable chance of repayment . The <head>record</head> of past earnings and prospects for the future must indicate it has the ability to repay the loan out of current and anticipated income . The amount which may be borrowed from the SBA depends_on how much is required to carry_out the intended purpose of the loan . The maximum loan which SBA may make to any one borrower is $ 350000 . Business loans generally are repayable in regular installments - usually monthly , including interest at the rate of 5 - 1/2 percent per_annum on the unpaid balance - and have a maximum maturity of 10 years ; the term of loans for working_capital is 6 years .</context>
