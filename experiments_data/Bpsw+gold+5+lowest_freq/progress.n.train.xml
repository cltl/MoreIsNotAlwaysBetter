      <context> Demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual_beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars . In such a world the words `` matter '' and `` spirit '' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all . In it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in_general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously . The <head>progress</head> of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit_world of the entities which previously populated it . In carrying_out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit . The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support . Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time .</context>

      <context> That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' . One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite . Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy . The London_Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping_out various aspects of Catholic <head>progress</head> during the last one_hundred years . With traditional nationalistic spirit , some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best .

      <context> In September 1817 at Fort_Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of Sioux , he escorted to Prairie_du_Chien . During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United_States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red_River and that the United_States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England . Upon arriving_at Baltimore , Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John_Quincy_Adams , Secretary_of_State at Washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois_Territories '' . This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at_first , would increase with the <head>progress</head> of our Settlements '' . The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop_into a trade_route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected . In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the Forks '' ( Fort_Douglas ) and in December 1819 , twenty men left Fort_Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie_du_Chien . It was a three month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats .</context>

Dr._A._V._Astin , NBS_Director , opened the 5 - day session with introductory remarks , following which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week by NBS scientists , from both the Washington and Boulder_Laboratories . In_addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards , spectroscopy , solid_state physics , interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological <head>progress</head> , the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics . The programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared , the application of infrared techniques to solid_state studies , and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation . Two data centers have been established for the collection , indexing , critical evaluation , and dissemination of bibliographies and critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision cross_sections .

This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons_systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_systems which have been overtaken by events . Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated . For_example , the importance of the Regulus_2 , , a very promising aerodynamic ship to surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic_missile launched by submerged submarines .</context>

The substantial <head>progress</head> being made in ballistic_missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles . Considering the high cost of the F-108 system - over $ 4 billion for the force that had been planned - and the time_period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project . Meanwhile , other air_defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message . The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans .</context>

      <context> It may be assumed that differences in ratings due_to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according_to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body . Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence . It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as_well_as Hand , it seems to be the method_of_choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental <head>progress</head> during childhood . As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions - particularly the former - provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period . Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress .
