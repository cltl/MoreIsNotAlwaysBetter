      <context> A case of some merchandise is a collection of items packaged together . In the <head>United</head> States , typically a standard case contains a certain number of items depending on what the merchandise is . For consumer foodstuffs such as canned goods , soda , cereal and such , a case is typically 24 items , however cases may range from 12 to 36 , typically in multiples of six .</context>

By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that <head>case</head> , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection .

But before discussing it , I should_like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their <head>case</head> . It has been said of John_Stuart_Mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found_out . This theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind , and this I will do my best to supply . The theory claims to show by analysis that when we say , `` That is good '' , we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking .</context>

It was amazing how they had herded together for protection : an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper , rising from the breakfast_table ; a gross boy in his teens , shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; a girl in her twenties , fat and sullen , descending the marble staircase ; then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor . They answered him in monosyllables , nods , occasionally muttering in Greek to one another , awaiting the word from Papa , who restlessly cracked his knuckles , anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst off to the freeway . No , they had n't seen anyone around ; no , they did n't know the Andrus family ; yes , they had read about the <head>case</head> ; yes , they had let some reporters use their phone , but they would no_longer . They offered no opinions , volunteered nothing , betrayed no emotions . Studying them , McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple .
