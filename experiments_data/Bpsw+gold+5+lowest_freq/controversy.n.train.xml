In addition to setting out the scope of the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary , it also prohibits courts from issuing advisory opinions , or from hearing cases that are either unripe , meaning that the controversy has not arisen yet , or moot , meaning that the controversy has already been resolved .</context>

The former county school_superintendent , George_P._Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school_board .

      <context> This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter . Modern man , as Dietrich_Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come_of_age '' ; and though this process by_no_means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in_fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it . In_any_event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at_all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen_fit to place us . To say this , of_course , is to take_up a position on one side of a <head>controversy</head> going_on now for some two hundred years , or , at_any_rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought . We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at_least , Bultmann . It is to this same tradition that most_of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong . For we must number here not_only the names of Bushnell , Clarke , and Rauschenbusch , not_to_mention those of `` the Chicago_School '' and Macintosh , but those of the brothers Niebuhr and ( if America may claim him ! )</context>

      <context> The <head>controversy</head> of the last few years over whether architects or interior_designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference_of_opinion . The architects do not believe that the education of the interior_designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round_tables , workshops or panel_discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled_down crux_of_the_matter is education . It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more .</context>

The peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across_the_nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy . In New_York_City in 1958 , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive_device . He thereby precipitated a bitter <head>controversy</head> involving Protestants , Jews and Roman_Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy . A year later in Albany , N._Y. , a Roman_Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned_Parenthood_Association . Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious_belief and conscience . These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue .</context>

It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries . Where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment .</context>

      <context> The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances . A third aspect , and probably the one open_to most <head>controversy</head> , is the results of the election . The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested parties , including the government itself , were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections . The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics . Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence .</context>
