Freud probably contributed more_than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation_Of_Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic <head>power</head> of dreams '' .

      <context> Rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings . Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85 ` in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation_energy and the effect of light intensity . In all cases there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination . By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation_energies ranging from 11 to 18 * * f was observed while dependence on the first <head>power</head> of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases . It was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of reduction of a uranyl_oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions based on the differences in the absorption_spectra of uranyl_oxalate and of chlorine , and considering the spectral distribution of the light source . These estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon_tetrachloride at 65 ` is of the order_of_magnitude of unity . When typical reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated , chlorine and phosgene were produced .</context>

      <context> The day-to-day rate varied by less_than a factor of 4.5 . The data have not_yet been analyzed for diurnal_variations . Note that the mass threshold is four_times that of 1958_Alpha and that the flux is one_fifth as large . If one assumes that the average flux did not change between measurements , a mass distribution curve is obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius to the inverse 7 2 <head>power</head> of the radius . Space_probes have yielded little information . Pioneer_1 , recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours . With detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a_few counts , the second and third Russian space_probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less_than that of larger ones .</context>

      <context> A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 ) . Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites . The approximate equation is * * f , where n is the number of * * f with electron line density greater than or equal to * * f , and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite . Therefore , n is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and in fair agreement with the inverse 7 2 <head>power</head> derived from 1958_Alpha and 1959_Eta data . At the fifteenth magnitude , * * f , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude , * * f . These extrapolated fluxes are about an order_of_magnitude less_than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple 's table . The extrapolation may be in error for several reasons .</context>

      <context> Man is first religious ; the instrumentalities follow . Religion seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence . The significant things in it , at the higher religious levels , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of self-preservation , self pacification , and self completion . The chief experience is the sensing of communion , and in the higher religions , of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural <head>power</head> . Related_to this is the fact that most_of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered , dependable universe .

      <context> To light industry , the economies of being on one floor are much slighter , but efficiency_engineers usually believe_in them , and manufacturers looking_for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning_to efficiency_engineers . This movement of industry away from the central_cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe . It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities . The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities - the rubber factories in Akron , Chrysler 's Detroit plants , U._S._Steel 's Pittsburgh works - often began on these sites at_a_time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( piers ) and <head>power</head> ( river ) . The `` leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam_turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not_yet blighted . The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in selecting his plant site . Until internal_combustion became cheap , he had_to be near a railroad_siding and a trolley_line or an existing large community of lower-class homes .</context>

      <context> `` Comment '' ? ejaculated the surprised woman , looking at Alex for an explanation but he , parting from her without ceremony , only offered a_few words about the doctor 's provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought_on by the demands of his work . With_that he hurried up_the_stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze . When Alex entered his room , the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case , six eggs ready for the hen 's attentions . There was no reference to the incident on the stairs , his <head>powers</head> being absorbed by this more immediate business . The hen appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle_down to the performance of them . One part of her audience was totally engaged , the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the connoisseur , attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in_that which he does not fully understand . The spectacle progressed towards a denouement which was obviously still remote ; the audience attended .</context>

A knocking at Alex 's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning . It was the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in_haste . The doctor stood about , waiting for Alex to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the still dark hallways , past the bedroom of the patronne , and so into the street .</context>
