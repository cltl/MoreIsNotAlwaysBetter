      <context> It is also known as Operating <head>Profit</head> Before Interest and Taxes ( OPBIT ) or simply Profit Before Interest and Taxes ( PBIT ) . Earnings After Tax/ Net Profit After Tax equal sales revenue after deducting all expenses , including taxes ( unless some distinction about the treatment of extraordinary expenses is made ) . In the US , the term Net Income is commonly used .</context>

      <context> Alexander_the_Great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at_once . As time has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military_vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range and breadth of message sending has increased . Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision_making , network structure seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network has value . On the parade_ground the <head>net</head> may be similar to that shown in Figure 3 . The monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence . No questions , statements , or explanations are permitted - only commands . Commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower_rank .</context>

      <context> A further regulation is that commands always go_down , unaccompanied by statements , and statements always go_up , unaccompanied by commands . Questions and , particularly , exclamations are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor . It will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the networks in_vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice . Furthermore , the network in Figure 3 is only the basic <head>net</head> through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the_like are interlaced . Not discussed here are some military problems of modern_times such_as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision_making are not the bottlenecks . Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain_forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach . This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for_example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry .</context>

      <context> Presumably a cocktail_party is expected to fulfill the host 's desire to get_together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors . The party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another . The information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air_waves , and is received by the ears . Since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the <head>net</head> . As shown in Figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points . This , and other qualifications , make the cocktail_party the most complete and most chaotic communication_system ever dreamed_up . All four types of message listed in Table 1 are permitted , although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum , while exclamations having complimentary intonations are more_than customarily encouraged .</context>
