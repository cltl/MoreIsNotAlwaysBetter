      <context> 2 . Heat transfer by molecular conduction as_well_as by radiation from the arc column . The heat transfer to the anode in free_burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas_jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up **f . This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated in_detail by Maecker ( <head>Ref.</head> 1 ) . The pressure gradient producing the jet is_due to the nature of the magnetic_field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) . Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free_burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point . it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free_burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode .</context>

Gas injection through a porous anode ( transpiration cooling ) not_only feeds_back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself .

      <context> The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 ) . Whether this abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH , or is , alternatively , normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible_for the blood activity with pituitary TSH . In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them . The introduction of the United_States_Pharmacopoeia <head>reference</head> standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid stimulating activity have made_it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time .
