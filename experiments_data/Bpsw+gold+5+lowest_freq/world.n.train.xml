The deepest underwater location is Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of 10,911.4 m.</context>

More_than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho_Panza , in seventeenth century Spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . Nikolai_Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander_Nevsky and Ivan_the_Terrible , performs the lanky Don_Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . His addle-brained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no_doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a <head>world</head> of cynics , hypocrites and rogues . Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do . He treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect .

Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time . When , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the <head>world</head> of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality . In doing so science has unquestionably cleared_up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions . There have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful . All this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing .</context>

Instead , the audience can sit_back at_ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no_longer believes_in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion . A teenage girl , Abigail_Williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the Reverend_Samuel_Parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings . For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon <head>world</head> is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air . As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .

It is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with Abigail and Parris , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it .</context>

      <context> To_be_sure , when this is pointed_out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from Paul 's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of First_Corinthians . But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indignation ? Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking_about the same thing ? Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the <head>world</head> must become increasingly precarious ? There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world . by analogy , the church also has been regarded_as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in_order to be the church . But , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a_fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God 's providence , presents it .</context>

      <context> The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members . The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations . There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the <head>world</head> for the healing of the world . A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation .</context>

      <context> I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand_out quite clearly . They are in_general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual . They include both individual fears and collective ones . They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not_only on the external <head>world</head> , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group . Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized . Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act . To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .</context>
