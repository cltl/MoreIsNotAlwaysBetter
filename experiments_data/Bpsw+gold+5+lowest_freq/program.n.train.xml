      <context> During the next five years the leaders of the Fair_Deal reluctantly backed_down from the optimistic expectations of the New_Deal . During the next five years liberal leaders in the United_States sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment - and the bitterest irony - enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : the atom_bomb . In 1952 , it will be remembered , the G._O._P. without positive <head>program</head> campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly . All_of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you . But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common_man , to point_up what happened to him under Eisenhower 's leadership . A perceptive journalist , Sam_Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as The Revolt Of The Moderates .</context>

      <context> They , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower requested that the Commission be administered by the American_Assembly_of_Columbia_University , because it was non-partisan . The Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of_what I would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism . And here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above : `` The paramount goal of the United_States , set long_ago , was to guard the rights of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity '' . This group is secularist and their <head>program</head> tends to be technological . But it is the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as symptom of the common_man 's malaise . And let me add Murray 's new book as another symptom of_it , particularly so in_view_of the attention Time magazine gave it when it came_out recently . Father_Murray goes_back to the Declaration_of_Independence , too , though I may add , with considerably more historical perception .</context>

      <context> A third aspect , and probably the one open_to most controversy , is the results of the election . The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested parties , including the government itself , were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections . The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics . Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government <head>program</head> and official address since independence . They were stressed in the speeches of Si_Mubarak_Bekkai when the first Council_of_Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council . King_Muhammad /5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections on May_Day , 1957 . There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister_of_the_Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less_than enthusiastic .</context>
