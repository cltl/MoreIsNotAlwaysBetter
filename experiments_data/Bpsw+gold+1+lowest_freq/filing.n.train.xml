      <context> I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces . This means practically everybody in this room . Whether it will strike_home for you or not will be for you to determine . The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a colleague , a question from the Secretary or the President , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad , the <head>filing</head> of an item for the agenda of the United_Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies , a news_item read at the breakfast_table , a question to the President or the Secretary at a news_conference , a speech by a Senator or Congressman , an article in a periodical , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad , et_cetera , ad_infinitum . The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility . His first thought is about the question itself : Is there a question here for American foreign_policy , and , if so , what is it ?</context>

      <context> The words amended_return should be plainly written across the top of such return . April 15 is usually the final date for filing income_tax_returns for most people because they use the calendar_year ending on December 31 . If you use a fiscal_year , a year ending on the last day of any month other_than December , your return is_due on or before the 15_th day of the 4_th month after the close of your tax year . If the last day ( due_date ) for performing any act for tax purposes , such_as <head>filing</head> a return or making a tax payment , etc. , falls on Saturday , Sunday , or a legal_holiday , you may perform that act on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday , Sunday , or legal_holiday . Since April 15 , 1962 , is on Sunday your return for the calendar_year 1961 will be timely filed if it is filed on or before Monday , April 16 , 1962 . If you mail a return or tax payment , you must place it in the mails in ample time to reach the district director on or before the due_date . If you were required to file a declaration_of_estimated_tax for the calendar_year 1961 , it is not necessary to pay the fourth installment otherwise due on January 15 , 1962 , if you file your income_tax_return Form_1040 , and pay your tax in_full for the calendar_year 1961 by January 31 , 1962 .</context>
