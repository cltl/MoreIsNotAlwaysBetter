      <context> It is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at_least the practical consequences thereof , upon others . It is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched_fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others . Both Roman_Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past . Consider what happened during World_War_1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition <head>law</head> through Congress . Many_of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful . With over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . With the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens .</context>

      <context> It was Dickson who suggested to Lord_Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United_States . In September 1817 at Fort_Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of Sioux , he escorted to Prairie_du_Chien . During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United_States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red_River and that the United_States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England . Upon arriving_at Baltimore , Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John_Quincy_Adams , Secretary_of_State at Washington , inquiring about <head>laws</head> covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois_Territories '' . This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at_first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements '' . The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop_into a trade_route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected . In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the Forks '' ( Fort_Douglas ) and in December 1819 , twenty men left Fort_Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie_du_Chien .</context>

      <context> Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the <head>law</head> as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services . Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry_out the provisions of the Act . The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational_rehabilitation_program , providing_for a three part grant structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational_rehabilitation - and in_addition for short-term training and instruction .</context>

      <context> By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of <head>law</head> '' .

The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called_in and notices of further investigation appeared from_time_to_time . In January , 1958 , the Minister_of_the_Interior announced that an election <head>law</head> was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied . In late 1957 the M.P. ( Mouvement_Populaire ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council_of_Government under Balafrej was formed without support from progressive elements in the party . The parties were on_the_whole unprepared for elections , while the people were still experiencing post independence let-down and suffering the after_effects of poor harvests in 1957 .</context>

      <context> They were increasingly looked_upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new , constructive national effort . To minimize the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government was formed a titre personnel and a special office was created in the Ministry_of_the_Interior to plan and to conduct the elections . By this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete . There remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the <head>laws</head> through the labyrinth of Palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions . From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results . In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance . In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence , but in a system where there is as_yet no place for the less prominent .</context>

      <context> First , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity . National identification was not new , but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new unifications occurred . It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will '' put_forward by the Germans , especially by Hegel , although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of Hobbes . National identification was reflected jurisprudentially in <head>law</head> theories which incorporated this Hegelian abstraction and saw law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection . In the international community this reduced law to Jellinek 's auto_limitation . A state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of self-will , or consent . According_to the new theories , the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was `` sovereign '' in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessors .</context>

      <context> By this time large_numbers of the audience had left the hall . Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city . He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments . In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took_part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the <head>laws</head> have condemned '' . He recalled that in Rhode_Island a party opposed to the state 's condemnation of a man ( Thomas_W._Dorr ) proclaimed the state 's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty . At the close of Davis ' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously : Whereas , John_Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper :</context>

      <context> On Wednesday morning , November_2 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fairer trial . The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted . The readers of the Providence_Daily_Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old_Brown '' had a fair trial . Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her <head>laws</head> , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' . In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical . J._Wheaton_Smith , editor of the Warren_Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in_order_that all those misnamed philantropists [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' . The editor of the Newport_Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment .</context>
