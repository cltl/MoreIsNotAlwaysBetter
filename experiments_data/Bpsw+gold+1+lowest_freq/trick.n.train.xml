      <context> `` To get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments Dr._Schillinger of the Lincoln_Institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps . He must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish . He must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding '' ' . Too many husbands , Dr._Schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they 're doing '' , and fear that their success depends_on some <head>trick</head> or technique of sexual play .</context>

      <context> From above one could only occasionally catch_a_glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block . That was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch . Another had ended before it began . Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ; the <head>tricks</head> that time plays_with memory and memory with time are queerest of all . From maturity one looks_back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large . In a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a_lot of water ; the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it . Time in the sum is nothing .</context>

      <context> The Brannon outfit - known as the Slash-B because of its brand - reached Hondo_Creek before sundown . The herd was watered and_then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night 's bedground . Two of the new hands , a Mexican named Jose_Amado and a kid known only as Laredo , were picked for the first <head>trick</head> of riding night herd . The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda . They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie 's fire , rolled and lighted brown paper cigarettes , lounged_about . There was some idle_talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day 's drive .</context>
