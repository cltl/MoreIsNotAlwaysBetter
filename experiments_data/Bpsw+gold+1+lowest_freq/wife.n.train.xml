      <context> The wife 's attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job .

      <context> When did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? Some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub_gin . Virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs . Left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern <head>wife</head> assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male . Circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child rearing , money handling and home maintenance .

Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed . The <head>wife</head> is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart_as_a_whip - often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage . She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband . The husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job - often an organization man whose motto for getting_ahead is : `` Do n't rock_the_boat '' . Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage .</context>

This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil_geologist . The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window_sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting_out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass_through a whole house , visible all_the_way up through wire gratings on each floor . His files , desk , drafting_board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos .</context>
