      <context> If the Orioles are to break their losing_streak within the next two days , it will have to be at_the_expense_of the American_League champion New_York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night_game and a single test Sunday afternoon . The flavor of Baltimore 's Florida_Grapefruit_League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron_Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army 's military training_program and is ready for belated spring_training . Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove_in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average , completes the Birds ' spring squad at 49 players . The big , 22 - year old shortstop , the 1960 American_league `` rookie of the year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $ 15000 and was a spectator at tonight 's 5 - to 3 <head>loss</head> to Kansas_City - the winless Birds ' sixth setback in_a_row . The 6 - foot 3 inch Hansen checked_in close_to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting_weight last spring . He hopes to melt_off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks_camp three weeks hence . When he was inducted into the Army at Fort_Knox_, Ky. , Hansen 's weight had dropped to 180 - `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said .</context>

      <context> R._H._S._Crossman , M.P. , writing in The_Manchester_Guardian , states that departures from West_Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a week .

The weekly <head>loss</head> is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each_week from West_Germany , but the hard truth , says Crossman , is that `` The closing_off of East_Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East_German , as distinct from Russian , troops was a major Communist victory , which dealt West_Berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow . The gallant half city is dying on_its_feet '' . Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in the Observer ( London ) . Mark_Arnold-Foster writes : `` People are leaving [ West_Berlin ] because they think it is dying .</context>

      <context> If the student drops_out of high_school , the break with the school is even more complete . When there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement - or lack of arrangement - works_out quite well .

Statistically this has represented a <head>loss</head> to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one . I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high_school and was highly successful in the business which he entered .

      <context> If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about * * f km of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic_energy less than their potential_energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . De_Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more_and_more eccentric without changing the semi major_axis . This effect can give_rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth . Since there is a continual <head>loss</head> of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary_space . There are several possible sources . According_to Whipple ( 1955 ) , cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state . Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material .</context>

      <context> It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts ' Route_128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements , or from the exploitation of patents which grant at_least a partial monopoly .

But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago - a new bedroom_set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior - the family set_off for the downtown department_store , where the selection would be greatest .</context>
