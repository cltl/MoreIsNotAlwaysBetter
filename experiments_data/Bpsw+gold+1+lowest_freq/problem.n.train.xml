Simon on " learning by doing " in semantically rich domains ( e.g. Anzai &amp; Simon , 1979 ; Bhaskar &amp; Simon , 1977 ) , researchers began to investigate problem solving separately in different natural knowledge domains – such as physics , writing , or chess playing – thus relinquishing their attempts to extract a global theory of problem solving ( e.g. Sternberg &amp; Frensch , 1991 ) .

After_all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates .

An excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high_school is the Dunbar_Vocational_High_School in Chicago .

Hardly_a window has been broken since Dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major <head>problem</head> in many slum_areas ) . I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes .

      <context> By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ; he collapses , and dies . In the work of every artist , I suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about ; not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image , a single moment . So here . The horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone_wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed_up as a whore dressing_up as a baby ; the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; the bringing_together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the <head>problem</head> of suffering '' ) ; the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant - all this seems a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ; beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann 's work . When I try to work_out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , I come_up with the following ideas , which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay .

      <context> The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns_on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love . The release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or_else absolutely impossible ; and the motion toward it brings disaster . This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ; it is particularly the artist ( Tonio_Kro^ger , Aschenbach , Leverku^hn ) who suffers from it . The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the <head>problem</head> of the `` breakthrough '' in the realm of art . Again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child . Finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing_up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with Cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann 's stories . We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates .</context>

According_to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit . The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the <head>problem</head> . Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced .

If , as I suspect , the <head>problem</head> is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems .

      <context> A good many beef hungry settlers were accepting the death of William_Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats .

Even in the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still disappearing . For less_than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on - a blatant and defiant rustler named Fred_Powell . `` Fred was mighty crude about the way he took_in cattle '' his own hired_man , Andy_Ross , mentioned later .</context>

      <context> Not_only was Haumd 's intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in_stride . For_example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest F major register up_to a barely audible N minor in four seconds , not skipping , at_the_same_time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist 's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage . We would have preferred , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain_from laughing at this and other spots on the recording , since it mars an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance . As Broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted_down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musicals and inspirational <head>problem</head> dramas , the American theatre is going_through an inexorable renaissance in_that nebulous area known_as `` off-Broadway '' . For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention .</context>

      <context> Done in the modern style of a `` confession '' , Fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother 's pet salamander , Alicia .

Max , in a fit of despair , takes Alicia and runs_off for two marvelous weeks in Burbank ( Fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which Alicia tragically contracts Parkinson's_disease and dies .
