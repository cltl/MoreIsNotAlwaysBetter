      <context> She liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up . `` Very few wives '' , says Dr._Calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going_to become submissive where sex is concerned . A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual_relationship as_well '' . And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive - the comparatively recent <head>discovery</head> of the true depths of female desire and response . Marriage manuals and women 's magazine_articles began to stress the importance of the female climax . They began to describe in_detail the woman 's capacity for response . In_fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , Dr._Albert_Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men .</context>

      <context> After three weeks ' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas . The ship halted . The great `` sea to the westwards '' was a dead_end . This must have been Hudson 's blackest <head>discovery</head> . For he seemed to sense at_once that before him was no South_Sea , but the solid bulk of the North_American continent . This was the bitter_end , and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure . Feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition .</context>

      <context> Twice he had failed , and the Muscovy_Company indicated it would not back him again . In 1609 , the Dutch_East_India_Company hired Hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the Half_Moon , and supplied him with Dutch sailors . This time he turned westward , to the middle_Atlantic coast of North_America . His chief <head>discovery</head> was important - the Great_North ( later , the Hudson ) River - but it produced no northwest passage . When the Half_Moon put in at Dartmouth , England , in the fall of 1609 , word of Hudson 's findings leaked_out , and English interest in him revived . The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship . He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth .</context>

      <context> Among the recipients of the Nobel_Prize for Literature more_than half are practically unknown to readers of English . Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding <head>discoveries</head> than Verner_von_Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago . Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present . In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as_much_as_possible speak_for himself . Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family .</context>

      <context> We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted . It may have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it did n't prevent the paintings from being exciting . He also had , at_times , an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker ; he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For_Christ's_sake , Donald , you 've got Prussian_blue all_over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all_over his pants as_well . Mrs._Monmouth thought_of him as her <head>discovery</head> , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting . It was all gravy , and Donald did n't need much to live_on ; none of us did . We shared the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap lodgings of one kind or another . Attending the life_class was my idea - or rather , Askington 's idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two would n't have gone if I had n't talked them into it .</context>
