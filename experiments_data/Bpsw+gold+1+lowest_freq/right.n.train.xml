      <context> From the 1830s to the 1880s , <head>there</head> was a shift in the Western world of social class structure and the economy , moving away from nobility and aristocracy towards capitalism . This general economic shift toward capitalism affected centre right movements such as the British Conservative Party , which responded by becoming supportive of capitalism . In British politics , the terms ' right ' and ' left ' came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the Spanish Civil War .</context>

      <context> Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee_Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning appearance , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . Whitey_Herzog , performing in <head>right</head> as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base_on_balls . Then three consecutive pinch_hitters failed to produce . Pete_Ward was sent in_for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short . John_Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2 - and 2 pitches , and Buddy_Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced_out sharply to Jerry_Lumpe at second to end the 2 - hour and - 27 - minute contest .</context>

      <context> Mr._Khrushchev 's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ; the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U_Thant represents . In_a_sense , the showdown promised by Mr._Hammarskjold 's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; no precedents have been set as_yet ; structurally , the U.N. is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing_to_bear upon it . But at_least the pessimists who believed that the world_organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong . No one who has studied the radical <head>Right</head> can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade . These are mentalities which crave action - and they are beginning to get_it , as Messrs._Salsich and Engh report on page 372 . Even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately ? ) left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading .</context>

      <context> However much we may have to criticize liberal theology 's constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it . In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann 's attempt to formulate such a theology has led . For we have said , in_effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative . If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` <head>right</head> '' is clearly untenable . Whereas Bultmann 's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl_Barth , involves the rejection or at_least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered . It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length .</context>

We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri .</context>

      <context> Hence , if what is in_question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a_little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded . Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on_the_one_hand , by the two at_least apparently self-consistent but mutually_exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on_the_other_hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann . A second point requires more extended comment . It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` <head>right</head> '' , as represented by Barth , rests_on the following thesis : The only tenable alternative to Bultmann 's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at_least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus_Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann 's point_of_view , are mythological .</context>
