      <context> I am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal 's attitude toward the South . It appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends . His assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at_least partly in_sympathy_with his views . Time 's <head>editor</head> , Thomas_Griffith , in his book , The Waist High Culture , wrote : `` most of what was different about it ( the Deep_South ) I found myself unsympathetic to '' . This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement . Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism . I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North .</context>

      <context> On Wednesday evening , November 23 , 1859 , in Warren , Rev._Mark_Trafton of New_Bedford , gave a `` Mission_of_Sympathy '' lecture in which he favorably viewed the Harper_'s_Ferry insurrection . The Warren_Telegraph stated that many of Rev._Trafton 's remarks were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism . In its account of the Trafton lecture , the Providence_Daily_Post said that the remarks of Rev._Trafton made the people indignant . No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence_Daily_Post , for the <head>editor</head> claimed that there were a score of men in the state_prison who were a_thousand times more deserving of sympathy . The Providence_Daily_Journal , however , stated that Brown 's courage , bravery , and heroism `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; it gives something of dignity even to a bad one '' . The Woonsocket_Patriot admitted that John_Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no_more be hung than Henry_A._Wise or James_Buchanan '' . The Newport_Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him .</context>

      <context> During the latter days of November to the day of Brown 's execution , it seems that most Rhode_Islanders did not concur in `` E._B. 's '' suggestion . On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown 's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions . A week later the Daily_Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John_Brown on the day of his execution . The <head>editor</head> of the Daily_Journal warned , `` that if such a demonstration be made , it will not find support or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak_for Providence '' . The Providence_Daily_Post 's editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be held in Providence . He further called_upon the people of Providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace . On December 2 , 1859 , John_Brown was hanged at Charles_Town , Virginia .</context>

      <context> The Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace . On October 31 , 1859 , John_Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder . For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in_public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 . Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , <head>editors</head> , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia . Although Rhode_Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John_Brown 's trial with extreme interest . On Wednesday morning , November_2 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fairer trial . The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted .</context>
