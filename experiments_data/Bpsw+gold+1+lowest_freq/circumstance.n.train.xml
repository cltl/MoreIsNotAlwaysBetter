      <context> Denouncing the view that the sexual_union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded_as the governing considerations of Christian marriage . One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . The Conference called_for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives . In 1930 , the Lambeth_Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited <head>circumstances</head> , contraception might be morally legitimate . In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth_control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere . Many other Protestant_denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action . In March , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the Federal_Council_of_Churches ratified artificial methods of birth_control .</context>

      <context> There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it . I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful_thinking : do n't talk_about the final stages of Reconstruction and they will take_care of themselves . Or_else the North really believes that all Southerners except a_few quaint old characters have come_around to realizing the errors of their past , and are now at_heart sharers of the American_Dream , like everybody else . If the <head>circumstances</head> are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true . The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western world . Regardless_of rights and wrongs , a population and an area appropriate to a pre World_War_I , great_power have been , following conquest , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike . And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent .</context>

      <context> But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy , well established precedents , the commitments of the United_States under international charters and treaties , basic statutes , and well understood notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such_as country papers and National_Security_Council papers accumulated in the Department . He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted . He must think_about which of these principles must take precedence . He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in <head>circumstance</head> . He is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem . He must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation_to the whole - when the whole is too_large to grasp . He must think_of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer .</context>

      <context> But the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for_example , can undermine distinctions such_as these . And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by_any_means . In the Steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them , and in I looked_up the number and I looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second . - Syllables are linguistic_units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but , as has been noted , are consonantal under certain <head>circumstances</head> , and which may or may not be combined with preceding and / or following consonants or combinations of consonants . Syllables are genuine units , but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties . Sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear . Doubt on this point is strongest before / l / and / / or / r / .</context>

      <context> `` I do n't mind at_all '' , he said , delighted with her attention .

She no_longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the <head>circumstances</head> of their meeting that first night in Parioli . That day they loafed around , just getting the feel of the city . They looked at the ruins of the old Roman wall on the lower Via_Veneto , then they went_to the Farnese_Gardens .
