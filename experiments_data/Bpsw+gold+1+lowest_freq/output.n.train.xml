      <context> The logic behind using the expenditure method is that <head>if</head> all the expenditures on final goods are added up , the sum should total the total production because the every produced good is eventually produced in some form or the other . In both these methods , one has to be wary of the fact that consumption includes all spending by households , but business investment does not include all spending by firms , because if it did this would result in massive double counting because many of the things firms buy are processed and resold to consumers . As a result , investment only includes expenditures on output that is not expected to be used up in the short run .</context>

The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great_Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War_of_1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go_to Red_River where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest_Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire . The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the <head>output</head> of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward . When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river . Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort_Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland .</context>
