      <context> In regard_to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of_this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light_mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's <head>testimony</head> was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on_trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as_well_as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? The infamous Wansee_Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put_to_death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich_Minister_of_the_Interior , the State_Secretary in_charge of the Four_Year_Plan , the Reich_Minister_of_Justice , the Under_Secretary_of_Foreign_Affairs .</context>

      <context> The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten - the gas_chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star_of_David - nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . Public_relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried_out : Too_much , too_much - the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had_to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most_of this <head>testimony</head> may have been legally admissible as bearing_on the corpus_delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject_to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs . Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection . Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought_on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr._Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies .</context>

      <context> It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing_officer 's report and notes at the trial . In_addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes . While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process . Moreover , his <head>testimony</head> at trial never developed any such facts . In the light of these circumstances , as_well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department 's recommendation , which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no relevancy in the hearing_officer 's report and notes . Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing_officer as_well as at the trial . He did receive a resume of it - the same that was furnished the appeal board - and he made no claim of its inaccuracy .</context>
