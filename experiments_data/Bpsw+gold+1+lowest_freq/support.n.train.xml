      <context> There was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white_heat . Not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent . Those would be reserved for the orchestra 's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself . This time the orchestra gave him some superb <head>support</head> fired by response to his own high mood . But he had in Walter_Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point . That_is , when Mr._Milstein thrust straight to the core of the music , sparks flying , bow shredding , violin singing , glittering and sometimes spitting , Mr._Hendl could go_along . But Mr._Hendl does not go straight to any point .</context>

      <context> ( Several times recently I have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in_front_of their eyes . I'm glad to say there 's none of that distraction in this `` Fiorello ! '' ) It has all been done in superb style , and the result is a show which deserves the <head>support</head> of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical_theater . Loew_'s_Theater presents `` Where_the_Boys_are '' , an MGM picture produced by Joe_Pasternak and directed by Henry_Levin from a screenplay by George_Wells . The cast : Since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , is a rich Brown senior , while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists , I suppose I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on `` Where_the_Boys_are '' , but I shall do nothing of the sort .</context>

The coalition was to prove inadvisable . O_'_Banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright_blue eyes stared with a kind_of frozen candour into others ' . He had a round , frank Irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in_place even when he was pumping bullets into someone 's body .</context>

      <context> For years the United_States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro 's representative from secret military talks . But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job . There is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week . You can see it , for_example , in the extensive efforts President_Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan <head>support</head> for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by_the_way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past . What the next move will be only time , of_course , will tell . Personally , I think we ought to set_up an immediate naval_blockade of Cuba . We simply can n't tolerate further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba .</context>

      <context> To round_out the blockading force , submarines would be needed - to locate , identify and track approaching vessels . Land based radar would help with this task . So would radar picket_ships . A squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add <head>support</head> to the carrier task_forces . Three requirements go_with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; and it must be enforced without discrimination . Once these conditions of international_law are met , countries that try to run to blockade do so at their own risk . Blockade runners can be stopped - by gunfire , if necessary - searched and held , at_least temporarily .</context>

      <context> For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in_general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it . He is interested in public opinion for two reasons : first , because it is important in itself , and , second , because he knows that the American public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind . And , given probable public attitudes - about which reasonably good estimates can be made - what action is called_for to insure necessary <head>support</head> ? May I add a caution on this particular point ? We do not want policy officers below the level of Presidential appointees to concern themselves too_much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign_policy action . In_the_first_place our business is foreign_policy , and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem .</context>

      <context> Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National_Guard contained in the 1960 Department_of_Defense Appropriation_Act should likewise be dropped . I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . I again proposed a reduction in the Army National_Guard and Army_Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal_year 1961 . These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in <head>support</head> of our national security objectives . - About 30 % of the expenditures for the Department_of_Defense in 1961 are for military_personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel . These expenditures are estimated to be $ 12.1 billion , an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social_security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) . Retired pay costs are increased by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel .</context>

      <context> Strategy and tactics of the U._S. military_forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history . The change of emphasis from conventional type to missile type warfare must be made with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other . Our military_forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us , from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war . - This budget will provide in the fiscal_year 1961 for the continued <head>support</head> of our forces at approximately the present level - a year-end strength of 2489000 men and women in the active forces . The forces to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870000 men ; a Navy of 817 active ships and 619000 men ; a Marine_Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175000 men ; and an Air_Force of 91 combat wings and 825000 men . If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must conform_to the changing character and missions of the active forces . Quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers .</context>

      <context> For the old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead , and the city mourned him . He was a loud-voiced man , once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability . He was stern and overbearing with his flock , but obsequious and conciliatory with the whites , especially the rich who partly supported the church . The Deacon_Board , headed by a black_man named Carlson , had practically taken_over as the pastor grew old , and had_its_way with the <head>support</head> of the Amen_corner . The characteristic thing about this church was its Amen_corner and the weekly religious orgy . A knot of old worshippers , chiefly women , listened weekly to a sermon . It began invariably in low tones , almost conversational , and then gradually worked_up to high , shrill appeals to God and man .</context>
