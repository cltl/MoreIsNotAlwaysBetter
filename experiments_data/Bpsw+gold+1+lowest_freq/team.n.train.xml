This dissatisfaction led to Howsam 's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game . The powerful New_York Yankees won their 19th world_series in a 5 - game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13 - 5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale . With Mickey_Mantle and Yogi_Berra both out_of_action due_to injuries , the American_League champs still mounted a 15 - hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one <head>team</head> in a series game . Johnny_Blanchard , Mantle 's replacement , slammed a 2 - run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey_Jay in a 5 - run first inning . Hector_Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3 - run homer off Bill_Henry during another 5 - run explosion in the fourth . The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors .</context>

Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball_game , trailing only 6 - 3 , but the drive fizzled when John_Edwards fouled_out with men on second and third and two out .
