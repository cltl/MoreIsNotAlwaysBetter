      <context> To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; the granular texture thus created likewise called_attention_to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . These areas by_virtue_of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued - and set to shuttling again - only by conventional perspective ; that_is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . The <head>accumulation</head> of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in_order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas .</context>
