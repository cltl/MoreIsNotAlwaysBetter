      <context> The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' .

The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary 's court which has been under_fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and <head>compensation</head> . The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating_procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand_juries , the Atlanta_Bar_Association and an interim citizens_committee . `` These actions should serve to protect in_fact and in_effect the court 's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . Regarding Atlanta 's new million dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes_charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' .</context>

      <context> Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due_to the demanding combination of qualifications called_for by this type of management work . The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties .

      <context> It is they who read - and make - Jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them . In upper teen Jewish life , the non college group tends to have a sense of marginality . `` People automatically assume that I 'm in college '' , a nineteen year old machinist observed irritably . However , among the girls , there are some morale enhancing <head>compensations</head> for not going_to college . The Jewish working_girl almost invariably works in an office - in contradistinction to gentile factory_workers - and , buttressed by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college_student . She is even prone to regard the college_girl as immature . One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost .</context>

      <context> He is confronted with the recurrent crises , such_as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life - marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old_age , the certainty of death . He has_to cope_with frustration and other emotional_disturbance and anomie . His religious_beliefs provide him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern , and his religious faith makes possible fortitude , equanimity , and consolation , enabling him to endure colossal misfortune , fear , frustration , uncertainty , suffering , evil , and danger . Religion usually also includes a principle of <head>compensation</head> , mainly in a promised perfect future state . The belief in immortality , where held , functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here_and_now . The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance . The feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as_well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving_vent to emotions and energies .</context>
