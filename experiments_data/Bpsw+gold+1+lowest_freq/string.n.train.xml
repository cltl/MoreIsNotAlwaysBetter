      <context> Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick - several every Saturday , in_fact - out of football . Moritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip_pads but he 's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the cotton_bowl . That 's because he already has kicked 14 extra_points in 15 tries . He ran his <head>string</head> of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41 - 8 slaughter of Washington_State . Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . But ask coach Darrell_Royal what position he plays and you 'll get the quick response , `` place_kicker '' . A 208 - pound , 6 - foot 1 - inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking .</context>

He had forgotten that she was so pretty . But her prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : cruelty , meanness , self-will .</context>
