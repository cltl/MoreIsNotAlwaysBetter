      <context> The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics . But why gymnastics at_all ? And is the sport really important ? After_all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics <head>competition</head> . But if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics . Taking first things first , let 's understand the sport called gymnastics .</context>

      <context> Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum . It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise . The old established independent art_schools try their best to fulfill their obligations . Yet even here many_a problem is presented ; as in a recent design <head>competition</head> with a floor_plan and the simple command - `` design a luxury apartment '' ; no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical_area or local social necessities - simply `` a luxury apartment '' . Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show_pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public_relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior_design . It is possible , of_course , to work_on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so_that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior_design demands . Unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule .</context>

      <context> But Mercer 's explanation was simple : `` I made_out the check and carried it around a_few days unsigned - in_case I lost it '' . When he remembered that he might have not signed the check , Mercer made_out another for the same amount , instructing the bank to destroy the other - especially if he had happened_to have absent-mindedly signed both of them . When the family business failed , Mercer left school and on his mother 's urging - for she hoped that he would become an actor - he joined a local little theater group . When the troupe traveled_to New_York to participate in a one act play <head>competition</head> - and won - Mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in New_York . He had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah . But Mercer hung_on , living , after_a_fashion , in a Greenwich_Village fourth flight walk-up . `` The place had no sink or washbasin , only a bathtub '' , his mother discovered when she visited him .</context>

      <context> There were three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of voters and the registration of candidates . Voter registration began in late November 1959 and continued until early January , 1960 . The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response . Periodic bulletins of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of <head>competition</head> among provincial officials . A goal was fixed , as given in Table 2 , and attention focused_on its fulfillment . The qualifications to vote were kept very simple . Both men and women of twenty-one years of_age could register and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification .</context>
