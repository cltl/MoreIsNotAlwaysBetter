      <context> Pelham pointed_out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . A veteran Jackson_County legislator will ask the Georgia_House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . Rep._Mac_Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided_that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in <head>Washington</head> who would_like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday . It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the State_Board_of_Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises .</context>

      <context> Dozens of seemingly small matters go_wrong all_over the world . Sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them . I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come_across little things going_wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them . If the Department_of_State is to take primary responsibility for foreign_policy in <head>Washington</head> , it follows that the ambassador is expected to take_charge overseas . This does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion . He is expected to know about what is going_on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed in his country . He is expected to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can .</context>
