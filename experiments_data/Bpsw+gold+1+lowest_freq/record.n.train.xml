      <context> Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James_P._Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . Garden_Fresh , the result of a mating of Better_Self and Rosy_Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St._Patrick's_Day_Purse with some speed in reserve . She was moving_up to the allowance department after winning a $ 10000 claiming event . George_Kerr , the swift striding Jamaican , set a meet <head>record</head> in the 600 - yard run in the Knights_of_Columbus track_meet tonight , beating Purdue 's Dave_Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . Kerr , who set the world_record earlier this month in New_York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped_out Mills 's early pace and beat the young Big_10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal_Whitfield . Mills shot out in_front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race .</context>

      <context> I can't throw . Suddenly my reflexes are gone . Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . And so it was over the weekend what with 40 - year old Warren_Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants ' Willie_Mays retaliating with a <head>record</head> tying 4 - homer spree Sunday . Both , of_course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . It was a real stimulant to a_lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2 - score year milestone .</context>

      <context> Inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph_Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey . The Major decided that , rather_than be led , the slugger could lead . And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so_far . The opinion continues here that with a 162 - game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10 - team league and a most inviting target in Los_Angeles ' Wrigley_Field_Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous <head>record</head> on the books , Babe_Ruth 's 60 homers of 1927 . Mays ' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year . Willie 's wonderful walloping Sunday - four home_runs - served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin_Dark . Next to Leo_Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass green rookie rushed up_to the Polo_Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant .</context>

      <context> He was a member of The Fighting_Seventh . Although it was at the Battle_of_The_Little_Horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history , that the 7_th_Cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then . Brevet_Major_General_George_Armstrong_Custer was the regiment 's first permanent commander and , like such generals as George_S._Patton and Terry_de_la_Mesa_Allen in their rise to military prominence , Custer was a believer in blood_and_guts warfare . During the Civil_War , Custer , who achieved a brilliant <head>record</head> , was made brigadier_general at the age of 23 . He finished the war as a major_general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major_general in the history of the U._S. Army .</context>

      <context> In_addition , the SBA uses such criteria as number of employees and dollar_volume of the business . The credit requirements stipulate that the applicant must have the ability to operate the business successfully and have enough capital in the business so that , with loan assistance from the SBA , it will be able to operate on a sound financial basis . A proposed loan must be for sound purposes or sufficiently secured so_as to assure a reasonable chance of repayment . The <head>record</head> of past earnings and prospects for the future must indicate it has the ability to repay the loan out of current and anticipated income . The amount which may be borrowed from the SBA depends_on how much is required to carry_out the intended purpose of the loan . The maximum loan which SBA may make to any one borrower is $ 350000 . Business loans generally are repayable in regular installments - usually monthly , including interest at the rate of 5 - 1/2 percent per_annum on the unpaid balance - and have a maximum maturity of 10 years ; the term of loans for working_capital is 6 years .</context>

      <context> It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of New_York . They were n't as well paid as they should have been . One reason the portwatchers let Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen . Sposato needed a front , some labor stiff with a clean <head>record</head> to act_as business_agent of the Redhook local . There I was a retired wobbly and structural iron_worker who 'd never gouged a cent off a fellow_worker in my thirty years in the movement . For once radicalism was a recommendation .
