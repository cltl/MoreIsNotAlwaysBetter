      <context> <head>Particularly</head> in the 19th century , economic expansion of the US increased immigrant flow , and nearly 15 % of the population was foreign born , thus making up a significant amount of the labor force . Barriers to immigration come not only in legal form or political form ; natural and social barriers to immigration can also be very powerful . Immigrants when leaving their country also leave everything familiar : their family , friends , support network , and culture .</context>

      <context> Much of the empirical research on the causal relationship between immigration <head>and</head> crime has been limited due to weak instruments for determining causality . According to one economist writing in 2014 , " while there have been many papers that document various correlations between immigrants and crime for a range of countries and time periods , most do not seriously address the issue of causality . " The problem with causality primarily revolves around the location of immigrants being endogenous , which means that immigrants tend to disproportionally locate in deprived areas where crime is higher ( because they can not afford to stay in more expensive areas ) or because they tend to locate in areas where there is a large population of residents of the same ethnic background .</context>

      <context> Of_course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr._Fisher , then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury , to the Vatican last December . It was the first time an English Primate has done this since the 14th century . English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope . Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic <head>immigrants</head> ; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary_school during the sickness of one of its masters ; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` Catholics , if the present system is still in_operation , will constitute almost one-third of the House_of_Lords in the next generation '' ; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic_church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave .</context>

      <context> But I think that something more than this is involved . How did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New_England as it did in other parts of the country ? Is n't it a_bit odd that the three states of Southern New_England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode_Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A_+_M_colleges ? Was it supposed , perchance , that A_+_M ( vocational_training , that_is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant_class which flooded that part of the New_England world in the post Civil_War period , the <head>immigrants</head> having been brought_in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make_up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ? Is it not ironical that Roger_Williams 's state , Rhode_Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? The state universities of Maine , New_Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; they had less immigration to contend with .
