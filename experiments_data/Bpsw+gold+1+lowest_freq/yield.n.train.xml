      <context> <head>In</head> finance , the term yield describes the amount in cash ( in percentage terms ) that returns to the owners of a security , in the form of interest or dividends received from the security .

Yield applies to various stated rates of return on stocks ( common and preferred , and convertible ) , fixed income instruments ( bonds , notes , bills , strips , zero coupon ) , and some other investment type insurance products ( e.g. annuities ) .</context>
