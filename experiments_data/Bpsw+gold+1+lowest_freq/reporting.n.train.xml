      <context> Reporting and editing <head>do</head> not occur in a vacuum but always reflect the political context in which journalists , no less than other citizens , operate . Journalists who believe they are being fair or objective may give biased accountsâ€”by reporting selectively , trusting too much to anecdote , or giving a partial explanation of actions . Even in routine reporting , bias can creep into a story through a reporter 's choice of facts to summarize , or through failure to check enough sources , hear and report dissenting voices , or seek fresh perspectives .</context>

All_too often our language is unduly harsh . The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper <head>reporting</head> - already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family_planning . Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed . Family_planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring . Pope_Pius_12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long_time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such_as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications '' .</context>
