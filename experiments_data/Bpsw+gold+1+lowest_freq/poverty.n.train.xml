      <context> He thought how this dainty , fragile older woman threading her way through the streets of Westminster on a day in June , enjoying the flowers in the shops , the greetings from old friends , but never really drawing a deep , passionate breath , was so like himself . He , and Mrs._Dalloway , too , had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug_into the bone_marrow of the spirit . He had not because he was both poor and ambitious . <head>Poverty</head> imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious . They cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars along a dark country lane . No , they must look_the_other_way and climb one more painful step up the ladder . He made the decision with his eyes open , or so he thought .</context>

Annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham , near the Georgia border and on the Tallahoosa_River , a small and dirty stream . The city was a center of manufacture , especially in textiles , and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings , a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama . But it had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black_Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived - servants and laborers huddled_together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much <head>poverty</head> and crime . Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city over ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were . Beyond were industries and factories . Then they went_down to Black_Bottom .</context>
