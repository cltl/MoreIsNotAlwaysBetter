      <context> The earliest modern circuses were performed in open air structures with limited <head>covered</head> seating . From the late 18th to late 19th century bespoke circus buildings ( often wooden ) were built with various types of seating , a centre ring and sometimes a stage . The ' traditional ' large tents , commonly known as ' Big Tops ' were introduced in the mid 19th century as touring circuses superseded static venues .</context>

      <context> The main purpose of the top is to anchor the shrouds of the <head>topmast</head> that extends above it . Shrouds down to the side of the hull would be at too acute an angle from the mast , so struts running out from the mast are added to take the place of the hull for a smaller copy ( the topmast ) of the lower mast and its rigging . Placing a few timbers between these struts produces a useful platform , the top .</context>

      <context> Rookie Ron_Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made_it two straight over Indianapolis , 5 - 3 . The husky 6 - 3 , 205 - pound lefthander , was in command all_the_way before an on_the_scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . It was Nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight . They now lead Louisville by a full game on <head>top</head> of the American_Association pack . Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley_Hinton in the third inning . He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday 's opener , and never lagged .</context>

      <context> A year later they were 4 - 13 . Since 1949 , the St._Louis club has been below .500 on May 1 just four times . The '49 team was off to a so-so 5 - 5 beginning , then fell as low as 12 - 17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories . The '52 Cards were 6 - 7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club 's <head>top</head> since 1949 . Then last season the_Birds tumbled as low as 11 - 18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . Since 1949 , the only National_League club that got_off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team . Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 .</context>

      <context> The air took_on a special strength now that they 'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind . There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt_water , clams , seaweed and northern air . He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin wife as the last century ended . Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on <head>top</head> of the headland and coming_upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant . `` Remember the Starbird ? '' Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came_down . `` The_Starbird , '' Abel said .</context>

      <context> The grocery the youth worked for soon tired_of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go . The beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off . Reduced to beggary , he at_last got a job as office_boy to a television producer . His hubris , deficiency of taste , and sadism carried him straightaway to the <head>top</head> . He evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks , and quickly superseded his boss . Not long_ago , I rode down with him in an elevator in Radio_City ; he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at_once , clearly a man in_extremis . `` See that guy '' ? the operator asked pityingly .</context>
