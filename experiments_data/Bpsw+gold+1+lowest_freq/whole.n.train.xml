      <context> Is your R_+_D or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ? Are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R_+_D people ? Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it 's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash_register . Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution_costs ; and translate the <head>whole</head> into profit_and_loss and balance_sheet figures which management can act_on with some assurance ? We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans - and management could n't make_up_its_mind . There is a shortage of salesmen today . In the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still .</context>

      <context> For its part the Hudson's_Bay_Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement . As the time drew_near for the drawing of the British American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the Pembina_colony - its own post and Fort_Daer - was on American territory . Accordingly Selkirk 's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by October , John_Halkett had torn_down both posts , floating the timber to `` the Forks '' in rafts . `` I have done everything '' , he wrote , `` to break_up the <head>whole</head> of that unfortunate establishment '' . Despite Company threats , duly carried_through , to cut_off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing_nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village . They would attempt to bring supplies from St._Louis or Prairie_du_Chien at `` great expense as well as danger '' . At Fort_Garry some of the_Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United_States , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort_Snelling .</context>

      <context> In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon_Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human_beings and events . But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap . I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth . I use this term to mean three things : a search for the human significance of an event or state_of_affairs , a tendency to look_at <head>wholes</head> rather_than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling . It is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia . I think these attributes cluster , but I have no evidence . In_fact , I can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art .</context>

      <context> This claim , as submitted to the District_Court and dismissed by it , 126_F._Supp .235 , alleged violation not_only of 7 of the Clayton_Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman_Act . The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the <head>whole</head> or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' .</context>

      <context> In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role . Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced . We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk_lore of the Greeks . In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral <head>whole</head> , original - a new thing . It is not merely a new thing ; it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; most_of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism . But to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin_Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine 's encounter with man . New , indeed , is Luther 's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at .</context>
