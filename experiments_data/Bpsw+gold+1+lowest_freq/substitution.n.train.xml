      <context> Dr._Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream . He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite , and imagined it must have been German or English . We may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr._Hilprecht 's subconscious reasoning . But , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden <head>substitution</head> ? Which theory is more fantastic : 1 . that the perfect continuity was composed from the job_lot of memory impressions in the professor 's brain , or 2 . that the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met ?</context>
