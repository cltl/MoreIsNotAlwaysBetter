      <context> There is no_more `` plot '' than that ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give . The artistic interest , then , lies_in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness . The first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent : `` The way to the churchyard ran_along beside the highroad , ran beside it all_the_way to the end ; that_is_to_say , to the churchyard '' . And the action is consistently presented with <head>regard</head> for this distinction . The highroad , one might say at_first , belongs_to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs_to death . But that is too simple , and won't hold_up . As the first sentence suggests , both roads belong_to death in_the_end .</context>

It was Giselle , the fille_de_chambre , come to clean the room , and while she stood before him with ears pricked_up and <head>regard</head> all curiosity , explaining her errand , Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird . Giselle was reluctant but Alex succeeded in persuading her to come_back in five minutes and the door was shut again . `` Who was that , young feller '' ? the doctor instantly asked . `` That was the fille_de_chambre , the one you thought could n't get the eggs out .</context>
