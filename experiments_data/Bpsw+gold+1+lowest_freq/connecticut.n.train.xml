      <context> The Connecticut River is the longest river in the New England region of the United States <head>.</head> Flowing roughly southward for 406.12 miles ( 653.59 km ) through four U.S. states , the Connecticut rises at the U.S. border with Quebec , Canada , and discharges at Long Island Sound .</context>

      <context> The race_problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive . It is these other differences between North and South - other , that_is , than those which concern discrimination or social_welfare - which I chiefly discuss herein . I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience . A Southerner married to a New_Englander , I have lived for many years in a <head>Connecticut</head> commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity_men , and business_executives of egghead tastes . Most_of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed_as , liberals . This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government . Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron_saints .</context>

      <context> It is true that New_England , more_than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start . But I think that something more than this is involved . How did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New_England as it did in other parts of the country ? Is n't it a_bit odd that the three states of Southern New_England ( Massachusetts , <head>Connecticut</head> , and Rhode_Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A_+_M_colleges ? Was it supposed , perchance , that A_+_M ( vocational_training , that_is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant_class which flooded that part of the New_England world in the post Civil_War period , the immigrants having been brought_in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make_up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ? Is it not ironical that Roger_Williams 's state , Rhode_Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? The state universities of Maine , New_Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; they had less immigration to contend with .</context>

      <context> There had also been a man who must have had St._Vitus or something , because he kept jerking his head . As reports dribbled in , William_Weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head . Mullins came_in . There was no sign of Mrs._Lauren_Payne at her house on Nod_Road , Ridgefield , <head>Connecticut</head> . The house was modern , large , on five acres . Must have cost plenty .
