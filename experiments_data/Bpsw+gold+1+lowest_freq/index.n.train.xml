      <context> Nicolas Chuquet used a form <head>of</head> exponential notation in the 15th century , which was later used by Henricus Grammateus and Michael Stifel in the 16th century . The word " exponent " was coined in 1544 by Michael Stifel . Samuel Jeake introduced the term indices in 1696 .</context>

      <context> The battery median grade equivalent was used in data analysis in this study . The Wechsler_Intelligence_Scale_for_Children was administered to each sample third grade child by a clinical worker . The relationship of intelligence_test scores to school achievement is a well established fact ( in this case , * * f ) ; therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor . The criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an <head>index</head> of over - or under-achievement . It is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the I._Q. . For_example , on the basis of the regression_equation , a child with an I._Q. of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 4.8 ( grade equivalent ) . If a child with an I._Q. of 120 scored 5.5 in achievement , his discrepancy score would be + .7 , representing .7 of one year of over-achievement .</context>

      <context> His first conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on Ath. and Yok . ) was partially positive . His second conclusion , on semantic word_classes , agrees with mine . This second conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored . Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an <head>index</head> of persistence , which weights not_only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative_frequency . Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is : stem identical in 8 languages , 100 % ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86 % ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , 64 % ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57 % . His formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material . But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; and Gleason presumably is on_the_way with a further contribution in this area .</context>
