There is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time . In B._M._Spinley 's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience .</context>

      <context> Perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation . Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean . It is at_least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as_well_as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature . In any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the <head>emotions</head> , particularly with_respect_to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature '' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required . In the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for_example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiments or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy_life regarded_as forbidden , or by half conscious ideas about the magical_power of words ? These are , if the research is done with subtlety and skill , researchable topics , but the research is missing . One of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide .</context>

      <context> Two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time . One , a reservation on the point I have just made , is the phenomenon of pseudo thinking , pseudo feeling , and pseudo willing , which Fromm discussed in The_Escape_from_Freedom . In_essence this involves grounding one 's thought and <head>emotion</head> in the values and experience of others , rather_than in one 's own values and experience . There is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else . Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important . Moreover , if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo thinking ; if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity .</context>

      <context> The terms `` renewal '' and `` refreshed '' , which often come_up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal '' of purpose and a `` refreshed '' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction . The notion of `` inspiration '' is somehow cognate to this feeling . How literature does this , or for whom , is certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the `` message '' , as_well_as the source , would all play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense_of_purpose . One of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of <head>emotion</head> . Let us differentiate a_few of these ideas . The Aristotelian notion of catharsis , the purging of emotion , is a persistent and viable one .

      <context> In other studies , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned_reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatments , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes . It has further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ( 2 ) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned_reactions ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned_stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned_reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing ( alerting ) effect on the EEG . These are few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned_reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes . The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of <head>emotion</head> . If this is the case , one would expect that not_only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional_state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise .

We pointed_out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic_disorders and neurotic symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( `` abreaction '' ) may cure a battle neurosis . This phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the <head>emotions</head> for therapeutic ends may_not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses . Being a strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself . Wolpe 's experiments and therapeutic work lie_in this area . He showed convincingly that anxiety is a learned ( conditioned_)_reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed , therefore , that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional and reversible .</context>

      <context> Appropriate experiments showed that this is , indeed , possible . He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses . He took advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established . For the interpretation of these significant investigations , it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions which are closely associated with the <head>emotions</head> . The feeding pain antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the tropho - and ergotropic systems . Furthermore , a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety . Although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present , different autonomic somatic patterns underlie aggression and anxiety , respectively , as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines , the state of the muscle_tone , and the Mecholyl_test .</context>

      <context> It seems to follow that by_and_large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as_far_as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . In_addition , the neocortical hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates . But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such_as the rat , sex_activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral_brain is enhanced by the neocortex . MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral_brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic_brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on <head>emotions</head> related_to fight and flight and also on sexual functions . It should be added that in man neocortical hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity . Previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response . The visceral_brain as_well_as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory , but this topic is beyond the scope of this paper .</context>

      <context> Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state . The belief in immortality , where held , functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here_and_now . The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance . The feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as_well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving_vent to <head>emotions</head> and energies . In providing for these inner individual functions , religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace_of_mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution . In_addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society . The two have never been separable .</context>

      <context> Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met . This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard_to the wishes of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy_chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair - in_short , behaving as if I owned her room . Here a variety of meanings and <head>emotions</head> are concentrated , or reduced , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement . One finds , for_example , that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression , seeming at_first to be a mere hollow convention , reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings , and the most unconventional of meanings . More_than anything , it is the therapist 's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a spread-out deck_of_cards , on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient 's and his months of work together . one cannot assume , of_course , that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later_on when the stereotype was uttered ; probably it is correct to think_of it as a matter of a well grooved , stereotyped mode of expression - and no , or but a_few , other communicational grooves , as_yet - being there , available for the patient 's use , as newly emerging emotions and ideas well_up in him over the course of months .</context>

      <context> It is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient 's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding_sway . One learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone - to his voice 's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrotlike . The content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph_needle were stuck in one groove ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over_and_over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo <head>emotion</head> , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . Eventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior - which , as_usual , went_on without any accompanying words from her - she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny '' ? At_first I did not know what she meant ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home city . Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch .</context>

      <context> In my experience , a great many_of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience . Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene . Recently , for_example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was . Or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and <head>emotion</head> when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a simile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking . Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is , more_often_than_not , entirely unaware . His subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one . One hebephrenic women confided to me , `` I live in a world of words '' , as if , to her , words were fully concrete objects ; Burnham , in his excellent article ( 1955 ) concerning schizophrenic communication , includes mention of similar clinical material .</context>
