      <context> It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high_fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener . The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope since Feyer 's four-sided LP edition of 1958 for Angel ) , this set is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment . The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari 's melodramatic contrasts between ultra vehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality . And in its engineers ' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic <head>impact</head> and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super high_fidelity '' . The home listener is overpowered , all_right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one . As with the penultimate Giselle release ( Wolff 's abridgment for RCA_Victor ) I find the cleaner , less razor edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable - but this may be the result of processing defects in my SD copies .</context>

      <context> At what stage are social_sciences then ? Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud . And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their <head>impact</head> . Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man . Constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor_unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world_courts , and the veto power in world_councils are but a_few examples . Most_of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it .</context>

      <context> Meanwhile , other air_defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message . The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans . Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic_missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and deployed , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental_ballistic_missile . The <head>impact</head> of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the high energy fuel program . This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a high energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bombers . Continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel , coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the high energy fuel program . As a result , the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed .</context>

      <context> The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . Throughout the history of the program , state_government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures , while local districts all_together have spent more_than either Federal or state_governments . Today , Federal funds account_for only one-fifth of the nation 's expenditures for vocational education . The greatest <head>impact</head> of the matching fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds . National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades . During World_War 2 , about 7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) Vocational Education for National Defense , and ( 2 ) War Production Training . The total cost of the five year program was $ 297 million .</context>

      <context> Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence . Related_to , but distinguishable from , nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another . Increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions . The efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions , particularly when taken in conjunction with the <head>impact</head> of industrialization , led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions . Law became a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking_to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms . Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no_longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed . The old way of doing things , which depended_on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no_longer adequate_to the task .</context>

      <context> The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent . On all sides doors were being slammed in his face . The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity . Now , under the <head>impact</head> of his wife 's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be . He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half_sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted_in would involve them in a common ruin . For_the_moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity . But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing .</context>
