      <context> The record_books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace . In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as_many_as 25 home_runs and stole as_many_as 25 bases . Once the figure was 30 - 30 . Willie 's <head>lifetime</head> batting average of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's . The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick_Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park . It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . THE DENVER-AREA TV_audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home_runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob_Howsam that the games are not to be blacked_out when his Bears are playing at_home .</context>

A splendid vote_of_confidence in Thayer , Madden reflected . Tenure , too . Very nice for him .</context>
