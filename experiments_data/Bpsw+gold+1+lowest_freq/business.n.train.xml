      <context> A customer ( sometimes known as a client , buyer <head>,</head> or purchaser ) is the recipient of a Good or a service , or a product , or an idea , obtained from a seller , vendor , or supplier via a financial transaction or exchange for money or some other valuable consideration . Etymologically , a client is someone merely inclined to do business , whereas a purchaser procures goods or services on occasion but a customer customarily or habitually engages in transactions .</context>

      <context> Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ?

This problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of <head>businesses</head> . Have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ?

      <context> Look_for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes . There are slums in the country as_well as in the city . Few rural_areas are protected by zoning . A tavern , filling_station , junk_yard , rendering plant , or some other <head>business</head> may go_up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value .

If these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more_than you expect .</context>

      <context> This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement . Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism . I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North . In <head>business</head> circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found . But in our case - and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts - the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come_close to wrecking several more . In_fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down . Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up_against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .</context>

      <context> Persons developed in to-day 's corporations cannot hope to serve here - a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside . In my own company , in_effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , I have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal '' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do . Also , I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow employees . Any abilities I may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing_in the growth and control of my <head>business</head> , coupled with raising my family . This combined experience , on a foundation of very average , I assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against . Perhaps a list of some of the `` practices '' of my company will help here . The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles .</context>

      <context> No amount of ballyhoo will cover_up the sordid facts . If we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it . First , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per_se cannot take economic leadership . <head>Businesses</head> must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind . When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism . The biggest loss , of_course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy . Socialism , I grant , has a definite place in our society .</context>

      <context> It is , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not_only has Mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure . He has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer ( his records have sold in the millions ) and is a sharp businessman . He has also an extraordinary conscience . In 1927 his father 's <head>business</head> collapsed , and , rather_than go bankrupt , Mercer senior turned his firm over to a bank for liquidation . He died before he could completely pay_off his debts . Some years later the bank handling the Mercer liquidation received a check for $ 300000 , enough to clear_up the debt . The check had been mailed from Chicago , the envelope bore no return_address , and the check was not signed .</context>

      <context> `` That 's Johnny '' , sighed the bank president , `` the best hearted boy in the world , but absent-minded '' . But Mercer 's explanation was simple : `` I made_out the check and carried it around a_few days unsigned - in_case I lost it '' . When he remembered that he might have not signed the check , Mercer made_out another for the same amount , instructing the bank to destroy the other - especially if he had happened_to have absent-mindedly signed both of them . When the family <head>business</head> failed , Mercer left school and on his mother 's urging - for she hoped that he would become an actor - he joined a local little theater group . When the troupe traveled_to New_York to participate in a one act play competition - and won - Mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in New_York . He had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah . But Mercer hung_on , living , after_a_fashion , in a Greenwich_Village fourth flight walk-up .</context>

      <context> With_respect_to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their illusions , we can afford to wait , for in_time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see .

We should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities , state and provincial governments , rural communities , and other smaller groups , making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected . Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships of technical progress in various fields , showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education , how health affects labor productivity , how small <head>business</head> can benefit the rural farm community , and , above_all , how progress in each field relates to national progress . Efforts such_as the Community_Development_Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development .

      <context> There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams . Manchester 's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev._J._D._Wickham , headmaster of Burr and Burton_Seminary , was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , Samuel_F._B._Morse . At_any_rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington .

Shares of capital_stock at $ 15 each in the latter company were payable at the Bank_of_Manchester or at various other Vermont banks . A message of less_than fifteen words to Bennington cost twenty-five cents .</context>

      <context> The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in selecting his plant site . Until internal_combustion became cheap , he had_to be near a railroad_siding and a trolley_line or an existing large community of lower-class homes . The railroad_siding is still important - it is usually , though not always , true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper than trucking . But anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many <head>businesses</head> can live without the railroad . And there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking_lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush_hour traffic and grille route bus_lines , is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory . Willow_Run , General_Electric 's enormous installations at Louisville and Syracuse , the Pentagon , Boeing in Seattle , Douglas and Lockheed in Los_Angeles , the new automobile assembly plants everywhere - none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass_rapid_transit . They are all suburban plants , relying_on the roads to keep them supplied with workers .</context>

      <context> The plants along Route_128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New_England rocks and trees . They can even be rather grand , like Edward_Land 's monument to the astonishing success of Polaroid . But they deny the values of the city - the crowded , competitive , tolerant city , the `` melting_pot '' which gave_off so many of the most admirable American qualities . They are segregated <head>businesses</head> , combining again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work_force from segregated communities . It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts ' Route_128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements , or from the exploitation of patents which grant at_least a partial monopoly . While the factories were always the center of the labor_market , they were often on the city 's periphery . In spreading the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities .</context>

The safe is a repository for three dead flashlight_batteries , a_hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint cards , a stack of unsold Policemen's_Ball tickets from last year , and thirty-seven cents in coins and stamps . Gun set the captain 's fifth of Hiram_Walker inside the safe before he reported to Lt._Killpath , though he knew that Killpath 's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on Herman_Wolff 's gift .
