      <context> Why ? Companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies - in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged R_+_D facilities , faster new product development . Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge . Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your <head>company</head> face in the next 10 yr. ? Based on our experience with clients , we see 14 major problems which fall_into three broad groups - the market_place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management . There has been an intensification of price consciousness in recent years ; there is every indication it will continue . Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers .</context>

      <context> Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully - and with some imagination ? In your sales_force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make_out better with a larger number of lower paid salesmen ? Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in_return_for some benefit they can share ? In one <head>company</head> covering the country with a high quality sales_force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos. . As a result , distribution_costs were cut , customer relations improved . Distribution_costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties - and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job .

From the manufacturer 's point_of_view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties . It is accentuated by the need for pre selling goods , and private label competition . How much fundamental thinking and research has your <head>company</head> done on its advertising program ? Are you following competition willy-nilly - trying to match dollar for dollar - or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers ? Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program - from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ?

Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision .

This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute .

      <context> Notice , however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per_se , without an accompanying wage increase . Similarly , higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase . This is not extended to anticipated levels of GNP , however - only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against wage price increases . Finally , since the public requires some restraint on the part of the <head>companies</head> , larger wage increases call_for less_than proportionately larger price increases ( e._g. , if a wage increase of 5 % allows a price increase of 7 % , a wage increase of 10 % allows a price increase of something less_than 14 % ) .

      <context> Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit_margins related to a productivity increase should be shared . The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity share increases as distinct from a cost raising increase in the basic wage rate . We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price level increases may offset wage rate increases , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate .

Changes in the basic wage rate are cost raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices . However , it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude .
