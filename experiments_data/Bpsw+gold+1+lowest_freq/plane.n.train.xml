      <context> Cuban S._S._R. : Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro held mainland last week , there was at_least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian dominated military base . In_fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment . Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought_home to all_of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home . Russian tanks and <head>planes</head> in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United_States , violate the Monroe_Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin_American republic . Once the full extent of_this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President_Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone . But the Latin_American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American_Defense_Board . For years the United_States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro 's representative from secret military talks .</context>

The Navy , on April 25 , announced it is bringing_back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean , increasing to four the number of attack_carriers in the vicinity of Cuba .
