      <context> Thus , in `` The_Story_of_Ruth '' we have Ruth , Naomi , and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic . But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline - i.e. , that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound_up with Boaz - the film version has little to do with the Bible . And in the new `` King_of_Kings '' the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the Gospels . Earlier this month Edward_R._Murrow , director of the United_States_Information_Agency , came to Hollywood and had dinner with more_than 100 leaders of the motion_picture <head>industry</head> . He talked_about unauthentic storylines too . He intimated that they were n't doing the country much good in the Cold_War .

      <context> Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics . We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry . The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality . When we consider the electronic <head>industry</head> potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering . The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic_equipment has enormous possibilities . The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by_far than any previous medical discovery . We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research .</context>

      <context> The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand .

Help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level . The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their <head>industry</head> trade association . Since SAAMI 's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone_into the development of more places to_shoot for more youths and adults . We trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment . Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ?</context>

      <context> Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final_Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living_space through violence , economic_strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . In_other_words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted_on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder . This , in_fact , it turned_out to be . Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German <head>industries</head> , social institutions , and armed_forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of_it , conscious accomplices of Hitler 's crimes ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually . What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man_of_affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No_doubt many_of the citizens of the Third_Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today .</context>

      <context> Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time . This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician 's tricks produced on film . It was Porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued . The movie was The Great_Train_Robbery and its effects on the young <head>industry</head> and art were all_but incalculable . Overnight , for_one_thing , Porter 's film multiplied the standard running_time of movies by ten . The Great_Train_Robbery is a one reel film . One reel - from eight to twelve minutes - became the standard length from the year of Robbery , 1903 , until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth_of_a_Nation in 1915 .</context>

      <context> The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold ; the headsman swung his axe ; the head dropped off ; end of film . An early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo_Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage . In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large_numbers from the simple-minded , one minute shows . In response , the <head>industry</head> allowed the discovery of the motion_picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day . Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at_heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short_story . Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature . Thus such great American documentaries as The_River and The_Plow_That_Broke_the_Plains were composed as visual stories rather_than as illustrated lectures .</context>

      <context> The Farm_Credit_Administration , an independent agency located within the Department_of_Agriculture , supervises and coordinates a cooperative credit_system for agriculture . The system is composed of three credit services , Federal_Land_Banks and National_Farm_Loan_Associations , Federal_Intermediate ( short-term ) Credit_Banks , and Banks_for_Cooperatives . This system provides long - and short-term credit to farmers and their cooperative marketing , purchasing , and business service organizations . As a source of investment capital , the system is beneficial to local communities and encourages the development of <head>industries</head> in rural_areas . The credit provdied by the first two services in the system outlined above is primarily for general agricultural purposes . The third credit service , Banks_for_Cooperatives , exists under authority of the Farm_Credit_Act_of_1933 . The Banks_for_Cooperatives were established to provide a permanent source of credit on a sound basis for farmers ' cooperatives .</context>

      <context> Another problem is who will pay for the training . Local school districts are hard_pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training . Programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business_leaders demand it . Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new <head>industry</head> is in_sight and requests it . State_governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational_schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities . Only the Federal_government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs . If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states .</context>

We assume that average total unit_cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with_respect_to quantity produced ( the average_cost curve is horizontal , and therefore is identical with the marginal_cost curve ) , and is the same for every firm ( and therefore for the <head>industry</head> ) . The level of this average_cost is determined by factor prices , technology , and_so_forth . As we have noted , however , we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate . The level of average_cost ( equal to marginal_cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate .</context>

      <context> Since marginal_costs rise when the wage rate rises , the profit_maximizing price also rises when the public limit price is elevated , and is likely to remain well above the latter . The entry limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic competition , but unless general inflation permits profit_margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy , we might expect the public limit price to approach the entry limit price . The foreign entry limit price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage rates do not enter foreign costs directly . Where this approach becomes critical , the <head>industry</head> can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure . Whether or not it is in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends_upon the extent to which the public limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase . The extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase . We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put_up by the industry .</context>
