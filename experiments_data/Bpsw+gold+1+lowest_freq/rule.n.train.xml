      <context> Regulation is an abstract concept of management <head>of</head> complex systems according to a set of rules and trends . In systems theory , these types of rules exist in various fields of biology and society , but the term has slightly different meanings according to context .</context>

      <context> Committee approval of Gov._Price_Daniel 's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered_down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House_Committee_on_Revenue_and_Taxation . Under committee <head>rules</head> , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . But questions with which committee_members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of_it . Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal_year next Aug. 31 . He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on_the_books `` since Texas was a republic '' .</context>

      <context> By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a <head>rule</head> of law '' . I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed .

      <context> The hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching_method was supported , in this case , at the .05 level . While we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured , we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the whole-word_method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives . Indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant . We speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic <head>rules</head> and achieve in_spite_of the lack of direction from the environment . It is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores ( although not significantly lower ) . Possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure . Our conjecture is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work .</context>

      <context> The phonemic_systems which must support these morphophonemic_systems , however , are very different . The inventory of tones is much smaller , and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension , pitch level . Consonantal_systems are not merely larger , they are multidimensional . Morphophonemic <head>rules</head> may be thought_of as joining certain points in the system . The possibilities in the consonantal_system are very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually used . Phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity , possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system . Tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone .</context>

      <context> the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as_well as their more remote and elusive external links ; of classification first , with elapsed age merely a by-product ; of acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened in Athabascan , in Yokuts , in Uto-Aztecan in the last few thousand years as_well as forecasting what more anciently may have happened between them . This involves step-by-step progress , and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry . If of the founders of glottochronology Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding , and Lees has repudiated his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should swerve . There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by Swadesh 's <head>rules</head> and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown so vast . It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble , solid , and limited basis . I would propose , first , an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved . I would propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible .</context>

      <context> Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed countries . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular <head>rules</head> governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality .</context>

      <context> The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality . It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for <head>rules</head> that might limit his freedom of action . To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy . First , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity . National identification was not new , but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new unifications occurred .</context>
