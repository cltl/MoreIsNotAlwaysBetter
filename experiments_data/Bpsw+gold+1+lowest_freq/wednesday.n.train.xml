      <context> For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in_public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 . Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia . Although Rhode_Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John_Brown 's trial with extreme interest . On <head>Wednesday</head> morning , November_2 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fairer trial . The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted . The readers of the Providence_Daily_Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old_Brown '' had a fair trial . Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' .</context>

      <context> `` E._B. '' compared John_Brown to Moses in_that they were both acting to deliver millions from oppression . In contrast to `` E._B.

On <head>Wednesday</head> evening , November 23 , 1859 , in Warren , Rev._Mark_Trafton of New_Bedford , gave a `` Mission_of_Sympathy '' lecture in which he favorably viewed the Harper_'s_Ferry insurrection . The Warren_Telegraph stated that many of Rev._Trafton 's remarks were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism . In its account of the Trafton lecture , the Providence_Daily_Post said that the remarks of Rev._Trafton made the people indignant . No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence_Daily_Post , for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state_prison who were a_thousand times more deserving of sympathy .</context>
