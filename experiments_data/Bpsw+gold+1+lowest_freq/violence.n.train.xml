      <context> A_couple_of the males made good comedy , too - Jim_Hutton and Frank_Gorshin . The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette_Mimieux , but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , I suppose this was the attitude the part called_for . I must say , however , that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it . To anyone who remembers Newport at its less_than maximum <head>violence</head> , this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz_Festival ought to prove entertaining . The second feature , `` The_Price_of_Silence '' , is a British detective_story that will talk_your_head_off .</context>

      <context> The `` chase '' as a standard film device probably dates_from The_Great_Train_Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device . The chase in itself is a narrative ; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting - both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not_only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for <head>violence</head> ; these films and these sequences are also seeking_out - instinctively or by_design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative . There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . The man was D.W._Griffith . When he came to the movies - more_or_less by accident - they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes .</context>
