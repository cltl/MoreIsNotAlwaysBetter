The hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic_hormone . At the present_time we do not know by what biochemical_mechanism TSH acts_on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of * * f . Here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the <head>concentration</head> of TSH in blood . Brown ( 1959 ) has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying TSH , and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject .

      <context> Since the circulating thyroid_hormones are the amino_acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine ( cf. Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid_gland for their release from proteins before secretion . The presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid . One of the proteases has pH optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 ( McQuillan , Stanley and Trikojus , 1954 ; Alpers , Robbins and Rall , 1955 ) . The finding that the <head>concentration</head> of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid_glands from TSH treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in_vivo . There is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known . A study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediates ( Alpers , Petermann and Rall , 1956 ) . Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes .</context>

      <context> It has been suggested that the plasma thyroxine binding proteins , which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine , compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ( Ingbar and Freinkel , 1957 ) . Antithyroid drugs are of two general types . One type has a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate perchlorate fluoroboride type . This ion inhibits thyroid_hormone synthesis by interfering with iodide <head>concentration</head> in the thyroid . It does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as_such . The other group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil . These drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism , but they inhibit organification .</context>

      <context> In the midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . The high cost of land and a_few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . Research at Fayette_, Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg / l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb BOD / day / acre . Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD <head>concentrations</head> , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen / hr / hp . O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes .</context>

      <context> It was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and corrected , but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen . A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate . Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover . The rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 - mg / l dissolved oxygen <head>concentration</head> and 10 ` C for various rotor speeds is given in Table 3 , . The maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 mg / l dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lb / day at a maximum rate of 9.3 mg / l / hr . The actual power requirements indicated 2 lb oxygen transfer / hr / hp . The polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per_cent , indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather_than through the surface .</context>

The organic <head>concentration</head> in the influent raw sewage ranged from 160 to 270 mg / l of BOD with an average of 230 mg / l . The BOD data are given in Table 4 , .
