The Orioles once_again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas_City pitchers . Three were doubles , Brooks_Robinson getting a pair and Marv_Breeding one . Bill_Kunkel , Bob_Hartman and Ed_Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West_Palm_Beach to play the <head>game</head> before 767 paying customers in Miami_Stadium . The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took_over in the top of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee_Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning appearance , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally .</context>
