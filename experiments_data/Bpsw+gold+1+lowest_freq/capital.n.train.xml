      <context> " The economic formation of society [ is ] a process of natural history " , thus it is possible for a political economist to objectively study the scientific <head>laws</head> of capitalism , given that its expansion of the market system of commerce had objectified human economic relations ; the use of money ( cash nexus ) voided religious and political illusions about its economic value , and replaced them with commodity fetishism , the belief that an object ( commodity ) has inherent economic value . Because societal economic formation is a historical process , no one person could control or direct it , thereby creating a global complex of social connections among capitalists ; thus , the economic formation ( individual commerce ) of a society precedes the human administration of an economy ( organised commerce ) . After two decades of economic study and preparatory work ( especially regarding the theory of surplus value ) the first volume appeared in 1867 : The production process of capital .</context>
