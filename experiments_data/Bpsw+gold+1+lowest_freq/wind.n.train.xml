      <context> A wind instrument is a <head>musical</head> instrument that contains some type of resonator ( usually a tube ) , in which a column of air is set into vibration by the player blowing into ( or over ) a mouthpiece set at the end of the resonator . The pitch of the vibration is determined by the length of the tube and by manual modifications of the effective length of the vibrating column of air . In the case of some wind instruments , sound is produced by blowing through a reed ; others require buzzing into a metal mouthpiece .</context>
