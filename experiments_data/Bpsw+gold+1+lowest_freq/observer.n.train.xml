      <context> Therefore , neglecting the extreme outbursts , reflected solar_radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter - and decimeter wave-length range . Radio_observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave_lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm , and the results are summarized in Table 1 . Observations have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques ( Sinton , 1955 , 1956 , ; see_also chap. 11 ) . Not all the <head>observers</head> have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness distribution when reducing the data , and this , together with differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers , must account_for much of the disagreement in the measured radio_brightness temperatures . In the observations at 4.3 mm ( Coates , 1959 a ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , 6 ' .7 , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface , and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases . These observations indicate that the lunar maria heat_up more rapidly and also cool_off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions . Mare_Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it .</context>

      <context> Apparently academic challenge in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so_that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or panicked . Sarason et_al. present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test like situation , and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher . Although the present study was not a direct replication of their investigations , the results do not confirm their conclusion . <head>Observers</head> , in the two school_systems studied here , judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and demanding , while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting . Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting .</context>

      <context> Turnover rates of personnel went_up , production dropped , and morale was visibly reduced . Despite the fact that he was regarded_as an outstanding engineer , he seemed to be a very poor administrator , although no one quite knew what was wrong with him . At the insistence of his own supervisor - the president of the firm , he enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders . He played a number of typical situations before <head>observers</head> , other supervisors who kept notes and then explained to him in_detail what he did they thought was wrong . Entirely concerned with efficiency , he was merciless in criticizing people who made mistakes , condemning them to too great an extent . He did not really listen to others , had little interest in their ideas , and wanted to have his own way - which was the only right way . The entire group of managers explained , in great detail , a number of human relations errors that he made .</context>

      <context> However , in this case the district_manager was led to see the errors of his ways . The necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms . How this was accomplished may be described , since this sometimes is a crucial problem . The director helped tailor-make a check_list of the district_manager 's errors by asking various <head>observers</head> to write_out sentences commenting on the mistakes they felt he made . These errors were then collected and written on a blackboard , condensing similar ideas . Eighteen errors were located , and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors . They were asked to vote `` true '' if they thought they had seen him make the error , `` false '' if they thought he had not ; and `` cannot say '' if they were not certain .</context>

      <context> To use these new ways in daily life is the last step . Roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to training . When an evaluative situation is set_up , and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate , we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation . <head>Observers</head> can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion . This behavior is more `` veridical '' - or true than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning . While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure . The objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts .</context>

      <context> One handled the salesman in a friendly manner , another in a rough manner , and the third in a hesitating manner . Each was told to purchase material if he felt_like it . The antagonists came_in , one_at_a_time , and did not see or hear the other presentations . After each presentation , the antagonist wrote his judgment of the salesmen ; and so did the <head>observers</head> consisting_of the president , three of his salesmen and a psychologist . Ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon . This procedure was repeated one day a month for four months . The batting_average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three .</context>

      <context> The position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions . All applicants were generally familiar_with the work of the receptionist . At the end of work one day , the personnel man took the applicants one_at_a_time , asked them to sit behind the receptionist 's desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes . Each girl was independently `` tested '' by the personnel man , and he served not_only as the director , but as the antagonist and the <head>observer</head> . Somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl , whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time , did the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist , showing wit , sparkle , and aplomb . She was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day . In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no_longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning .</context>

      <context> To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . At_the_least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . And perhaps an <head>observer</head> of the vases will not go_too_far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . The storms of the past had died_away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not_yet begun to disturb men 's minds . Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself . In the vases this spirit may perhaps at_times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world .</context>

      <context> The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree . Much which was in_embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 . In this process the Minoan Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected ; the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800 . Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times - granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside - are correct ; but all_too many <head>observers</head> have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took_place in the early first millennium . The focus of novelty in this world now lay_in the south-eastern districts of the Greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean , always excepting its northern shores , had accepted the Geometric style of pottery . While Protogeometric vases usually turn_up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as_many or more examples of local stamp , these `` non Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century . In their place came local variations within the common style - tentative , as_it_were , in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed .</context>
