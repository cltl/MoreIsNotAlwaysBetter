      <context> If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . The world 's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening <head>round</head> of the Los_Angeles_open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . He boomed a 280 - yard drive . Then the pixies and the zombies took_over while the banshees wailed in the distance . On the narrow fairway of a 508 - yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot .</context>

      <context> As_soon_as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken_over , cut it off from the mother plant . A second and also good practice is to shear off the tops , leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch . These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring . I like to shear half my plants at_a_time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second_half is getting_started on its new <head>round</head> of blooming . Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed . Nature 's aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation . That done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant .</context>

      <context> We can escape_from such a difficulty by ruling_out the animal as not constituting a trial , but such a solution is not always satisfactory . Each die has probability * * f of producing an ace ; the marksman has some probability p , perhaps 0.1 , of making a bull's-eye . Note that we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial . During a <head>round</head> of target_practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles the marksman , lowering his chance of a bull's-eye . Strictly_speaking , this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials . Thus in the three dice example * * f , * * f , and the independence assumption implies that the probability that the three dice fall ace , not ace , ace in that order is ( 1 6 ) ( 5 6 ) ( 1 6 ) . Experimentally , we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another .</context>
