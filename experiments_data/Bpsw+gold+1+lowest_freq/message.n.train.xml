      <context> Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its <head>message</head> on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach . In 1959 SAAMI 's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports . This program is now nationally known_as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' . Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied_Merchandising_Corporation .</context>

      <context> Of what new course could it mark the beginning ? The Eichmann case looked_to the past , not to the future .

As_such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` <head>message</head> '' . `` It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial '' - said Ben_Gurion , `` and not the Nazi regime alone - but anti-Semitism throughout history '' . How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-Semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ? And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all_but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a `` fiend '' ?</context>

      <context> Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro community . Occasionally they would write to the slaves . Early in the war it was not uncommon for planters ' sons to retain in camp Negro `` body_servants '' to perform the menial chores such_as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoes , and laundering clothes . Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier masters <head>messages</head> to their relatives and to members of their owners ' families . Unmarried soldiers carried_on correspondence with sweethearts at home . Owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19_th century America , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling . Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond , Petersburg , Washington , or Nashville .</context>

      <context> Since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such_as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar_maple camp . Location theorists have given these matters much consideration . The networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not_only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war . They also furnish proof that , in modern war , <head>message</head> sending must be monitored . Without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy party . The need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling . Alexander_the_Great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at_once .</context>

      <context> This objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action . The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting_as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village . The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( a ) One man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too_much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc. . ( b ) A <head>message</head> runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times . ( c ) Decisions of a general kind are made by the central command . And ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower_rank . These assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and_so_on until there are six levels of personnel .</context>

      <context> Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long range interceptor with a speed three_times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid 1960 's . The substantial progress being made in ballistic_missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles . Considering the high cost of the F-108 system - over $ 4 billion for the force that had been planned - and the time_period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project . Meanwhile , other air_defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this <head>message</head> . The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans . Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic_missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and deployed , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental_ballistic_missile . The impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the high energy fuel program .</context>

      <context> Orvis even needed to hire an assistant , Clark_J._Wait . The Manchester_Journal commented editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business . In the fall of 1878 , the `` Popular_Telegraph_Line '' was established between Manchester and Factory_Point by the owners , Paul_W._Orvis , Henry_Gray , J._N._Hard , and Clark_J._Wait . The line soon lived_up_to its name , as local <head>messages</head> of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital_stock . In 1879 the same Clark_Wait , with H._H._Holley of South_Dorset , formed the `` American_Telegraph_Line '' , extending from Manchester_Depot via Factory_Point and South_Dorset to Dorset . Besides being most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good investment for the owners '' . Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron_C._Burr and Mark_Manley of `` Burr_and_Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry_goods .</context>
