      <context> I am naive , they say , to make use of such words . I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? - liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as_well_as democratic processes may have to yield before it . This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a <head>President</head> of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme_Court . As for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms . The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one . Why , in_the_first_place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ?</context>

      <context> Most assuredly ideas are invaluable . But ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough . In the 1930 's , cures for the depression literally flooded Washington . For a time the <head>President</head> received hundreds of them every_day , most_of them worthless . Ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate . When some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for_instance , we do not turn_to free and open discussion as in a political_campaign . We have recourse to the scientifically trained specialist in the laboratory .</context>

      <context> Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron_C._Burr and Mark_Manley of `` Burr_and_Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry_goods . Early equipment was very flimsy ; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles , making communications impossible . But companies continued to spring_up . By 1883 the `` Battenkill_Telegraph_Company '' was in existence and Alvin_Pettibone was its <head>president</head> . Operating in 1887 was the `` Valley_Telegraph_Line '' , officers of which were E._C._Orvis , president ; H._K._Fowler , vice-president and secretary ; J._N._Hard , treasurer ; F._H._Walker , superintendent ; H._S._Walker , assistant superintendent . Two companies now had headquarters with Clark_J._Wait , who by then had his own drugstore at Factory_Point - the `` Northern_Union_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Western_Union '' . Operators were Arthur_Koop and Norman_Taylor .</context>

      <context> What are your weaknesses ? Where will you break ? How best to destroy your peace ? The Vice_President said with a slight bluster , `` There is n't anyone who loves the <head>President</head> more_than I do . Old_Chris is my ideal .

      <context> Congress is full of politicians , and if you want to get_along_with them , you have_to be politic . This is why I say we just can't go_ahead and disarm the Germans and pull_down our own defenses . Let me tell you what happened to me today . A fellow came_up_to me , a Senator , I do n't have_to tell you his name , and he told me , ' I love the <head>President</head> like a brother , but God_damn_it , he 's crucifying me . I 've got a quarter of a_million Germans in my state , and those krautheads tune_in on Father_Werther every_night , and if he tells them to go_out and piss in the public_square , that 's what they do . He 's telling them now to write letters to their Congressmen opposing the disarmament of Germany ' . And another one comes to me and he says , ' Look_here , there 's a mill in my state employs five thousand people making uniforms for the Navy .</context>

      <context> She was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash , and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury . This meant sorting_out press_clippings and the_like . Jane sat receptive and interested . Mickie had a pleasant glow as he said , `` You see , both of them , I mean the <head>President</head> and Jeff_Lawrence , are romantics . A romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and all he has_to do is find the right key , and then divine justice and altruism will appear . It 's like focusing a camera ; the distant ship is n't there until you get the focus . You know what I'm talking_about .</context>

      <context> Driving along the caliche-topped road to town , Howard talked . Finally he said , `` Tell me about yourself '' , and Linda_Kay told him , because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life . She was such a well-rounded teenager , having been a twirler , Future_Farmers sweetheart , and secretary of Future_Homemakers . In her sophomore year she had started going_steady with Bobby_Joe , who was a football_player , Future_Homemakers sweetheart , and <head>president</head> of Future_Farmers . It was easy to see that they were made_for each other , and they knew what they wanted . Bobby_Joe would be a senior this year , and he planned to graduate . But there was no need for Linda_Kay to go_on , since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby_Joe and ( blushing ) raise his children .</context>
