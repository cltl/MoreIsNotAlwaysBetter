      <context> If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people '' - and this , it must_not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task - there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation .

His point is not that mythology may_not be used , but that it may no_longer be regarded_as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma . When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence . Mythological concepts may by_all_means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that_is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in non mythological ( or existential ) terms .</context>

      <context> These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified . The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated . Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and_then older and_then still older , in_short , whether Adam 's life was intended to be part of the process of time . If it was , then it must have been God 's <head>intention</head> to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity . One night , so some of these theories run , Adam would have fallen_asleep , much_as he fell_asleep for the creation of Eve ; and thus he would have been carried_over into the life_eternal . The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural_order of time and change . On_the_other_hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence .</context>

      <context> In six months O_'_Banion had boosted the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb . These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; once_again O_'_Banion 's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill_will . The revenue from O_'_Banion 's Cicero territory went_up still higher , until the yield was more_than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago 's South and West_Sides . But he still showed no <head>intention</head> of sharing with the syndicate . At_last , even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O_'_Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in_return for one from his Cicero beer concession . O_'_Banion 's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal . Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O_'_Banion gang 's seizure from a West_Side marshalling_yard of a freight-car load of Canadian whisky worth $ 100000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition_era - the Sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation .</context>

      <context> His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers . Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic_romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in_particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry_James and James_Joyce among them . His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him . My <head>intention</head> , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked_at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by_no_means new with him , and most_of the problems he takes_up have had the attention of authors before him . A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region . The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at_least since John_Pendleton_Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank_Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature .</context>

      <context> They 'd have some suspicions to repeat to the police . Though his inner thoughts cringed at it , he forced himself to think_back , recreating the scene in which Mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child . It had n't amounted to anything . There had been nothing evil or dirty in his <head>intentions</head> . A second scene flashed before his mind , the interior of the garage at the new house and the young Bartlett girl turning startled to meet him , the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as Mae had clicked on the light . Suppose the cops somehow got hold of that ? Well , it had n't been what it seemed , he 'd had no idea the girl was in there .</context>

      <context> The aimless milling_about of_what had been a well trained , well organized crew struck Alexander with horror . He bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction . Adrien_Deslonde hastened to Alexander 's side . `` Small violently jerked the weather royal_brace with full <head>intention</head> to carry_away the mast .
