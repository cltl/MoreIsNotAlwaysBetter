      <context> The continuous nature of time and its infinite divisibility was addressed by Aristotle in his Physics , where he wrote on Zeno 's paradoxes <head>.</head> The philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell was still seeking to define the exact nature of an instant thousands of years later . As of May 2010 , the smallest time interval that was directly measured was on the order of 12 attoseconds ( 12 × 10−18 seconds ) , about 1024 times larger than the Planck time .</context>

      <context> Whitey_Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base_on_balls . Then three consecutive pinch_hitters failed to produce . Pete_Ward was sent in_for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short . John_Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2 - and 2 pitches , and Buddy_Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced_out sharply to Jerry_Lumpe at <head>second</head> to end the 2 - hour and - 27 - minute contest . The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ_Snyder 's single to right and crossed on Kunkel 's wild_pitch into the dirt in_front of the plate . The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out . Jackie_Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally .</context>

      <context> The discarded papers inside were sodden , there was a glint of liquid at the bottom , and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct . He put the basket down distastefully , muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so foolproof . For he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and_then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself . For another <head>second</head> or two he gave_in to the annoyance that was directed at himself ; then his mind moved_on to be confronted by something far more serious , and as the thought expanded , the implications jarred him . It no_longer mattered that Burton had outsmarted him . The important thing was that Burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket . And that gun was empty .</context>

      <context> Arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came_by . He was very rude . Arlene had a hard voice , too , this time . The policeman 's eyes rather popped for a <head>second</head> ; but then Arlene got another tone in a hurry , and she said , `` If it was n't for these dear children '' - . The policeman got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind_of politely , `` Now , look_here , lady : I know you got to entertain these kids and all . But this is a public park and it 's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on '' . Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir '' .</context>
