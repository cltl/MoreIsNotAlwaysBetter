      <context> At 6_o_'_clock on the morning of August 12 , they were in doubt no_longer . Then it came , against Troop_H . The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with Russian machine_guns , attacked the position held by Chandler 's men . They came in <head>waves</head> . First came the cannon_fodder , white clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering_ram . They were followed by crack North_Korean troops , who mounted one charge after another . They overran the 7_th_Cav 's forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers , over piles of_their_own dead .</context>

      <context> The primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impressed us . What one actually remembers is its greenness . From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible . One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking <head>wave</head> of flower . Every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit_trees . In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet_shrub , snowball , rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead . From above one could only occasionally catch_a_glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block .</context>

He looked over at him , lying there , asleep , and he felt a <head>wave</head> of revulsion . How he loathed him . Sleepy-eyed , soft-spoken Johnson . Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad .</context>

      <context> `` I asked her why she could n't do it tomorrow , but it seems the muse is working good tonight and she 's afraid to let_it_go '' . Casey made some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man . His name was George_Needham and he , too , had come from a good family . He was perhaps thirty-two , nicely set_up , with light_brown hair that had a pronounced <head>wave</head> . He was always well groomed and well tailored , and he had that rich_man 's look which was authentic enough and came from two good prep_schools and a proper university . An only child , he had done all the things that young_men do who have been born to money and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke . Since then he had worked_at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling .</context>

      <context> I drank furiously . A long time . Emptied the bottle . Teeth again flashing back at me , the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which `` amigo '' appeared every_so_often like an island in the stormy <head>waves</head> of surrounding sound . I bobbed my head each time it appeared . Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son_of_a_bitch '' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer_bottle into Johnson 's quivering ribs . A big car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning .</context>
