Deficiencies can be due to a number of causes including inadequacy in nutrient intake called dietary deficiency , or conditions that interfere with the utilization of a nutrient within an organism .</context>

      <context> And unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado . It is thick , much like an egg_plant 's skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the consumer . Good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited . Avocados , however , are very rich_in <head>nutrients</head> . Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty_acids , so necessary for maintaining the good_health of the circulatory_system . Aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamins and C - about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin_E requirement . The B_vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin .</context>
