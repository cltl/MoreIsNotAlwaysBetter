Long weekends enable many to get_away from home for three or four days several times a year . And even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces . It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they 're buying the comforts of home .</context>

      <context> Seven hundred miles south of York_Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 . By October the little colony about Fort_Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 . Within a_few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called Meurons . The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great_Britain to Canada to fight the <head>Americans</head> in the War_of_1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go_to Red_River where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest_Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire . The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward .</context>

      <context> Of_course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth century United_States . Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man_in_the_street . It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine . After_all , the average <head>American</head> as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control . Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement . Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes . In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose .</context>

      <context> Related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence . Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter . In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this . Enthusiastically , <head>Americans</head> have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul_Bunyan tales , Abe_Lincoln anecdotes and labor_union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition . Nor have we remembered that in the melting_pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material . Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant .</context>

      <context> In_the_first_place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal_system . One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded_as the law_of_nations . Admiralty_law , the law_merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law_of_Nations and made dependent_on the several national laws . Private international_law ( which <head>Americans</head> call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international_law proper , or , as it is often called , public international_law . States were free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , their own rules as_to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law_merchant , and to enact legislation with regard_to many claims arising on the high_seas . The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in_fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations .</context>
