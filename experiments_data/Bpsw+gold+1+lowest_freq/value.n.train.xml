      <context> In neoclassical economics , the value <head>of</head> an object or service is often seen as nothing but the price it would bring in an open and competitive market . This is determined primarily by the demand for the object relative to supply in a perfectly competitive market . Many neoclassical economic theories equate the value of a commodity with its price , whether the market is competitive or not .</context>

      <context> As such , everything is seen as <head>a</head> commodity and if there is no market to set a price then there is no economic value . In classical economics , the value of an object or condition is the amount of discomfort/labor saved through the consumption or use of an object or condition ( Labor Theory of Value ) . Though exchange value is recognized , economic value is not , in theory , dependent on the existence of a market and price and value are not seen as equal .</context>

The economic value of a good or service has puzzled economists since the beginning of the discipline .
