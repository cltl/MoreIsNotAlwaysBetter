      <context> In heraldry , a charge is any emblem or device occupying <head>the</head> field of an escutcheon ( shield ) . This may be a geometric design ( sometimes called an ordinary ) or a symbolic representation of a person , animal , plant , object or other device . In French blazon , the ordinaries are called pi√®ces while other charges are called meubles ( i.e. " mobile " ; this is a homonym of " furniture " in Modern French ) .</context>

      <context> The total is the probable gross income from farming . To find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming . Include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm_buildings and equipment . Also count as an expense a <head>charge</head> for the labor to be contributed by the family . It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it . Otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor . To figure the value of the farm in_terms_of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way .</context>

      <context> This help is offered to applicants who ordinarily would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds from commercial sources on reasonable terms . Each applicant is required to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored . The Government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up_to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses . The applicant pays the rest of the cost , but his own time spent on the work and <head>charges</head> for the use of equipment which he owns may be applied toward his share of the cost . Funds contributed by the Government are repaid by a royalty on production from the property . If nothing is produced , there is no obligation to repay . A 5 - percent royalty is paid on any production during the period the contract is in_effect ; if the Government certifies that production may be possible from the property , the royalty obligation continues for the 10 - year period usually specified in the contract or until the Government 's contribution is repaid with interest .</context>

      <context> An alternate roof , perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach , could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams , overlaid with boards and waterproofing . It would have_to be covered with at_least 28 inches of pit-run gravel . The materials for a double wall shelter would cost about $ 700 . Contractors ' <head>charges</head> would be additional . The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection . Pre shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground . These are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface .</context>

      <context> They form effective fallout_shelters when mounded_over with earth , as shown in figure 10 . Materials for this shelter would cost about $ 700 . A contractor probably would be required to help build it . His <head>charges</head> would be added to the cost of materials . This shelter , as shown on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation . An alternate hatchway entrance , shown on page 25 , would reduce the cost of materials $ 50 to $ 100 . The National_Lumber_Manufacturers_Association , Washington , D._C. , is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction .</context>

      <context> He was fortunate , and proud . The veterans , idling on their benches in the Square , beneath the soldiers ' monument , got_to_their_feet when Papa approached : `` Morning , Reverend '' ! His being and His will - Stevie could not divide God from his Papa - illumined every parish face , turned the choir into a band of angels , and the pulpit into the tollgate to Heaven . `` We have nine hundred and eleven members in our <head>charge</head> '' , Mama announced , `` and three hundred and eighty Sunday-school scholars '' . When Papa went_out to do God 's work , Stevie often accompanied him in the buggy , which was drawn by Violet , the new black mare . Although they journeyed westerly as far as Germantown , beyond the Erie roundhouse and the machine_shop , and along the Delaware and Hudson_Canal , and northward to Brooklyn , below Point_Peter , he could see the church spire wherever he looked_back . Sometimes they went south and rolled past the tollhouse - `` Afternoon , Reverend '' !</context>
