State representatives decided Thursday against taking_a_poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State_Affairs_Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . Rep._Wesley_Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the <head>poll</head> idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West_Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman_Bill_Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice .</context>

      <context> The general Protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' . An action once universally condemned by all Christian_churches and forbidden by the civil_law is now not_only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant_denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty . This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country . Repeated <head>polls</head> have disclosed that most married_couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth_control . For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief .</context>

      <context> My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War . Nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this category . I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to believe . I never heard of a <head>poll</head> being taken on the question . No_doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic . Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy . Since the Supreme_Court 's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little_Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old_South .</context>

Belief in the traditional way_of_life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones . Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South_Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North_Carolina , and Alabama following along after them . Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; so_that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper_limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old_South from the new , but with , of_course , important minority enclaves .</context>
