      <context> The jury said it did find that many_of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . The grand_jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton_County purchasing_departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' . However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the <head>cost</head> of administration '' . The City_Purchasing_Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' . It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem . Implementation of Georgia 's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury .</context>

      <context> State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called_for yesterday in a report of a `` blue_ribbon '' citizens_committee on the aid to dependent children program . The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New_York_City welfare consulting_firm , listed 10 long_range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case_load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . The monthly <head>cost</head> of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C._Virgil_Martin , president of Carson_Pirie_Scott_+_Co. , committee chairman . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend_upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' .</context>

The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced <head>cost</head> to the state . There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . It would authorize the Texas_Education_Agency to establish county-wide day_schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of_age to attend the day_schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas_School_for_the_Deaf here .

      <context> If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the right to say anything at_all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian . Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus_Christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind - sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus - then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid . This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter . Modern man , as Dietrich_Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come_of_age '' ; and though this process by_no_means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in_fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the <head>cost</head> of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it . In_any_event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at_all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen_fit to place us . To say this , of_course , is to take_up a position on one side of a controversy going_on now for some two hundred years , or , at_any_rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought . We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at_least , Bultmann .</context>

      <context> I endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay_rates . - Expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed_Forces are estimated to be $ 10.3 billion in 1961 , which is $ 184 million more than in 1960 . The increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment . A substantial increase is estimated in the <head>cost</head> of operating additional communications_systems in the air defense_program , as_well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential . Also , the program for fleet modernization will be stepped_up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures .

      <context> Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in_sight and requests it . State_governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational_schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities .

However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment . Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate .</context>
