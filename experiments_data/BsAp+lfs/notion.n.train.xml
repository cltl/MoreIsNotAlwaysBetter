      <context> If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people '' - and this , it must_not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task - there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation . This does not mean that mythological language as_such can no_longer be used in theology and preaching . The absurd <head>notion</head> that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann 's intention . His point is not that mythology may_not be used , but that it may no_longer be regarded_as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma . When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence . Mythological concepts may by_all_means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that_is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in non mythological ( or existential ) terms .</context>

      <context> At the nadir of that circuit is death . `` Along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience ; and disobedience to God entails death . Wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that [ moment ] they were handed_over to it '' . This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling <head>notion</head> that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a Friday , as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good_Friday ; he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath . In_any_case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead . The wages of sin is death . Man 's life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with God , must now be conformed_to the shape of death .</context>

      <context> And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at_least uncertain way on the details of how we behave . What elements of our behavior are decisive ? Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? We have staved_off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of_it , since we have not the slightest <head>notion</head> which parts are effective . I think that we are here also talking_of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city . If an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even_though he might not be able to act quickly enough . With the group of boys it is different .</context>

      <context> This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ; it is particularly the artist ( Tonio_Kro^ger , Aschenbach , Leverku^hn ) who suffers from it . The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough '' in the realm of art . Again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child . Finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) <head>notions</head> of dressing_up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with Cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann 's stories . We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates . For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody . Professionally a lawyer , that_is_to_say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed_up , disguised - that_is , paradoxically , revealed - as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child .</context>

      <context> Moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920 s , the dislocations of the Depression , the common ethos of Materialism everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced Mike_Fink and the Great_Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the Little_People .

      <context> It is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by_no_means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research . The student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at_the_same_time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another . Let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought - turning our attention from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades . We may thus trace the <head>notion</head> of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts . Finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at_present widespread . No one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them . Still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature .</context>

      <context> It is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy . An idea , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned . In this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas , that are so_to_speak `` writ_large '' in history of literature where they recur continually . Outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself , including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries ; also secondary <head>notions</head> such_as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man . One might , indeed , argue that the history of ideas , in_so_far as it includes the literatures , must center_on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning . We need not , to_be_sure , expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature . An idea , of the sort that we have_in_mind , although of_necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images , especially those appearing in lyric_poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience .</context>

It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority . Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society .

      <context> To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy . First , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity . National identification was not new , but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new unifications occurred . It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in <head>notions</head> of `` state will '' put_forward by the Germans , especially by Hegel , although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of Hobbes . National identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which incorporated this Hegelian abstraction and saw law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection . In the international community this reduced law to Jellinek 's auto_limitation . A state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of self-will , or consent .</context>
