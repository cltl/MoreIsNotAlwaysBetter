      <context> The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless <head>team</head> among the eighteen Major-League_clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas_City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . Indications as_late_as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory drought as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage . Over the first five frames , Jack_Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in_the_middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American_League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick_Hyde , submarine_ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock .</context>

Two errors by New_York Yankee shortstop Tony_Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned_runs and a 5 - to 2 victory to the Chicago_White_Sox today .</context>

      <context> Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee_Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning appearance , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . Whitey_Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest <head>team</head> of the spring , worked Keegan for a base_on_balls . Then three consecutive pinch_hitters failed to produce . Pete_Ward was sent in_for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short .

      <context> Once the figure was 30 - 30 . Willie 's lifetime batting average of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's . The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick_Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park . It will forever be a baseball mystery how a <head>team</head> will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . THE DENVER-AREA TV_audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home_runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob_Howsam that the games are not to be blacked_out when his Bears are playing at_home . This rule providing_for a blackout of televised baseball 30_minutes before the start of a major or minor_league game in any area comes from the game 's top rulers .

      <context> You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears_Stadium last year because of the television policy . This dissatisfaction led to Howsam 's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game . The powerful New_York Yankees won their 19th world_series in a 5 - game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13 - 5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale . With Mickey_Mantle and Yogi_Berra both out_of_action due_to injuries , the American_League champs still mounted a 15 - hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one <head>team</head> in a series game . Johnny_Blanchard , Mantle 's replacement , slammed a 2 - run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey_Jay in a 5 - run first inning . Hector_Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3 - run homer off Bill_Henry during another 5 - run explosion in the fourth . The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors .</context>

The Yankee triumph made Ralph_Houk only the third man to lead a <head>team</head> to both a pennant and a World_Series victory in his first year as a manager .

The '52 Cards were 6 - 7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club 's top since 1949 . Then last season the_Birds tumbled as low as 11 - 18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . Since 1949 , the only National_League club that got_off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger <head>team</head> . Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 . The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New_York 's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . They honored the battling Billikens last night .</context>

The most_valuable_player award was split three ways , among Glen_Mankowski , Gordon_Hartweger and Tom_Kieffer . In_addition , a special award was given to Bob_(_Bevo_) Nordmann , the 6 - foot - 10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury . `` You often hear people talk_about team_spirit and that sort of thing '' , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this <head>team</head> had was a_little different . The boys had a tremendous respect for each other 's ability . They knew what they could do and it was often a_little more than I thought they could do . `` Several times I found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk .</context>

      <context> Many_of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible_light , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet_spectrum . Different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color .

At the present time the research <head>team</head> which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it . The medical title of `` Lobar_Ventilation_in_Man '' by Drs._C._J._Martin and A._C._Young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process .

      <context> The group known_as the American_Association_for_Health_,_Physical_Education_,_and_Recreation ( a division of the National_Education_Association ) initiated a conference which brought_together representatives of the National_Rifle_Association , SAAMI and the American_Fishing_Tackle_Manufacturers . This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known_as the Outdoor_Education_Project . The Outdoor_Education_Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life . The various <head>team</head> sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education .</context>

      <context> Sixty_five per_cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning . This is substantially higher than the figures for the American population at_large - 45.6 per_cent for males and 29.2 per_cent for females . This may help explain a phenomenon described by a small_town Jewish boy . In their first two years in high_school , Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school <head>teams</head> . However , in their junior and senior years , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement . It is significant , too , that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that Jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts . The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys .</context>

      <context> The structured schools were in an industrial city , with three family tenement_houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes . The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle - to upper-middle_class , but fringed by an industrial area . In_order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods . School_principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research <head>team</head> made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas . An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data . Equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle_class neighborhoods . Individual differences in maturation and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement .</context>
