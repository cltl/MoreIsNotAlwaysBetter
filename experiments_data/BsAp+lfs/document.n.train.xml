      <context> Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances . The occasion for this marathon : Angel 's long awaited reissue in its `` Great_Recordings_of_the_Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro_Arte version . Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . Whether considered alone or in_relation_to other editions , COLH 40 is a <head>document</head> of prime importance . Artur_Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable . But Schnabel was a great teacher in_addition_to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford_Curzon , Frank_Glazer , Adrian_Aeschbacher , and Victor_Babin ) also sheds_light_on the master 's pedagogical skills . Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in_that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) .</context>

      <context> And he refused to be anything else . It is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy_Company and was trained on company ships . He was a Londoner , married , with three sons . ( The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first_name was Hendrik stem from Dutch <head>documents</head> of his third voyage . ) In 1610 , Hudson was probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession . Hudson 's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a_few miles down the Thames . There at the river 's edge waited one Henry_Greene , whom Hudson listed as a `` clerk '' .</context>

      <context> This is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the armed_services , in violation of the provisions of the Universal_Military_Training_and_Service_Act , 62_Stat._604_,_622_,_50_U._S._C._App._462_(_a ) . Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious_objector , contends that he was denied due_process , both in the proceedings before a hearing_officer of the Department_of_Justice and at trial . He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing_officer statements attributed to him by the local board , and , further , that he was denied at trial the right to have the Department_of_Justice hearing_officer 's report and the original report of the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation as to his claim - all in violation of the Fifth_Amendment .

Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months ' imprisonment . The Court_of_Appeals affirmed . 269_F._2_d_613 .</context>

      <context> A goal was fixed , as given in Table 2 , and attention focused_on its fulfillment . The qualifications to vote were kept very simple . Both men and women of twenty-one years of_age could register and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification . There were liberal provisions for dispensation where <head>documents</head> or records were lacking . The police were disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens , criminals and those punished for Protectorate activities . The registration figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit of a reliable census .</context>
