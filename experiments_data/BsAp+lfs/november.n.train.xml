      <context> While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked_out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set_aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87 - 31 . A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29 - 5 . As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action . Pelham pointed_out that Georgia voters last <head>November</head> rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . A veteran Jackson_County legislator will ask the Georgia_House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . Rep._Mac_Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided_that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would_like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' .</context>

      <context> A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city_university , following Anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated Mass before more_than a_hundred . The Protestants themselves are the first to admit the great falling_off in effective membership in their churches . According_to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church_of_England , the `` total of confirmed members is 9748000 , but only 2887671 are registered on the parochial church_rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church_of_England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' . An amazing article in the Manchester_Guardian of last <head>November</head> , entitled `` Fate of Redundant Churches '' , states than an Archbishops ' Commission `` reported last month that in the Church_of_England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years ' time . A further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 '' . And in the last five years , the `` Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels '' . Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman_Catholics '' , and have done so .</context>

      <context> Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928_-_29 '' . However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever . O_'_Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal . On Election_Day - <head>November</head> 4 - he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes . The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates . This further demonstration of O_'_Banion 's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone . In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self_aggrandisement for their liking .</context>

      <context> Until 1924 O_'_Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North_Side domain solidly Democratic . There was a question and answer gag that went_around at that time : Q. `` Who 'll carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards '' ? A. `` O_'_Banion , in his pistol pocket '' . But as <head>November</head> 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O_'_Banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans . To forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O_'_Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay . The reception was held in a private dining_room of the Webster_Hotel on Lincoln_Park_West . It was an interesting fraternisation of ex convicts , union racketeers , ward_heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen .</context>

      <context> The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps . All_of these activities are geared to a top priority communication_system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly . Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence . On <head>November</head> 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka_Peninsula . At 17_:_07 that afternoon ( Greenwich_time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu . The warning system immediately went into action .

      <context> The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves . Whether or not Plato 's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times . Indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian_Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood . One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of <head>November</head> 1 , 1755 ; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far_away as the English coast . Tsunami are rare , however , in the Atlantic_Ocean ; they are far more common in the Pacific . Japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 . The Hawaiian_Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years .</context>

      <context> The part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate , `` It could have been like that for only a_little while '' ; but true memory does not count nor add : it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time . Once , then - for how many years or how few does not matter - my world was bound round by fences , when I was too small to reach the apple_tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull myself up . That world was in scale with my own smallness . I have no picture in my mind of the garden as_a_whole - that I could not see - but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory : wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of <head>November</head> ; ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned_over by a dusty slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown edged holes ; hot colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on_our_way to the pump with the half gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it . It was mother who planted the verbenas . I think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener : she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren .</context>

      <context> Since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections , and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the U.N.F.P. Voting preparations began in the fall of 1959 , although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes was completed in 1958 . There were three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of voters and the registration of candidates . Voter registration began in late <head>November</head> 1959 and continued until early January , 1960 . The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response . Periodic bulletins of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial officials . A goal was fixed , as given in Table 2 , and attention focused_on its fulfillment .</context>

The first known telephone_line in Manchester was established in July 1883 between Burr and Manley 's store at Manchester_Depot and the Kent_and_Root_Marble_Company in South_Dorset . This was extended the following year to include the railroad_station agent 's office and Thayer 's Hotel at Factory_Point . In <head>November</head> 1887 a line connecting several dwelling_houses in Dorset was extended to Manchester_Depot . Telephone_wires from Louis_Dufresne 's house in East_Manchester to the Dufresne lumber job near Bourn_Pond were up about 1895 . Eber_L._Taylor of Manchester_Depot recorded the setting of phone poles in East_Dorset and Barnumville in his diary for 1906 . These must have been for local_calls strictly , as in May 1900 the `` only long distance telephone '' in town was transferred from C._B._Carleton 's to Young 's shoe_store .</context>

      <context> No records are available as_to the date or extent of installation , but it may have been in 1896 . On June_14 , 1900 the Manchester_Journal reported that an electrical_engineer was installing an electric_light plant for Edward_S._Isham at `` Ormsby_Hill '' . This was working by the end of August and giving satisfactory service . In <head>November</head> 1900 surveying was done under John_Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power_plant . Nothing came of it , perhaps due_to lack of opportunity for water storage . The next step was construction by the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company of a plant on the west bank of the Battenkill south of Union_Street bridge . This was nearly completed May 23 , 1901 with a promise of lights by June 10 , but the first light did not go_on until September 28 .</context>
