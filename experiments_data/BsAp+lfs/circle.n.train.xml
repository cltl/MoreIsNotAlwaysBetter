      <context> People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's-eye achievements . The promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it . His answer was simple but honest . He just shot at the board and_then drew <head>circles</head> around the holes to form a bull's-eye . One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2 - year old child is a lack of verbal communication . The child understands no . He senses his mother 's disapproval .</context>

      <context> His history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it . His death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of Jesus . Each man can identify himself with the history and the death of Jesus_Christ because Jesus_Christ has identified himself with human history and human_death , coming as the head of a new humanity . Not a <head>circle</head> , then , nor a straight_line , but a spiral represents the shape of death as Irenaeus sees it ; for a spiral has motion as_well_as recurrence . As represented by a spiral , history may , in_some_sense , be said to repeat itself ; yet each historical event remains unique . Christ is both unique and universal . The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam .</context>

      <context> The death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal . The straight_line would symbolize its uniqueness , the <head>circle</head> its universality . But how can one figure symbolize both ? Christianity declares that in the life and death of Jesus_Christ the unique and the universal concur . Perhaps no church_father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as Irenaeus .</context>

      <context> His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let_alone educate them in a town without even a school . The two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish . Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum . Oldenburg 's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn_to a wider <head>circle</head> of the town 's learned , such_as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching . From the town surveyor , Hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university_student , some academic subjects . The mayor of the town taught them English and French .

      <context> The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members . The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations . There is much talk in theological <head>circles</head> about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation .</context>

      <context> This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement . Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism . I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North . In business <head>circles</head> , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found . But in our case - and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts - the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come_close to wrecking several more . In_fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down . Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up_against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .</context>

From my wife 's experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated <head>circles</head> . The strong feeling is certainly there ; but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South , especially among those who studied in the North . And social_relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting Northerners . Also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems .</context>

This included Mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell_in_love , just as Papa had first fallen_in_love with her Mamma before he chose her ; and when a young_man like Morris_Jastrow had enjoyed the Szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold girls and Mamma .

Rather he weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness .

I hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu <head>circles</head> . This , however , will not exhaust their practical usefulness , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design .

      <context> Of_course it had always been of European origin in_fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural_law theory . Now , with virtually every writer , not_only was the European origin of public_law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others . The European customs on which international_law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states . Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the <head>circle</head> of law governed countries . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states .</context>

      <context> - he had_to play a role of self-effacement . Back_and_forth Duclos had_to go , between M._de_Cury and Jean_Jacques and between the Duke_d'Aumont and Jean_Jacques again , as his little operetta , The_Village_Soothsayer , though still unperformed , took_on ever more importance .

But they , naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at_large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court <head>circles</head> . How titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals . The furor was such_that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational . And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe , Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration , trembling lest his authorship become known , and at_the_same_time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer .</context>
