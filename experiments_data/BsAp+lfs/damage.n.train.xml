      <context> Just before game time , Robinson 's pretty wife , Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer . Unfortunately , Brooks ' teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven hit pitching of three Kansas_City rookie hurlers . Hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with Lee_MacPhail ; J._A._W._Iglehart , chairman of the Oriole board_of_directors , and Public_Relations_Director Jack_Dunn . Their flight was delayed , Dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor <head>damage</head> to the wing of the plane . Ex Oriole Clint_Courtney , now catching for the A 's is all for the American_League 's 1961 expansion to the West_Coast . `` But they shouldda brought_in Tokyo , too '' , added Old_Scrapiron . `` Then we 'd really have someplace to go '' .</context>

Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland . `` He 's looking a_lot better , and he 's able to run '' , Meek explained . `` We 'll let him do a_lot of running this week , but I do n't know if he 'll be able to play '' .</context>

      <context> `` In_fact our whole defensive unit did a good job '' . The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton_Davidson throwing only 17 passes . `` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack '' , explained Stram . `` They can be going_along , doing little <head>damage</head> , then bang , bang - they can hit a_couple_of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in_trouble '' . The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final_period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off . The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner_Haynes , the flashy halfback . He was called_upon 26 times - more than all_of the other ball carriers combined - and delivered 145 yards .</context>

      <context> Teaching guides are included with each record . In an effort to fortify himself against the unforeseen upsets sure to arise in the future , Herbert_A._Leggett , banker editor of the Phoenix `` Arizona_Progress '' , reflects upon a_few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties . One of the roughest was the TV quiz shows , which gave him inferiority_complexes . Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned_out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable <head>damage</head> to the ego of the editor and many_another intelligent , well-informed American . But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $ 2000000 profit on the stock_market . Every man who dabbles_in the market to make a_little easy_money on_the_side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb . Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best_seller book to make some dough .</context>

      <context> Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go_to Red_River where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest_Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire . The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward . When late in the summer the full extent of the <head>damage</head> was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river . Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort_Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland . The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort_Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food . The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders .</context>

      <context> While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came_in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military_services and the police that the first big wave would arrive_at Honolulu at 23_:_30 Greenwich_time . It turned_out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 . They hurled a cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu_Harbor , knocked_down telephone_lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows . But not a single human life was lost , and property <head>damage</head> in the Hawaiian_Islands did not exceed $ 800000 . There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage . But it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough . In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts , or at_least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves .</context>

      <context> In place of the police_headquarters was a new square filled with rubble . Mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next_door . What had been the ambassador 's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick . This <head>damage</head> had been done in the battle of Vientiane , fought less_than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( December 9 - 11 , 1960 ) . And now , in March , all Laos suffered a state of siege . The Pathet_Lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more . Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death .</context>

      <context> Biological_warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man . It is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious_disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons_systems . Man may also be injured secondarily by <head>damage</head> to his food crops or domestic_animals . Biological_warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon . The major reason for this is that it has no quick kill effect . The incubation_period of infectious_disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter .</context>

      <context> The injured German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head . This resulted in <head>damage</head> to the occipital_lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . In_any_event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` psychically blind '' , while at_the_same_time , apparently , the sense_of_touch remained essentially intact . Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for_example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure_up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . This circumstance in the patient 's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at_hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that_is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever .</context>

      <context> ( 1 ) When an object was placed in the patient 's hand , he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it was made of wood , iron , cloth , rubber , and_so_on . And he could recognize , by touch alone , articles which he had handled immediately before , even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him ; that_is , he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was . ( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade . Because of his brain injury and the extreme <head>damage</head> suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line_of_work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation requiring a great_deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour . It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more_than the foregoing facts [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , - that_is , from one end to the other - was unimpaired '' . If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense_of_touch can be explained by his defective visual condition .</context>

      <context> While the factories were always the center of the labor_market , they were often on the city 's periphery . In spreading the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities . Even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt 's motel has been relatively painless ; the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every_year . What hurts most is the <head>damage</head> the automobile has done to central-city retailing , especially in those cities where public_transit is feeble . Some retailing , of_course , always spreads with the population - grocery_stores , drugstores , local haberdasheries and dress_shops , candy_stores and the_like . But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago - a new bedroom_set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior - the family set_off for the downtown department_store , where the selection would be greatest . Department_stores congregated in the `` one_hundred per_cent location '' , where all the transit_lines converged .</context>
