      <context> A group of researchers at the University_of_Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques . One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched . A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed . Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood_vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic <head>energy</head> . The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes about 16 | msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue . A sonar or radar type of pulse_generator and time-delay_measuring_system is required for body tissue evaluation . In_addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique .</context>

      <context> A refinement of this technique has been described by Drs._Zworykin and Farrar and Mr._Berkely of the Medical_Electronics_Center of the Rockefeller_Institute . In this novel arrangement the `` pill '' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in_which the capacitor is formed by a pressure sensing transducer . As shown in Fig. 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400 - kc. bursts . The <head>energy</head> received by the `` pill '' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ringing '' takes_place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' . These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained . One of the advantages of_this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions . Applications to organs other_than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments .</context>

      <context> But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather_than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location . Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness . Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists_of minute waves of <head>energy</head> . We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound_waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite . So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states_of_matter , successive one_after_another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies . This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .</context>

      <context> No amount of ballyhoo will cover_up the sordid facts . If we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it . First , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per_se cannot take economic leadership . Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , <head>energies</head> and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind . When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism . The biggest loss , of_course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy . Socialism , I grant , has a definite place in our society .</context>

      <context> Similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat_of_formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride . The development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion . In one of these , an exploding wire device to study systems thermodynamically up_to 6000 * * f and 100 atmospheres pressure , a major goal was achieved . The accuracy of measuring the total electrical <head>energy</head> entering an exploding wire during a_few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat_energy produced had an uncertainty of less_than 2 percent . This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals . The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter . The element is inserted in the discharge circuit in_place_of the exploding wire , and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy .</context>

      <context> The opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil . During the discharge the magnetic_forces set_up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center_line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera . Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60 - 80 microseconds . The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical <head>energy</head> input to the foil . Besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength , the spectra of extraterrestrial radio_sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small molecules . The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres . Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH ; somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH , SiH , and ScH .</context>

The thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of **f . This temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as_far_as radiation is concerned . It is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder , to make the <head>energy</head> flux radiated from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements . The reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the specular characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry . The total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts .

      <context> The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation . The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode . In free_burning electric arcs , for_instance , approximately 90 % of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving_rise to local heat fluxes in excess of **f as measured by the authors - the exact value depending_on the arc atmosphere . In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high_temperature research tools often more than 50 % of the total <head>energy</head> input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode .

      <context> This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' . There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed_out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar . If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar . The concept of the strain <head>energy</head> as a Gibbs function difference * * f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear . Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45 ` to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear . According_to Philippoff , the recoverable shear s is given by * * f where |c is the angle_of_extinction .

It gives him aid , comfort , even solace , in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate . He is confronted with the recurrent crises , such_as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life - marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old_age , the certainty of death .</context>

      <context> Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state . The belief in immortality , where held , functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here_and_now . The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance . The feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as_well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving_vent to emotions and <head>energies</head> . In providing for these inner individual functions , religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace_of_mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution . In_addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society . The two have never been separable .</context>

      <context> The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools . According_to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit . The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released <head>energy</head> toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem . Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced . The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination . But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple .</context>

      <context> It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you '' ? She clearly agreed that this had been the case . I realized , now , that she had been showing me , in what impressed me as being a very accurate way , something her mother had once said to her ; it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her . What had been an unmanageably powerful introject was now , despite its continuing charge of <head>energy</head> disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like . Earlier , this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at_times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice . A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used_to often seclude herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door - as I would find on passing_by , between our sessions - for_all_the_world like two persons , a scolding mother and a defensive child . Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome .</context>

      <context> Scotty was neutral . He did not resent their supervision or Virginia 's sometimes tiring sympathy . He ate what he felt_like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the draughty rooms of the house , when he was not in bed , with slow dubious steps , like an elderly tourist in a cathedral . His <head>energy</head> was gone . He was able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living_room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving . His hands lay loosely , yet stiffly - they were like wax hands : almost lifelike , not quite - folded in his lap ; his mouth hung slightly open . When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable , he would answer ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a_little louder .</context>

It required an <head>energy</head> he no_longer possessed to be satirical about his father . His father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look_at his son .

Scotty would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat .</context>

      <context> He respected each of these approach techniques , and kept them in character : his quill drawings had a scratchiness , suggesting skin texture ; the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an abdomen , in a reclining torso ; the wax he smoothed_over to give the body surface an elastic pull . Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; they remained rough starting_points . When carving he was charged with spontaneous <head>energy</head> ; too_careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model .

      <context> Our suspicions eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a grocer 's boy , a thoroughly bad_hat , who delivered cartons to the people overhead . The more I probed into this young_man 's activities and character , the less savory I found him . I learned , for_example , that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet . His <head>energy</head> was prodigious ; sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage_collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx_Zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar_butts against their paws . Evenings , he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like Enrico + Paglieri's or Peter's_Backyard drunkenly donning ladies ' hats and singing `` O_Sole_Mio '' . In_short , and to borrow an arboreal phrase , slash_timber . Well , the odious little toad went_along chivying animals and humans who could n't retaliate , and in_due_course , as was inevitable , overreached himself .</context>
