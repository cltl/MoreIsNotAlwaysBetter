      <context> At this date , it seems probable that the name of Serge_Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History , as an effective Traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ; yet was never caught_up in it - never a slave to its academic dialectics . Certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World - not his experimentations . So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them . Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different <head>circumstances</head> . His fellow countryman , Igor Stravinsky , certainly did not . Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity , while Stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness ? I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff 's own words :</context>

      <context> Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate . Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; a middle_distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this <head>circumstance</head> accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia . It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment . His pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale ; they universalize in_terms_of weather , skies , earth , and people .</context>

      <context> We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry - at both the manufacturing and retail ends . Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts . The change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention - practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted . Have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing <head>circumstances</head> ? In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under_way during the first decade . As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share_in the manufacturer 's as_well as the distributor 's profits - which is , in_effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do . Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded .</context>

      <context> Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not_yet been tested on an adequate number of patients . The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable . It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep wakefulness cycle . A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special <head>circumstances</head> , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting . In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such_as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs . The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated . Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies_in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity .</context>

      <context> The psychological incompatibility of these emotional_states seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference . In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems , respectively . We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic somatic downward discharge as_well_as regarding the hypothalamic cortical discharge . Although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first approximation , it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic cortical discharges account_for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological <head>circumstances</head> , in experimental and clinical neurosis , and as the result of psychopharmacological agents . In_view_of the important role which emotional_disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes .</context>

      <context> All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable <head>circumstances</head> . A third aspect , and probably the one open_to most controversy , is the results of the election .

      <context> For internal political reasons , the union asks for ( and accepts ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up_to the discretion of the companies of the industry . Changes in the basic wage rate are cost raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices . However , it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude . In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in <head>circumstances</head> to be spelled_out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise . Thus , for non negative changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active wage_setter , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence . The presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case , on the grounds that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously . From this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be_due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model .</context>

      <context> For such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs ( due_to rising wages , etc . ) . Thus , if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate . In this model , we abstract from all non wage sources of cost changes , so that the `` public limit price '' only rises as the wage rate rises . In such <head>circumstances</head> , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate . Since marginal_costs rise when the wage rate rises , the profit_maximizing price also rises when the public limit price is elevated , and is likely to remain well above the latter . The entry limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic competition , but unless general inflation permits profit_margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy , we might expect the public limit price to approach the entry limit price . The foreign entry limit price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage rates do not enter foreign costs directly .</context>

The necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense_of_touch , as_such . We do not arrive_at spatial images by means of the sense_of_touch by itself . ( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual_sensation only by way of visual representations ; that_is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual_space '' .</context>

      <context> Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' . In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical . J._Wheaton_Smith , editor of the Warren_Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in_order_that all those misnamed philantropists [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' . The editor of the Newport_Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating <head>circumstances</head> in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment . In direct_contrast to the other Rhode_Island editors , Samuel_S._Foss of the Woonsocket_Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair . Concerning the sentence , Foss wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John_Brown 's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment , it would be well - well for the country and for Virginia '' . Despite the excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of John_Brown , Rhode_Islanders turned their attention to the state elections .</context>

Some liar 's logic , a wisp of optimism as fragile as the scent of tropical blossoms that came_through the window ( a euphoria perhaps engendered by the pill Fritzie had given her ) , consoled her for a moment . Amy had_to be safe , had_to come_back to them - if only to reap that share of life 's experiences that were her due , if only to give her parents another chance to do better by her . Through the swathings of terror , she jabbed deceit 's sharp point - Amy would be reborn , a new child , with new parents , living under new <head>circumstances</head> . The comfort was short-lived , yet she found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion .
