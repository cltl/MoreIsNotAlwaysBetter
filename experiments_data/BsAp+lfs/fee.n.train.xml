      <context> The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' . Nevertheless , `` we feel that in_the_future Fulton_County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said . `` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers . The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary 's court which has been under_fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of <head>fees</head> and compensation . The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating_procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand_juries , the Atlanta_Bar_Association and an interim citizens_committee . `` These actions should serve to protect in_fact and in_effect the court 's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . Regarding Atlanta 's new million dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes_charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' .</context>

      <context> Would early retirement of non-productive , disabled employees reduce the number of make-work jobs ?

Can your plant nurse be replaced by a trained first-aid man who works full-time on some_other assignment ? Do you rigidly distinguish between job - and non job connected health_problems and avoid treating the latter ?

      <context> On_the_other_hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; no client would ever think_of asking him to do such things . Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private_eye ends_up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder . Operating as a one_man police_force in fact if not in_name , he is at_once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves . He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a <head>fee</head> at_all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished . Thus the fictional detective is much more_than a simple businessman . He is , first_and_foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society . It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts_for the great appeal of the mythological detective .</context>
