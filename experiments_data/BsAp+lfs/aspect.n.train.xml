      <context> That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' . One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite . Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy . The London_Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping_out various <head>aspects</head> of Catholic progress during the last one_hundred years . With traditional nationalistic spirit , some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best . I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics . It has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses at Mass .</context>

These two <head>aspects</head> of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified . The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated . Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and_then older and_then still older , in_short , whether Adam 's life was intended to be part of the process of time .

      <context> The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural_order of time and change . On_the_other_hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence . It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law . If this <head>aspect</head> of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator . This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced . If death receives more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through Christ begins to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence . Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history .</context>

But contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor 's chisel - is something quite different . This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him .</context>

I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr._Jameson_Campaigne has done it well in his new book American_Might_and_Soviet_Myth .

The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air .

      <context> All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . In Plato 's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers . Presupposed in Plato 's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom . Aristotle also tended to stratify all <head>aspects</head> of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato . But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths . For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in_contrast_to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality .</context>

So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard_to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation 's needs for survival . The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society .

      <context> Its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the English_professor with whom one attends the theatre . The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of English_professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor_cars , political candidates , or female beauty . Along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than I have seen . In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this <head>aspect</head> of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon_Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human_beings and events . But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap . I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth .

      <context> I do not know that this is true ; both Flugel and Ranyard_West deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologians as Niebuhr and Buber . It forms the core of many , perhaps most , problems of psychotherapy . I am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary_study in the development of conscience - most_of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life , or , for the theologians of_course , to the influence of religion . Still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one 's ideas of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic_books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral <head>aspects</head> of_this influence . Probably the most important thing to focus_on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available . This is in large part a code_of_behavior and a glossary of values : what is it that people do and should do and_how one should regard it . In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint .</context>

The unifying effect of religion is also brought_out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more_or_less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized .

While high anxiety children achieve significantly less well ( * * f ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children , they appear to do at_least as well as the average in the structured classroom . The most striking <head>aspect</head> of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools . According_to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit . The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem .</context>

The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken_up later . In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every <head>aspect</head> of school progress , and the children 's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years .

      <context> Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed countries . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from <head>aspects</head> of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality .</context>

      <context> The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality . It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action . To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other <head>aspects</head> of nineteenth century philosophy . First , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity . National identification was not new , but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new unifications occurred . It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will '' put_forward by the Germans , especially by Hegel , although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of Hobbes .</context>

      <context> Often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly , without the tracing motions , solely on the basis of qualitative differences among the blot like things which appeared in his visual experience . Perhaps the very important question - What is , then , exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the patient 's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things ? - has now been raised in the reader 's mind and in the following form . If the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense_of_touch has immediate contact with the spatial <head>aspects</head> of things in_independence_of visual representations , at_least in regard_to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on_the_part_of unaided touch is denied by the authors . How , then , do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this ? The authors set_about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient 's ability , tactually , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate objects in space , with his eyes closed ( or turned_away from the object concerned ) . Quite naturally , they make the investigation , first , by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at_all and_then , later , by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to .</context>

      <context> The pottery of the first_half of the eighth century is commonly called Ripe_Geometric . The severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years , the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying Geometric pottery ; but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance . The vases which resulted had different shapes , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style . Beyond the aesthetic and technical <head>aspects</head> of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines . In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos . They had had_to work_on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses . The potters , in_particular , had virtually eschewed freehand drawing , elaborate motifs , and the curving lines of nature , while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe .</context>

      <context> In the vases this spirit may perhaps at_times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world . The ninth century was in its artistic work `` the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future '' , and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated . Geometric pottery has not_yet received the thorough , detailed study which it deserves , partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations , as at Argos , are only now coming_to_light . From even a cursory inspection of its many <head>aspects</head> , however , the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B.C. The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree . Much which was in_embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 . In this process the Minoan Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected ; the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800 .</context>

      <context> On these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the Iliad .

Further we cannot go , for the Dark_ages deserve their name . Many <head>aspects</head> of civilization were not_yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure . The epic_poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the rise of firm political_units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men - all these had to await the progress of following decades . What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search . These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces .</context>

      <context> Out of_this re-created literalness , the Cubist subject reemerged . For it had turned_out , by a further paradox of Cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging . In the Analytical phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not_only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in_order to preserve it ; they had also had to generalize it - to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as_such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself . In_order to be saved , plasticity had had to be isolated ; and as the <head>aspect</head> of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more_or_less interchangeable and contour obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method , the subject itself became largely unrecognizable . Cubism , in its 1911 - 1912 phase ( which the_French , with justice , call `` hermetic '' ) was on the verge of abstract_art . It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation . If they opted_for illusion , it could only be illusion per_se - an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual objects .</context>
