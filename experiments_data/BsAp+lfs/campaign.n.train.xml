      <context> When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system - a system which the party opposes in its platform . Sam_Caldwell , State_Highway_Department public_relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd 's <head>campaign</head> . Caldwell 's resignation had been expected for some time . He will be succeeded by Rob_Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years .

      <context> The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno_Bertoia beat_out a high chopper to third_base and scored on Lenny_Green 's double to left .

Jim_Landis ' 380 - foot home_run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1 - 0 lead , but Harmon_Killebrew came_back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob_Allison aboard . Al_Smith 's 340 - blast over left in the fourth - his fourth homer of the <head>campaign</head> - tied the score and Carreon 's first major_league home_run in the fifth put the Sox back in_front . A double by Green , Allison 's run scoring 2_baser , an infield single by Lemon and Gardner 's solid single to center put the Twins back in_front in the last of the fifth . Boston_Red_Sox Outfielder Jackie_Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball . `` I 've had it '' , he told a newsman .</context>

      <context> In spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions . To the manufacturer of the more convenient type product - the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put_off entirely - the implications are important . Your competition is now proportionately greater - you are competing not_only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products . Many industry trade associations are developing <head>campaigns</head> to protect or enhance the share of the consumer 's dollar being spent on their particular products . Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying '' area ? The trends have been in_evidence for many years - population_shifts to the Southwest and Far_West , and from city to suburbs . These shifts will continue in the next 10 yr. .</context>

      <context> The Outdoor_Education_Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life . The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous <head>campaign</head> of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach .</context>

      <context> In 1920 , the Lambeth_Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together_with the grave dangers - physical , moral , and religious - thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' . Denouncing the view that the sexual_union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded_as the governing considerations of Christian marriage . One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . The Conference called_for a vigorous <head>campaign</head> against the open or secret sale of contraceptives . In 1930 , the Lambeth_Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate . In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth_control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere . Many other Protestant_denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action .</context>

      <context> No group of officers came_in_for more spirited denunciation than the doctors . One Federal_soldier wrote : `` The docters is no_a_conte . hell will be filde with do_[_c_]_ters and offersey when this war is over '' . Shortly after the beginning of Sherman 's Georgia <head>campaign</head> , an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk : `` The surgeon insisted on Sending me to the hospital for treatment . I insisted on takeing_the_field and prevailed - thinking that I had_better die by rebel bullets than [ by ] Union quackery '' . The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward each other were very_much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred . The Rebs were , to a Massachusetts corporal , `` fighting madmen or not men at_all but whiskey + gunpowder put into a human frame '' .</context>

      <context> Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep_abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength . If we look_at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev 's nightmarish worries - or , at_least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage . The other charge was that America 's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years . The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the <head>campaign</head> , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world_affairs can quarrel with it . The argument was typically advanced in_terms_of U._S. `` prestige '' . Prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ; and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading . Prestige is a measure of how other people think_of you , well or ill .</context>

But contrary to what was implied during the <head>campaign</head> , prestige is surely not important for its own sake . Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be . The thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it . The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United_States is weaker than the Soviet_Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead .</context>

      <context> Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him . Each is still glorified as a national hero .

After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated <head>campaign</head> the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .

      <context> When some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for_instance , we do not turn_to free and open discussion as in a political_campaign .

Our presidential <head>campaigns</head> provide much debate and argument .

Man , we are told , is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad .
