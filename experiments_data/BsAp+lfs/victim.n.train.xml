      <context> Dolores_Hart , is charming in a leading role , and quite believable . I was delighted with Paula_Prentiss ' comedy performance , which was as fresh and unstilted as one 's highest hopes might ask . A_couple_of the males made good comedy , too - Jim_Hutton and Frank_Gorshin . The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette_Mimieux , but since someone had to become the <head>victim</head> of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , I suppose this was the attitude the part called_for . I must say , however , that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it . To anyone who remembers Newport at its less_than maximum violence , this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz_Festival ought to prove entertaining . The second feature , `` The_Price_of_Silence '' , is a British detective_story that will talk_your_head_off .</context>

      <context> If deja_vu is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental_disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people . Chauncey_Depew , one-time runner-up for the Republican Presidential nomination , was attending a convention at Saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel_Theodore_Roosevelt for Governor of New_York when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met . After the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt . If Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a <head>victim</head> of deja_vu . But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene . He remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had . One week before the convention , Depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson , gazing at the opposite shore .</context>

      <context> His plunder is therefore far higher - running into hundreds of millions . According_to the Food_and_Drug_Administration ( FDA ) , `` Doctor '' Ghadiali , Dr._Albert_Abrams and his clique , and Dr._Wilhelm_Reich - to name three notorious device quacks - succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines . Authorities believe that many_of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business . Look_at the sums paid by two device quack <head>victims</head> in Cleveland . Sarah_Gross , a dress_shop proprietor , paid $ 1020 to a masseur , and Mr._A. , a laborer , paid $ 4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines - the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' . Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually . You will come_up with a frightening total .</context>

      <context> ( Small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $ 35823 for his wife 's death . ) In California , a_few years ago , a ghoul by the name of H._F._Bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer . He did this by the charming practice of buying_up used electric blankets for $ 5 to $ 10 from survivors of patients who had died , reconditioning them , and selling them at $ 185 each . When authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license ( he got_off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his <head>victims</head> was not around to testify : He was dead of cancer . By_no_means are these isolated cases . `` Unfortunately '' , says Chief_Postal_Inspector_David_H._Stephens , who has prosecuted many device quacks , `` the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called_up in court '' .

      <context> Have no_doubt about it . That 's where device quackery can lead . The evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths of thousands . Who are the <head>victims</head> of the device quacks ? Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target . Says Wallace_F._Jannsen , director of the FDA 's Division_of_Public_Information : `` Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferers from chronic ailments such_as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer . People who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken_in by quacks '' .</context>

      <context> One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had_to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas_chambers . The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten - the gas_chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star_of_David - nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . Public_relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried_out : Too_much , too_much - the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had_to tell how the <head>victims</head> had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most_of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing_on the corpus_delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject_to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs . Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection . Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought_on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ?</context>

      <context> This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief . Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil_law is concerned with public crimes . Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil_authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin . Among the chief <head>victims</head> of such an ill_conceived imposition would be religion itself .</context>

      <context> He could learn at second_hand from books , but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit . Harris_J._Griston , in Shaking_The_Dust_From_Shakespeare ( 216 ) , writes : `` There is not a word spoken by Shylock which one would expect from a real Jew '' . He took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone . The Jew was the safest <head>victim</head> . No Jew was on_hand to boycott his financially struggling theater . It would have been unwise policy , for_instance , to apply the pound of flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman . Just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of Mars , or even of Tikopia , and no senatorial investigation will result .</context>

      <context> Some members of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives . Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo_bumblebee '' as it is called in some European_countries . Female individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize . The one sure way to tell <head>victim</head> and villain apart is to examine the hind_legs which in the case of the idler , Psithyrus , lack the pollen baskets - naturally ! The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host . When she succeeds , she usually manages to slip_in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment . The hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally .</context>

      <context> It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him . For that legend was growing explosively , Rumor was insisting he received a price of $ 600 a man . ( The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $ 125 , very good money in an era when top hands worked for $ 30 and found . ) Rumor had_it he slipped two small rocks under each <head>victim</head> 's head as a sort of trademark . ( A detailed search of old coroner 's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest . ) One thing was certain - his method was effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary . The mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field_glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the Upper_Laramie country in a single week .</context>
