      <context> The gas flamed_up two inches high . They found the teakettle and put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox . Several sections of a loaf of dark_bread ; butter ; jam ; a tiny cake of ice . In their search for what turned_out to be the right breakfast <head>china</head> but the wrong table silver , they opened every cupboard door in the kitchen and pantry . While she was settling the teacart , he went_back across the hall to their bedroom , opened one of the suitcases , and took_out powdered coffee and sugar . She appeared with the teacart and he opened the windows . `` Do you want to call Eugene '' ?</context>

      <context> Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in_order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village . At_the_same_time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out_of mere curiosity . No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived . When he had given the call a_few moments thought , he went_into the kitchen to ask Mrs._Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English <head>china</head> and the silver tea_service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds . Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn . Rector asked him to move it for_the_time_being ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless . A good initial impression would be important now .</context>

      <context> He was marching up_and_down the locker_room of the Grassy_Brae_Golf_Club shouting , `` Bomb Cuba ! Bomb Berlin ! Let 's throw a_little nuclear hardware at them and show them who 's boss '' . He was brigadier of the club 's locker-room light infantry , and at one time or another declared war on Russia , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , and <head>China</head> . It all began on an autumn afternoon - and who , after all these centuries , can describe the fineness of an autumn day ? One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it . The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year 's lights .</context>

      <context> Then he looked at his finger , at the wrinkled , heavy knuckle and the thick nail he used like a knife to pry up , slit , and open . For_the_first_time , he let himself be sad about the move . That house was ten years off his life . Each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward , and he knew how to get_at the dust in the <head>china</head> flowers and how to take_down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier . He knew the house like a blind_man , through his fingers , and he did not like to think_of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up . Ten years ago , he had come to the house to be interviewed . The tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive , and he had walked up from the bus almost singing .</context>

      <context> It hung_in all her day clothes , sweet and strong ; sometimes when he was pressing , Winston raised her dresses to his face . Frowning , Miss_Ada studied the list . `` Well , let 's see . The <head>china</head> lemon_tree . The alabaster cockatoo '' . Winston followed her around the room , collecting the small frail objects ( Christmas , birthday , and anniversary ) and wrapping them in tissue_paper . Neither of them trusted the movers .</context>

      <context> He evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks , and quickly superseded his boss . Not long_ago , I rode down with him in an elevator in Radio_City ; he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at_once , clearly a man in_extremis . `` See that guy '' ? the operator asked pityingly . `` I would n't be_in_his_shoes for all the rice in <head>China</head> . There 's some kind_of a nemesis haunting his footsteps '' . However one looks_at it , therefore , I 'd say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy . The inventory you acquired from me is n't going_to be easy to move ; you can't very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva .</context>

      <context> Above_all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence , to whimper over the loss of a_few objets_d'art , or to shame you into rectitude . My object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict . You have unwittingly set_in_motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . Quite candidly , fellows , I would n't be_in_your_shoes for all the rice in <head>China</head> . As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly . Sometime on Saturday evening , August 22nd , while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria_dell_'Orso , in Rome , you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks_County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . Hastening to the attic , the temperature of_which was easily hotter than the Gold_Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the_like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there .</context>
