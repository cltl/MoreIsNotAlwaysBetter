      <context> The most beautiful <head>bed</head> of pansies I 've seen was in a South_Dakota yard on a sizzling day . Pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun . I sought_out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather . He seemed puzzled by my question .</context>

      <context> And this helps explain why so many people are now going camping . It 's fun , and it 's easy - so easy that there is time left after cooking , and tent keeping , for the women to get_out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families . Camp meals are no great problem . Neither are <head>beds</head> , thanks to air_mattresses and sleeping_bags . Neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper . But there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs .</context>

      <context> `` Because that 's no activity for a gentleman '' . But such cases were , in the past , unusual . Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male - even the Bible appears to endorse the concept . Family survival on our own Western frontier , for_example , could quite literally depend_on a man 's strength and ability to bring_home_the_bacon ; and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage <head>bed</head> . This carried_over into the more urbanized late 19 th and early 20 th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull_roaring Life_With_Father manner . In those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere . `` Grandma was n't expected to like it '' , Dr._Marion_Hilliard , the late Toronto gynecologist , once summed_up the attitude of the ' 90 s .</context>

      <context> But her personality was such_that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity . Then the wife bed_hopped to the next on the list . In some cases , however , domination of the sex_act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need . Thus a man who is butting_a_stone_wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in <head>bed</head> - the one place he can still be champion . If his on-the-job problems work_out , he may return to his old pattern . Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep_over a man - or his wife - because he or she feels age creeping_up . On_the_other_hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive - asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .</context>

      <context> It is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics - not the husband . The whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs . Beyond a certain point , of_course , no woman can be dominant - nature has seen to that . But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital <head>bed</head> . Of_course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy . Yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly . The meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother 's or grandmother 's standards .</context>
