      <context> Oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war . First the Larkins are ahead , then the Jerebohms . After Larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants , he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers . One of the local callers , a retired brigadier apparently left_over from Kipling 's tales of <head>India</head> , does not approve of the way Larkin gets his birds . He does n't think that potting them from a deck_chair on the south_side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting . But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish . It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel_de_Cervantes ' `` Don_Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide_screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth_Street and Sixty-eighth_Street_Playhouses .</context>

      <context> Land_reform programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture . Lastly , governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead . By holding_out prospects for external capital assistance , the United_States can provide strong incentives to prepare_for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth . At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as <head>India</head> , Brazil , the Philippines , and Taiwan , which are ready and committed to move_into the stage of self-sustaining growth . They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups . But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies . On the economic front , the first priority of these countries is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources .</context>

      <context> `` I volunteer '' , said Hal . `` Tell me more , Sandalphon '' . Six months later , Hal_Yarrow stood in the observation_dome of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth dwindle above him . It was night on this hemisphere , but the light blazed from the megalopolises of Australia , Japan , China , Southeast_Asia , <head>India</head> , Siberia . Hal , the linguist , saw the glittering discs and necklaces in_terms_of the languages spoken therein . Australia , the Philippine_Islands , Japan , and northern China were inhabited by those members of the Haijac_Union that spoke American . Southern_China , all_of southeast Asia , southern India and Ceylon , these states of the Malay_Federation spoke Bazaar .</context>

In southern Europe , between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic_speaking peoples of northern Europe , was a thin but long stretch of territory called March . This was no_man's_land , disputed by the Haijac_Union and the Israeli_Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years . Neither nation would give_up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic_War .</context>
