      <context> But contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor 's chisel - is something quite different . This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him . Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others . Because they are `` minority '' exercises and have but a limited <head>appeal</head> they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten . Only when the newest Mr._America or Mr._Universe rediscovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once_again see how effective they really are . The exercise I shall discuss in this - the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition specialization of a particular body_part - is the One_Leg_Lunge . Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no_matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths !</context>

      <context> To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications . Dominated_by the vicious_circle of the university promotion_system , the analyst looks_down_on and gets_along poorly with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector . The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a_few energetic amateurs and collectors . The work done by the analysts , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no_more <head>appeal</head> than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience . Publishers want books that will sell , recording_studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used_to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high_schools want quaint , but moral , material . The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit_in . As a result , most people do n't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is ; they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legends and patriotic anecdotes , with a superstition or remedy thrown_in here_and_there .</context>

      <context> The guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors . As he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga . Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory . Excellent in their way , they lack the wide <head>appeal</head> of The_Charles_Men , and need not detain us here . It is different with his volume The_Swedes_and_Their_Chieftains ( Svenskarna_och_deras_ho ^_vdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high_school students . Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries .

      <context> He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at_all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished . Thus the fictional detective is much more_than a simple businessman . He is , first_and_foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society . It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts_for the great <head>appeal</head> of the mythological detective . By_virtue_of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private_eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle_class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let_the_devil_take_the_hindmost . At_the_same_time , because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle_class eyes a virtuous man . In this way , the private_detective gets the best of two possible worlds .</context>

      <context> However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including du_Pont 's competitors '' , 353_U._S._,_at_607 , outweighed the Government 's claim for relief . This claim , as submitted to the District_Court and dismissed by it , 126_F._Supp .235 , alleged violation not_only of 7 of the Clayton_Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman_Act . The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's <head>appeal</head> from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation .</context>

      <context> We found in Gonzales_v._United_States , supra , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant .

      <context> While the regulations formerly required that the hearing_officer 's report be placed in the registrant 's file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952 . Moreover , the hearing_officer 's report is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney_General and , of_course , is not the recommendation of the Department . It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department_of_Justice , of which the Attorney_General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection . It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes_into the making of the final recommendation to the <head>appeal</head> board . It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing_officer 's notes were furnished to the appeal board . Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board .

      <context> Until the Charter_of_Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes . The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 , but the P.D.I. ( Parti_Democratique_de_l'Independance ) , the most important minor party at the time , objected to the Istiqlal 's predominance in the civil_service and influence in Radio_Maroc . There were rumors that the Ministry_of_the_Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings . The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing <head>appeals</head> concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be supported by the King himself . The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called_in and notices of further investigation appeared from_time_to_time . In January , 1958 , the Minister_of_the_Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied .</context>

      <context> If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children 's clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too_much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount_business in big-ticket items . Department_stores were built_on dry_goods , especially ladies ' fashions , and in this area , in_the_long_run , the suburban branches will be hard_put to compete against downtown . If this analysis is correct , the suburban branches will turn_out to be what management 's cost_accountants refuse to acknowledge , marginal operations rather_than major factors . Historically in America the <head>appeal</head> of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered . `` How ya gonna keep ' em down on the farm '' ? was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree .

      <context> Less ambitious freeway plans may be more successful - especially when the roadways and interchanges are raised , allowing_for cross access at many points and providing parking_areas below the ramp . Meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central_city some of its industrial dominance . In ever greater numbers , factories are locating in the suburbs or in `` industrial_parks '' removed from the city 's political jurisdiction . The <head>appeal</head> of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly_line and wants enough land_area to do the entire job on one floor . To light industry , the economies of being on one floor are much slighter , but efficiency_engineers usually believe_in them , and manufacturers looking_for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning_to efficiency_engineers . This movement of industry away from the central_cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe . It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities .</context>

And_then the Amen_corner took_hold , re-enacting a form of group_participation in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek_chorus , spreading down through the African forest , overseas to the West_Indies , and then here in Alabama .
