      <context> By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today 's artists , the program turned_out to be a not quite perfect example of either . Still , the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated . Even Joan_Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan_Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti 's `` Lucia_di_Lammermoor '' Sunday night . The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing_ovation as Miss_Sutherland took curtain_call after curtain_call following a fantastic `` Mad_Scene '' created on_her_own and with the <head>help</head> of the composer and the other performers . Her entrance in Scene_2_,_Act_1 , brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note . Thereafter the audience waxed applause happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization . As she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` Lucia '' .</context>

      <context> Through the efforts of SAAMI 's shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a_few . The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many_of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it . <head>Help</head> is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level . The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association . Since SAAMI 's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone_into the development of more places to_shoot for more youths and adults . We trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment .</context>

Upon arriving_at Baltimore , Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John_Quincy_Adams , Secretary_of_State at Washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois_Territories '' . This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at_first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements '' .</context>

Mercer 's Whiteman association brought him into contact with Hoagy_Carmichael , whose `` Snowball '' Mercer relyriced as `` Lazybones '' , in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning of Mercer 's song writing career . After leaving Whiteman , Mercer joined the Benny_Goodman band as a vocalist . With the <head>help</head> of Ziggy_Elman , also in the band , he transformed a traditional Jewish melody into a popular song , `` And_the_Angels_Sing '' . The countrywide success of `` Lazybones '' and `` And_the_Angels_Sing '' could only lead to Hollywood , where , besides Harold_Arlen , Mercer collaborated with Harry_Warren , Jimmy_Van_Heusen , Richard_Whiting , Walter_Donaldson , Jerome_Kern , and Arthur_Schwartz . Mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs . He may be the only song_writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the U._S._Treasury ; he collaborated on a song with William_Hartman_Woodin , who was Secretary of the Treasury , 1932 - 33 .</context>
