      <context> Today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world . The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point . It is brought to packing_houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior . The fruit is then cooled to 42 ` F. , a <head>temperature</head> at which it lapses into a sort_of dormant state . This cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grove like temperature ( room_temperature ) is restored . This happens on the grocer 's shelf or in your kitchen . One of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind .</context>

      <context> The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form . There , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism . But in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to_it . One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in <head>temperature</head> , just as electrical bodies do . It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb . By that , one feels that magnetic_forces are as general as electrical forces .

In the observations at 4.3 mm ( Coates , 1959 a ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , 6 ' .7 , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface , and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases . These observations indicate that the lunar maria heat_up more rapidly and also cool_off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions . Mare_Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it .</context>

      <context> Mare_Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it . These contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio_brightness with latitude . Very recently , observations have been made at 8 - mm wave_length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2 ' ( Amenitskii , Noskova , and Salomonovich , 1960 ) . The constant <head>temperature</head> contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm by Coates ( 1959 a ) , and apparently the emission at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features . Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave_lengths in_order_that the radio_emission of the moon can be properly interpreted . The observations of Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described .

      <context> This result suggests a very high_temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black_body merely by coincidence . For the case of Jupiter , the radio_emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non thermal components . Of the remaining planets , only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio_sources , and not very much information is available . Mars has been observed twice at about 3 - cm wave_length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known <head>temperature</head> of Mars . The low intensity of the radiation from Saturn has limited observations , but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin . No attempts to measure the radio_emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small diameters , or low_temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave_lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity . In_spite of this , the very large radio_reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio_emission of most of the planets in a_few years .</context>

      <context> This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25 - cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) . They deduced from their measurements that the radio_emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less_than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared_emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio_emission came about 3 - 1 2 days after Full_Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared_emission , which reaches its maximum at Full_Moon . Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing_out that rocklike materials which are likely to make_up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio_waves , although opaque to infrared_radiation . The infrared_emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the <head>temperature</head> variation due_to solar_radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase . Since the absorption of radio_waves in rocklike material varies with wave_length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material . The radio_emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when Burke and Franklin ( 1955 ) identified the origin of interference like radio_noise on their records at about 15 meters wave_length as emission from Jupiter . This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 ) .</context>

One of the important aspects of_this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator .</context>

      <context> The oxidation pond has a surface_area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 ft . The pond is currently serving 1230 persons or 260 persons per acre . In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors . It was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond by regular additions of sodium_nitrate until the <head>temperature</head> decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green to green_algae . The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium_nitrate . At_the_same_time further expansion in the Red_Bridge_Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities . The large land_areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer .</context>

Jubal said that his night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown_up , and Mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to_it ; his foster_parents had taught him to see . As for the night being warm , he would have been comfortable naked on Mount_Everest but his water_brothers had little tolerance for changes in <head>temperature</head> and pressure ; he was considerate of their weakness , once he learned of_it . But he was looking_forward to snow - seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual , as he had read - walking barefoot , rolling in it .

      <context> Quite candidly , fellows , I would n't be_in_your_shoes for all the rice in China . As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly . Sometime on Saturday evening , August 22nd , while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria_dell_'Orso , in Rome , you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks_County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . Hastening to the attic , the <head>temperature</head> of_which was easily hotter than the Gold_Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the_like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there . What you were looking_for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis_rackets and fly screens ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph_records scattered about a fumed_oak Victrola , you danced two tangos and a paso_doble , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu . You then descended one story , glommed a television_set from the music room - the only constructive feature of your visit , by_the_way - and , returning to the ground_floor , entered the master_bedroom . From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade handled magnifying_glass .</context>
