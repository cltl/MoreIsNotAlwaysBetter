      <context> A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve . Never_mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination : the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land_mass was under the domination and influence of the West . Today , Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging , it would seem , into the Soviet orbit . <head>Latin_America</head> was once an area as `` safe '' for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon . Today it is up_for_grabs . One Latin_American country , Cuba , has become a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast . In some countries the trend has gone further than others :</context>

But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard_to most_of the rest of the world .

A nation such_as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied_upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin_American countries ; out_of_the_question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa .
