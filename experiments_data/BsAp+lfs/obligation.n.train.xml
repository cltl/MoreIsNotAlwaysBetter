      <context> It permits the state to take_over bank_accounts , stocks and other personal_property of persons missing for seven years or more . The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance_firms , pipeline_companies and other corporations to report such property to the state_treasurer . The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . Dewey_Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas_Bankers_Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual <head>obligations</head> with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . `` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . `` You take out_of circulation many millions of dollars '' . Rep._Charles_E._Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would `` amount to making a gift out_of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline_companies '' .</context>

      <context> Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double_play . Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting_up Tuttle 's 390 - foot homer over the wall in left center . If the Orioles are to break their losing_streak within the next two days , it will have to be at_the_expense_of the American_League champion New_York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night_game and a single test Sunday afternoon . The flavor of Baltimore 's Florida_Grapefruit_League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron_Hansen has fulfilled his <head>obligations</head> under the Army 's military training_program and is ready for belated spring_training . Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove_in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average , completes the Birds ' spring squad at 49 players . The big , 22 - year old shortstop , the 1960 American_league `` rookie of the year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $ 15000 and was a spectator at tonight 's 5 - to 3 loss to Kansas_City - the winless Birds ' sixth setback in_a_row . The 6 - foot 3 inch Hansen checked_in close_to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting_weight last spring .</context>

      <context> This seems like a large_order . The interior_designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance . Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior_designer does know all this and does practice it . And further he must understand his <head>obligation</head> to the client to not_only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society . Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum . It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise . The old established independent art_schools try their best to fulfill their obligations .</context>

Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show_pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public_relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior_design . It is possible , of_course , to work_on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so_that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior_design demands .</context>

      <context> The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family_planning . Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed . Family_planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring . Pope_Pius_12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal <head>obligation</head> of parenthood for a long_time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such_as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications '' . This means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring . These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics in family_planning . The laws of many states permit birth_control only for medical reasons .</context>

      <context> Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead rigid and inflexible in their policies . American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes . It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies . We have every <head>obligation</head> to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways . We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period_of_time . With the exception of treaty making , foreign relations were historically concerned for_the_most_part with conditions of short or at_least measurable duration . Foreign_policy now takes_on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection .</context>

The displacement ( at_least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international_law theory and doctrine . In_the_first_place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal_system .</context>
