      <context> A British writer , Richard_Haestier , in a book , Dead_Men_Tell_Tales , recalls that in the turmoil preceding French_Revolution the body of Henry_/4 , , who had died nearly 180 years earlier , was torn to pieces by a mob . And in England , after the Restoration , the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn . The head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster , and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows . Contemplating these posthumous <head>punishments</head> , Stalin should not lose all hope . In 1899 , Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster , facing Whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands . Nikita_Khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself . The Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy , Moscow is a crowded city , and the creed of communism deplores waste .</context>

      <context> This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek speaking ones . They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history . Death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience . It represents a <head>punishment</head> that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time . These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified . The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated . Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and_then older and_then still older , in_short , whether Adam 's life was intended to be part of the process of time .</context>

      <context> Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and_then older and_then still older , in_short , whether Adam 's life was intended to be part of the process of time . If it was , then it must have been God 's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity . One night , so some of these theories run , Adam would have fallen_asleep , much_as he fell_asleep for the creation of Eve ; and thus he would have been carried_over into the life_eternal . The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a <head>punishment</head> , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural_order of time and change . On_the_other_hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence . It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law . If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator .</context>

Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history .</context>

      <context> We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates . For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody . Professionally a lawyer , that_is_to_say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed_up , disguised - that_is , paradoxically , revealed - as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child . That this abandonment takes_place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring_down upon him the <head>punishment</head> for art ; that_is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann 's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even_though the constant elements of the artist nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and La^utner . It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann 's early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic . In a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one_and_the_same . Something of this can be learned from `` The_Way_to_the_Churchyard '' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure .</context>

      <context> In its account of the Trafton lecture , the Providence_Daily_Post said that the remarks of Rev._Trafton made the people indignant . No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence_Daily_Post , for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state_prison who were a_thousand times more deserving of sympathy . The Providence_Daily_Journal , however , stated that Brown 's courage , bravery , and heroism `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; it gives something of dignity even to a bad one '' . The Woonsocket_Patriot admitted that John_Brown might deserve <head>punishment</head> or imprisonment `` but he should no_more be hung than Henry_A._Wise or James_Buchanan '' . The Newport_Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him . In her letter to John_Brown , `` E._B. '' , the Quakeress from Newport , had suggested that the American people owed more honor to John_Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George_Washington . During the latter days of November to the day of Brown 's execution , it seems that most Rhode_Islanders did not concur in `` E._B. 's '' suggestion .</context>

      <context> A New_York kid , a refugee from one of the Harlem gangs , made_fun of Trig 's accent , and drew a knife .

The fear of <head>punishment</head> just did n't bother him . It was n't there . It was left_out of him at_birth . This is why he made such a magnificent soldier .</context>

For His mercy and His guidance to spare you from evil and eternal <head>punishment</head> in the Lake_of_Fire '' . Stevie had heard these words many times , yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble . For he feared the Lake_of_Fire . He strove to think of God and His eternal wrath ; he must pray to be spared .</context>

      <context> Jessica_Packard lifted her head and followed the retreating figure , her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips . For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; then she snorted and groped_for her fork . There 's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green_beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling_away of a family . Procreation , expansion , proliferation - these are the laws of living_things , with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in <head>punishments</head> : oblivion . When the fate of the individual is visited on the group , then ( the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently ) , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted . And indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth . She was the last living of the older generation .</context>

      <context> Fourteen of the sculptures you took posses properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls_out in patches . In_time , these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce , riddling you with frambesia , the king's_evil , sheep_rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry_out_for release . All this , though , is simply a prelude , a curtain-raiser , for what ensues , and I doubt whether any Occidental could accurately forecast it . If , however , it would help to intensify your anguish , I can delimit the powers of a_few of the divinities you 've affronted and describe the <head>punishment</head> they meted_out in one analogous instance . Hold_on tight . First_of_all , the six figures of the Buddha you heisted - four Siamese heads , a black obsidian statuette in the earth touching position , and a large brass figure of the Dying_Buddha on a teakwood base . Now , you probably share the widespread Western belief that the Lord_Buddha is the most compassionate of the gods , much more so than Jehovah and Allah and the rest .</context>
