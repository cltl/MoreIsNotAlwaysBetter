      <context> Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call ' clicking ' . `` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do_well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition . `` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color . Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of <head>light</head> and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in_relation_to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat . When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor - if I have been working on a full sheet in the field . `` When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal . When this linear draft is completed , I dust it down to a faint image .</context>

      <context> In analyzing the watercolors of Roy_Mason , the first thing that comes_to_mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate . Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with <head>lights</head> ; a middle_distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .</context>

      <context> Inspiring - yes ; instructive - maybe ; duplicable - no ! But for the technical fact , we have the artist 's own testimony : `` Of_late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors . First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately * * f inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values - the lightest <head>light</head> , the middle tone , and the darkest dark - by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns . If a human figure or wild_life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch . For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose . `` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .</context>

      <context> A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible_light with ultraviolet_radiation and combines a microscope with a color - TV_system to view the results . Fig. 1 is a simplified block_diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical_Electronics_Center of Rockefeller_Institute . By combining the talents of a medical_man , Dr._Aterman , a biophysicist , Mr._Berkely , and an electronics expert , Dr._Zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes . Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet_radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in_front_of the three mercury xenon <head>lights</head> which serve as the ultraviolet sources . These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; the specimen is magnified by the microscope . Instead of the observer 's eye the image_orthicon in the TV_camera does the `` looking '' .

It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends - expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings .

      <context> the crude sketch of Piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of , for_instance , Naphta and Leverku^hn . In method as_well_as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism '' , anticipates a kind of musical_composition , as_well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as Leverku^hn says , `` there shall be nothing unthematic '' . It resembles , too , pictures such_as Du^rer and Bruegel did , in which all that looks at_first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for_example , or a deadly_sin . `` Gladius_Dei '' ( 1902 ) resembles `` The_Way_to_the_Churchyard '' in its representation of a conflict between <head>light</head> and dark , between `` Life '' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict .

Hieronymus , like Piepsam , makes his protest quite in_vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating ; he is simply thrown_out of the shop by the porter . On the street outside , Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence , and prophetically he issues his curse : `` Gladius_Dei super terram cito et velociter '' .</context>
