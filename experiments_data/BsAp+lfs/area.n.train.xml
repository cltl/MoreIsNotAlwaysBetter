      <context> The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick_Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park . It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . THE DENVER-AREA TV_audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home_runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob_Howsam that the games are not to be blacked_out when his Bears are playing at_home . This rule providing_for a blackout of televised baseball 30_minutes before the start of a major or minor_league game in any <head>area</head> comes from the game 's top rulers . The last couple of years the Bears management got_the_business from the `` Living_Room_Athletic_Club '' when games were cut_off . Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy . This year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide_by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here .</context>

Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley_Hinton in the third inning .</context>

      <context> But at_least the pessimists who believed that the world_organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong . No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade . These are mentalities which crave action - and they are beginning to get_it , as Messrs._Salsich and Engh report on page 372 . Even in <head>areas</head> where political connotations are ( deliberately ? ) left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading . Friends , a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary_organization of employees of the Gulf_Telephone_Company at Foley , Alabama . `` If the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf_Coast '' , the account reads , `` they can count_on heavy opposition from a group of commando trained telephone employees - all girls .</context>

      <context> The stained-glass_windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas , the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political_platform . The vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a_thousand unexpected guests for lunch . Larkin has an answer to all that . The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking <head>areas</head> , for_example , will provide needed space for the extra television_sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids . Also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented . It 's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse . He does n't really need the immense sum_of_money ( probably converted from American gold on the London_Exchange ) he makes them pay .</context>

      <context> He has to ; he just can n't do anything about it at_all ! But as you can also see , it 's not a painful exercise at_all , because Henri_de_Courcy - the `` happy '' bodybuilder - looks as though he were having the time of his life ! The last exercise of Roland_Claude 's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a_bit longer pause between sets . By this time Henri 's entire chest back - lat shoulder <head>area</head> is pumped-up to almost bursting point , and Claude takes time to do a_bit more pectoral front deltoid shaping work . He has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline_Bench_Press ( note the high incline ) . This gives a wide flare to the pecs , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and lats . This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests that steel edged `` carved out_of solid rock '' looks of the great champions .</context>

      <context> In his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked_out '' equipment since Vic_Tanny . Mr._Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now famous Weider_Push-Pull_Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . So right_away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull_Super-Set consisting_of the wide grip Straight-Arm_Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull_Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib_cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar Bench_Press which specifically works_on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids . As you can see , in this Push-Pull_Super_Set the entire chest back shoulder <head>area</head> is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises , so the complete torso remains pumped-up all_the_time ! Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 1 , the professor allows him about a five minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 2 . Super-Set No. 2 is made_up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat_benches . The `` push '' exercise of this Push-Pull_Super-Set is the Bench_Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation .</context>

      <context> The quantity of water flow may be critical ; a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer . If the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied . Check the quality of the water .

      <context> In analyzing the watercolors of Roy_Mason , the first thing that comes_to_mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate . Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light <head>area</head> with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; a middle_distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .</context>

      <context> `` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him . Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition . If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result . Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major <head>areas</head> on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call ' clicking ' . `` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do_well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition . `` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color . Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in_relation_to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat .</context>

The husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job - often an organization man whose motto for getting_ahead is : `` Do n't rock_the_boat '' . Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage . Hemmed_in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex_act so he can be supreme in at_least one <head>area</head> . More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home . Some psychologists , in_fact , suggest that career bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives . The wife 's attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job .</context>

      <context> George_W._Cable ( naturalized New_Englander ) , writing in 1889 from `` Paradise_Road , Northampton '' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the `` Southern question '' .

There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small <head>area</head> the chief universities , colleges , and preparatory_schools of the United_States . Why should this be so ? It is true that New_England , more_than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start . But I think that something more than this is involved .</context>

      <context> Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society . Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by_any_means other_than the corporate form , e._g. constructing major airports or dams . Thus , if corporations are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject_to public control and needs . In all other <head>areas</head> , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services . Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human_beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests . Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot . It can project long-range goals for itself .</context>

He has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern .

Very small particles , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar_bed of the lungs . This <head>area</head> is highly susceptible to infection . The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intra tissue inoculation . The relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in Table 1 . In considering BW defense , it must be recognized that a number of critical meteorological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect .</context>

After this brief discussion of neo - , paleocortical , and cortico-hypothalamic relations , let us return once_more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance . Facilitatory processes take_place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways . Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute <head>area</head> in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges . On_the_other_hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored . Apparently , a positive_feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral_cortex . Consequently , if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level , the lessened hypothalamic cortical discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges .</context>

The result is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4 . Swadesh , and therefore Hoijer , felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera ( fox , vulture , salmon , yellow_pine , manzanita ) ; their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , bark , root ) .</context>

      <context> Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process . The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco . At the central level the scrutin_uninominal_voting_system was selected over some form of the scrutin_de_liste_system , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political_parties . The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote <head>areas</head> of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections . Although the elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates . With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly . Both parties and the Ministry_of_the_Interior were busily at_work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance .</context>

The P.D.I. and later the Popular_Movement protected the Istiqlal 's `` privileged position '' until the fall of Balafrej , and_then the Istiqlal used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the pro U.N.F.P. tendencies of the Ibrahim government . The bulk of the preparation had , of_course , proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry_of_the_Interior , whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics . Apart from some <head>areas</head> of recurring trouble , like Bani_Mellal , where inexperienced officials had been appointed , there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process . Centrally , however , the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage . The King decided to remove Ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a non-party Council_of_Government under his personal direction .

In later collages of both masters , a variety of extraneous materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in_conjunction_with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think_of . The <head>area</head> adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material - or simply of a painted in form - will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth . Planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially . All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so_as to encompass fictive space in_front of the surface as_well_as behind it . Flatness may now monopolize everything , but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn_into illusion itself - at_least an optical if_not , properly_speaking , a pictorial illusion .</context>

But here again , the surface declaring device both overshoots and falls_short_of its aim . For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives_way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief , which gives_way in_turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seems to contain both - or neither . Because of the size of the <head>areas</head> it covers , the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily , as more than an indication or sign . Literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerangs : the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before . Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it , the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as_well_as start his picture .

It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities .

The high cost of land and a_few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume .
