      <context> Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day_schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf <head>students</head> in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . It would authorize the Texas_Education_Agency to establish county-wide day_schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of_age to attend the day_schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas_School_for_the_Deaf here . Operating_budget for the day_schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El_Paso would be $ 451500 , which would be a savings of $ 157460 yearly after the first year 's capital outlay of $ 88000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate .</context>

      <context> One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken_place since the mid 19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge_Universities . At Oxford one_hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 . Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs . Now , not_only are there considerably more laity as <head>students</head> and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious_orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non_Catholic members of the University . Some Catholic priests lecture there ; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students . Further evidence that Roman_Catholicism enjoys a more favorable_position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to_it in the mass_media of England . The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester_Guardian and the Sunday_Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic_Church is now at_least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches .</context>

      <context> The lyric beauties of Schubert 's Trout_Quintet - its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies - make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners . But for <head>students</head> of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems . Since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall_into the category of chamber_music - yet it calls_for a double_bass , an instrument generally regarded_as symphonic . Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather_than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing .</context>

      <context> Artur_Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable . But Schnabel was a great teacher in_addition_to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford_Curzon , Frank_Glazer , Adrian_Aeschbacher , and Victor_Babin ) also sheds_light_on the master 's pedagogical skills . Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in_that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) . But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel 's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each <head>student</head> 's approach as distinctly his own . Schnabel 's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one . Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .</context>

      <context> Not_only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent_to certification to teach the subject . Participation for the educator in this case , however , would have_to be raised to full and complete membership . The largest of these organizations at_present denies to the full_time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog . This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the <head>students</head> . The professor in_turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice .

Only a_few years ago a middle_western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior_design . At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art '' . This kind of irresponsibility toward their <head>students</head> can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer . We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior_design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take_on the usual accompaniments of teaching - minimal income and minimal status among their confreres . Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such_as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable .

      <context> It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior_designer 's training . We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior_design <head>student</head> as not having serious bearing on the subject . The real question that follows is - how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? The American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course . An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior_design , for_the_most_part schools accredited by membership in the National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art , and a further `` on_the_spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations .</context>

      <context> That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant . As_long_as his material is Americana , can in_some_way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied . From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth century American folklore . On the one side we have the university professors and their <head>students</head> , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought_out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make_up this nation . On the other we have the flag_wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways . After_all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates .</context>

Does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall_tale and a true product of the folk ?

In their first two years in high_school , Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams .

It is significant , too , that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that Jewish <head>students</head> tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts . The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys . The motivations for both sexes , to_be_sure , are different .

      <context> In my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational_programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city .

      <context> It is at_least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break_down barriers of inequality in the South . I should_like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect_to vocational education . First_and_foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic_program for graduation . Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more_than half the <head>student</head> 's time in those years ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought_to begin earlier . Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality . This last point is important because if high_school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational_program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .</context>

In the work of every artist , I suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the <head>student</head> as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about ; not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image , a single moment . So here . The horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone_wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed_up as a whore dressing_up as a baby ; the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; the bringing_together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering '' ) ; the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant - all this seems a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ; beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann 's work . When I try to work_out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , I come_up with the following ideas , which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay .</context>

It would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep_schools of New_England . A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating_class of nearly one_thousand at Yale ; that_is , about one-half of one per_cent , which looks pretty `` tokenish '' to me , especially in an institution which professes to be `` national '' .

      <context> Our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries . Very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or `` belongs_to '' some way of thought labelled as a `` school '' or an `` - ism '' , i._e. a complex or `` syndrome '' of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification . Thus ideas like `` grace '' , `` salvation '' , and `` providence '' cluster together in traditional Christianity . Usually the work studied offers us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in_question , so that the <head>student</head> finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an `` - ism '' or mode of thought . Accordingly we may speak_of the Platonism peculiar to Shelley 's poems or the type of Stoicism present in Henley 's `` Invictus '' , and we may find that describing such Platonism or such Stoicism and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise . After_all , Shelley is no `` orthodox '' or Hellenic Platonist , and even his `` romantic '' Platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries . Again , Henley 's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self mastery is far from characteristic of a Stoic thinker like Marcus_Aurelius , whose gentle acquiescence is almost Christian , comparable_to the patience expressed in Milton 's sonnet on his own blindness .</context>

      <context> This is what was meant , above , by describing history as inferential . The knowledge in_virtue_of_which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events '' . It is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by_no_means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research . The <head>student</head> of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at_the_same_time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another . Let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought - turning our attention from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades . We may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts .

      <context> No one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them . Still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature . The actual moments of contact are vitally important . These moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the <head>student</head> of comparative_literature must be frequently concerned . Perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the Western world has been that of the Old and New_Testament . Certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of Western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the Bible .

      <context> We may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists . English philosopher Samuel_Alexander 's debt to Wordsworth and Meredith is a recent interesting example , as also A._N._Whitehead 's understanding of the English romantics , chiefly Shelley and Wordsworth . Hegel 's profound admiration for the insights of the Greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth century philosophy . Again the <head>student</head> of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating , if to our minds grotesque , anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural elimination of the unfit in Lucretius , who in_turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher Empedocles . Here an important caveat is in_order . We must avoid the notion , suggested to some people by examples such_as those just mentioned , that ideas are `` units '' in_some_way comparable_to coins or counters that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even , for_that_matter , from one individual to another .</context>

At this point a working definition of idea is in_order , although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed .

It is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy .</context>

      <context> Thus Burns 's `` My love is like a red , red rose '' and Hopkins ' `` The thunder-purple sea beach , plumed purple of thunder '' although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned . On_the_other_hand , Arnold 's `` The unplumbed , salt , estranging sea '' , taken in its context , certainly does so . Understanding a work_of_art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies . Thus the <head>student</head> of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject_matter typical or atypical of its period . Again , he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways . Our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries . Very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or `` belongs_to '' some way of thought labelled as a `` school '' or an `` - ism '' , i._e. a complex or `` syndrome '' of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification .</context>

      <context> State and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities . There is a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school_boards in existing programs . A related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided . There is little evidence that existing public or private training_programs have any great difficulty getting <head>students</head> to enroll in their programs , even though they must pay tuition , receive no subsistence payments , and are not guaranteed a job . However , there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training . Again , one major difficulty is the local focus .

      <context> Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . This probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment_compensation or a Youth_Conservation_Corps . A maximum of $ 600 per_year per <head>student</head> would enable many to take training away from home . A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor . Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training . Such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located .</context>

      <context> For a number of years Kentucky , Louisiana and several other states have been building state sponsored vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties . These schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts . Transportation may be provided from nearby school districts . Courses are provided mainly for post high_school day programs ; but sometimes arrangements also are made for high_school <head>students</head> to attend , and evening extension courses also may be conducted . The Title 8 , program of the National_Defense_Education_Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools . By 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states . They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas .</context>

The modern <head>student</head> , who knows what was to come next , is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century .

      <context> In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original - a new thing . It is not merely a new thing ; it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; most_of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism . But to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin_Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine 's encounter with man . New , indeed , is Luther 's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern <head>students</head> what Luther was getting at . Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in_theory or in_practice . Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; even houses changed once a decade ; six hours of manual_labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; no private_property , no money ; no sort of pricing at_all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term .</context>

      <context> For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat <head>students</head> sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor .

Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after_all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks_Atkinson retired .</context>
