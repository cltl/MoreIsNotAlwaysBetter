      <context> If they are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation . The direction of the tension of minimum pressure is , of_course , given by the direction of the major_axis of the ellipsoids . Mason and Taylor both show that the major_axis of the ellipsoids is at 45 ` at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear . ( Some <head>suspensions</head> break_up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup . ) This is , of_course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies . The relative forces can be calculated from the various radii_of_curvature if we assume : ( A ) The surface_tension is uniform on the surface of the drop . ( B ) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions .</context>

      <context> Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics . Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assessment techniques . Much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures . The intra nasal instillation of a fluid <head>suspension</head> of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organisms . The importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated . The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory_tract , such_as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi , are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence . Very small particles , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar_bed of the lungs .</context>

      <context> From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34000 square_miles was covered . These dosages could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case . The behavior of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field_trial conducted with a non pathogenic organism . An aqueous <head>suspension</head> of the spores of B. subtilis , var. niger , generally known as Bacillus_globigii , was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles . A satisfactory cloud was produced even_though these nozzles were only about 5 per_cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns . In this test , 130 gallons of a suspension , having a count of * * f organisms per ml , or a total of approximately * * f spores , was aerosolized . The spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval vessel , cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-shore breeze .</context>

      <context> This serum exhibited titers of 1 : 16 in albumin and 1 : 256 by the indirect_Coombs_test . These antibody titers were determined by reaction with homozygous * * f red_cells . Anti - A and anti - B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A , group B or group O donors by the following tube agglutination methods . One drop of each sample was added to one drop of a 2 % <head>suspension</head> of group * * f or group B red_cells in a small * * f test_tube . In several instances group O cells were also used as controls . The red_cells were used within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline before use .
