Distribution_costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties - and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job .

      <context> In this model , we abstract from all non wage sources of cost changes , so that the `` public limit price '' only rises as the wage rate rises . In such circumstances , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate . Since marginal_costs rise when the wage rate rises , the profit_maximizing price also rises when the public limit price is elevated , and is likely to remain well above the latter . The entry limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic <head>competition</head> , but unless general inflation permits profit_margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy , we might expect the public limit price to approach the entry limit price . The foreign entry limit price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage rates do not enter foreign costs directly . Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure . Whether or not it is in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends_upon the extent to which the public limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase .</context>

      <context> The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened . Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are .

Fear of the <head>competition</head> - always a great motivating force in the American economy - makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival 's shiny new branches . The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches . Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act_as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover . When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing .</context>
