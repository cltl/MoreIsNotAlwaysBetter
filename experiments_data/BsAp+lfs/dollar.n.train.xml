      <context> The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary 's court which has been under_fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation . The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating_procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand_juries , the Atlanta_Bar_Association and an interim citizens_committee . `` These actions should serve to protect in_fact and in_effect the court 's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . Regarding Atlanta 's new million <head>dollar</head> airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes_charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' . The jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' . On other matters , the jury recommended that : Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton_County_Jail and `` a doctor , medical_intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '' .</context>

      <context> State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called_for yesterday in a report of a `` blue_ribbon '' citizens_committee on the aid to dependent children program . The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New_York_City welfare consulting_firm , listed 10 long_range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case_load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million <head>dollars</head> , said C._Virgil_Martin , president of Carson_Pirie_Scott_+_Co. , committee chairman . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend_upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' .</context>

      <context> The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . Dewey_Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas_Bankers_Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . `` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . `` You take out_of circulation many millions of <head>dollars</head> '' . Rep._Charles_E._Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would `` amount to making a gift out_of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline_companies '' . His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott_Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor_B._Jones of Houston , J._B._Brady of Harlingen and Howard_Cox of Austin . Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts .</context>

      <context> `` Uncle_Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden_Twenties '' . We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano_sonatas , chamber_music , gavottes , and marches ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities . We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers . Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist <head>dollars</head> of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms . So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting_grounds of `` Uncle_Sam '' ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought . Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing .</context>

      <context> We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted . It may have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it did n't prevent the paintings from being exciting . He also had , at_times , an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker ; he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For_Christ's_sake , Donald , you 've got Prussian_blue all_over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all_over his pants as_well . Mrs._Monmouth thought_of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred <head>dollars</head> for a painting . It was all gravy , and Donald did n't need much to live_on ; none of us did . We shared the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap lodgings of one kind or another . Attending the life_class was my idea - or rather , Askington 's idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two would n't have gone if I had n't talked them into it .</context>

There was a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way . Nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going_to be taken drunk .
