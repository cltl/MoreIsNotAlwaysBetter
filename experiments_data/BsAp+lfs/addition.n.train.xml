      <context> Baltimore 's bulky spring_training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul_Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit . `` Take a ride on this one '' , Brooks_Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third_sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third inning two run double off the left centerfield wall tonight . It was the first of two doubles by Robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate . Just before game time , Robinson 's pretty wife , Connie informed him that an <head>addition</head> to the family can be expected late next summer . Unfortunately , Brooks ' teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven hit pitching of three Kansas_City rookie hurlers . Hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with Lee_MacPhail ; J._A._W._Iglehart , chairman of the Oriole board_of_directors , and Public_Relations_Director Jack_Dunn . Their flight was delayed , Dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane .</context>

      <context> They stick_to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it . Treat them right and they 'll make a showing every_month in the year except the frigid ones . Give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they 'll repay your solicitude with beauty . A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful <head>addition</head> to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special . This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocado anywhere in the United_States . It has a great many assets to recommend it and if you have n't made avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should . You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted .</context>

      <context> The dweller at p is last to hear about a new cure , the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses , the one who goes the farthest to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting_over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort . Since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such_as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar_maple camp . Location theorists have given these matters much consideration . The networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not_only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the <head>addition</head> of new machines of war . They also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitored . Without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy party . The need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling .</context>

      <context> It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical_reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation_energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free_radicals , as_well_as information on the heat_of_dissociation of the carbon halogen bond . The reaction of chlorine with carbon_tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies . It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid . It should be possible to free carbon_tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to <head>addition</head> of radioactive chlorine . Furthermore , the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain_reaction since the activation_energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high ; also it would be expected that * * f would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for * * f radicals . Contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish , even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents . We are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation_energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon_tetrachloride .</context>

      <context> On_the_other_hand , there are a_few antithyroid drugs of this same general type , such as resorcinol , possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine . Any of the antithyroid drugs , of either type , if given in large enough doses for a long period_of_time will cause goitre , owing to inhibition of thyroid_hormone synthesis , with production of hypothyroidism . The anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased output of TSH , causing the thyroid to enlarge . The effect of drugs that act_on the iodide concentrating mechanism can be counteracted by <head>addition</head> of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet . The antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type , however , are not antagonised by such means . Besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol types , certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods . The most conclusively identified is L - 5 - vinyl - 2 - thio_oxazolidone , which was isolated from rutabaga ( Greer , 1950 ) .</context>

      <context> Interestingly enough , the effect of the digitalis_glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as_yet completely understood . However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . In the absence of <head>additions</head> to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; De_Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so_far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in_vitro by cell-free systems . In_addition , the iodoamino_acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen_peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) .</context>

      <context> The only requirements on dictionary information made by the text lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms . This leaves the ordering of entries variable . ( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it . ) Two very useful ways for modifying a form dictionary are the <head>addition</head> to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more_than one dictionary form . The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage . The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents . Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at_once .</context>

      <context> The actual power requirements indicated 2 lb oxygen transfer / hr / hp . The polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per_cent , indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather_than through the surface . During this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted . Shortly after this study ended septic conditions resulted which required the <head>addition</head> of sodium_nitrate . The location of the oxidation pond in a high value residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer . The organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from 160 to 270 mg / l of BOD with an average of 230 mg / l . The BOD data are given in Table 4 , .</context>

      <context> The oxidation pond has a surface_area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 ft . The pond is currently serving 1230 persons or 260 persons per acre . In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors . It was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond by regular <head>additions</head> of sodium_nitrate until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green to green_algae . The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium_nitrate . At_the_same_time further expansion in the Red_Bridge_Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities . The large land_areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer .</context>

      <context> She told me . ZING was the creation of two men , Louis_Thor and Bill_Blake , partners in ZING ! , Inc. . They 'd peddled the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when - with the <head>addition</head> of `` SX-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising_campaign - sales had soared practically into orbit . Their product had been endorsed by Good_Housekeeping , the A._M._A. , and the Veterinary_Journal , among other repositories of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you did n't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friends would think you did n't bathe . My lovely caller - Joyce_Holland was her name - had previously done three filmed commercials for ZING , and this_evening , the fourth , a super production , had been filmed at the home of Louis_Thor . The water in Thor 's big swimming_pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds - fashioned , of_course , from ZING - Joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious `` bath '' while cameras rolled .</context>
