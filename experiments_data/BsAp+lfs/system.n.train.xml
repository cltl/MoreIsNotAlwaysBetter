      <context> Of_course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr._Fisher , then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury , to the Vatican last December . It was the first time an English Primate has done this since the 14th century . English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope . Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants ; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary_school during the sickness of one of its masters ; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` Catholics , if the present <head>system</head> is still in_operation , will constitute almost one-third of the House_of_Lords in the next generation '' ; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic_church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave .</context>

      <context> A sonar or radar type of pulse_generator and time-delay_measuring_system is required for body tissue evaluation .

A still more sophisticated <head>system</head> has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself . It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream . The latter measures the heat carried_away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow . It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart 's left_ventricle , to indicate the blood_pressure in the heart itself .</context>

      <context> Many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible_light and must be stained for microscopic investigation . This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or_else colors only the outside .

Fig. 1 is a simplified block_diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy <head>system</head> developed at the Medical_Electronics_Center of Rockefeller_Institute . By combining the talents of a medical_man , Dr._Aterman , a biophysicist , Mr._Berkely , and an electronics expert , Dr._Zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes . Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet_radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in_front_of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources . These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; the specimen is magnified by the microscope .</context>

      <context> The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or_else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery . The image of God has simply disappeared . All such imitations of negative quality have given_rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at_least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak_to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved . The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical <head>systems</head> . Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually_exclusive , that they belong together . Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being . And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written .</context>

      <context> For Plato , `` imitation '' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence . All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . In Plato 's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers . Presupposed in Plato 's <head>system</head> is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom . Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato . But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths .</context>

The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history . Some weapons_systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development . Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon_system , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive <head>systems</head> . This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons_systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_systems which have been overtaken by events . Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated .

It places certain values at_least beyond questioning and tampering . Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious <head>system</head> provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends .

Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide , minority parties , such_as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958 , clamor for elections when out of power , but are not at_all certain they wish_to be controlled by popular choice when in power . Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process . The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco .</context>

Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained_workers .
