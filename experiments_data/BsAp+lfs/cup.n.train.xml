      <context> The part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate , `` It could have been like that for only a_little while '' ; but true memory does not count nor add : it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time . Once , then - for how many years or how few does not matter - my world was bound round by fences , when I was too small to reach the apple_tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull myself up . That world was in scale with my own smallness . I have no picture in my mind of the garden as_a_whole - that I could not see - but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory : wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November ; ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned_over by a dusty slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown edged holes ; hot colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on_our_way to the pump with the half gourd tied to it as a <head>cup</head> by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it . It was mother who planted the verbenas . I think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener : she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren .</context>

      <context> Most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such_as a deserted mouse_nest , a bird_house , or the hole made by a woodpecker ; some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss . Once she has made_up_her_mind , the queen starts_out by constructing , in her chosen abode , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some woolly material . On this , she builds an `` egg compartment '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous pollen and nectar mixture called beebread . She also builds one or two waxen <head>cups</head> which she fills with honey . Then , a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed . The queen afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen , taking a sip from_time_to_time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots . When the larvae hatch , they feed_on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother .</context>

      <context> They were poems in a strange language , of which he could barely touch a meaning - enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sensed there . Brittany , that stone-gray mystery through which he traveled for thirty days , sleeping in the barns of farmers or alongside roads , had worked some subtle change in him , he knew , and it was in Brittany that he had met Pierre . Pierre had no hands ; they had been severed at the wrists . With leather <head>cups</head> fitted in his handlebars , he steered his bicycle . He and Warren had traveled together for four days . They visited the shipyards at Brest and Pierre had_to sign the register , vouching for the integrity of the visiting foreigner . He took the pen in his stumps and began to write .</context>

      <context> But they , naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at_large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles . How titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals . The furor was such_that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational . And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a <head>cup</head> of chocolate in a cafe , Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration , trembling lest his authorship become known , and at_the_same_time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer . He felt himself now , as he himself says in his Confessions , at a crucial point of his life . And that was why , on the day of the performance , when a carriage from the royal stables called to take him to the palace , he did not bother to shave . On_the_contrary , he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days .</context>

The previous night 's horror - the absolute failure , overcast with the intrusions of the press , had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness , of play-acting . Sipping their coffee , discussing the weather , the day 's shopping , Fritzie 's commitments at the network ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoided the radio , the morning TV news_show , even the front page of the Santa_Luisa_Register , resting on the kitchen bar .</context>

      <context> `` Le petit_dejeuner '' , Harold said , in an accent that did credit to Miss_Sloan , his high-school French_teacher . At_the_same_time , his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here , and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable , peace-loving , and dependable in everybody . Since ordinary breakfast-table conversation was impossible , it was at_least something that they were able to offer Eugene the sugar_bowl with their sugar in it , and the plate of bread_and_butter , and that Eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first . Eugene put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his <head>cup</head> and then filled it with hot water . Stirring , he said : `` I am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with you today '' . They assured him that they did not expect or need to be entertained .

      <context> Maude was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish . Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to New_York . Maude could have shot Emile - if she 'd had a reason to kill him . There was no use in standing there in the drizzle , trying to find a link between Emile 's murder and opium in a <head>cup</head> of coffee . She started back for the house , saw a light in the office , opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder . Rev , George and Lolotte were mending shoes . a lighted lamp stood on the table that dusky , drizzling day .</context>

She had swished away , she had been gone for a long_time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought_to stop her , pour_out the coffee , so no_one would drink it . But_then the so-called coffee was bad enough at_best , cold it was all_but undrinkable - especially that <head>cup</head> ! She was deeply , horribly sure that Lucien had filled it with opium . She had quarreled with Lucien , she had resisted his demands for money - and if she died , by the provisions of her marriage_contract , Lucien would inherit legally not_only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office , but later , when the war was over , her father 's entire estate .

      <context> So Lolotte - or anybody - could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied_with the missing bottle of opium . That was not reasonable either . The opium had disappeared before Emile 's death and whoever shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen Sarah 's own doubts and suspicions - and questions . She began to doubt whether there had been in_fact a lethal_dose of opium in the <head>cup</head> . So suppose somebody only wished to frighten her , so she would leave Honotassa ! That made a certain amount of logic . Added to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot , she might even have drunk some of it , she would n't have taken enough to kill her , for she would have been warned by its taste .</context>

      <context> For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a <head>cup</head> of hot coffee . They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor . The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue_pie , gets a plate of English_muffins instead . Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after_all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks_Atkinson retired .</context>

A biting , pithy parable of the all pervading hollowness of modern life , the piece has been set by Mlle_Lagoon to a sumptuous score ( a single motif played over_and_over by four thousand French_horns ) by existentialist hot-shot Jean-Paul_Sartre . Petite , lovely Yvette_Chadroe plays the nymphomaniac engagingly .</context>
