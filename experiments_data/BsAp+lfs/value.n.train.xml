      <context> Command 's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one . Like the recent Scheherazade from London ( High_Fidelity , Sept. 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather_than on creating sensational effects . Because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers ' triumph . The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical <head>values</head> . The engineering as_such never obtrudes_upon your consciousness . The effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance . This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not_only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue .</context>

Our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future . We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening . Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of <head>value</head> , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience . It takes a great_deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one 's world simply as a collection of sense_data arranged in such_and_such sequence and pattern , devoid_of all power to move the feelings and actions except in_so_far as they present themselves for inspection . Whitehead is here questioning David_Hume 's understanding of the nature of experience ; he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from Hume 's presupposition that experience is merely sense_data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived . What Hume calls `` sensation '' is what Whitehead calls `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy '' which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy .</context>

      <context> Accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which I shall call mimesis in_order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) . The word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle . For Plato , `` imitation '' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence . All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth <head>value</head> of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . In Plato 's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers . Presupposed in Plato 's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom . Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level .</context>

There is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special <head>value</head> for our time . In B._M._Spinley 's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience .

      <context> In any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions , particularly with_respect_to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature '' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required . In the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for_example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiments or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy_life regarded_as forbidden , or by half conscious ideas about the magical_power of words ? These are , if the research is done with subtlety and skill , researchable topics , but the research is missing . One of the most frequent views of the <head>value</head> of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide .

      <context> One growth center in a short_bone - distal phalanx of the second finger - was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short_bones , occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage . Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , dietary patterns , and health during adolescence . The following summary , based on Figures 5 and 6 , is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with_respect_to the appropriate mean age for each growth center . At the top of Figure 5 , for_example , the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according_to their mean and standard_deviation <head>values</head> in Table 1 . The 34 arrows , denoting onset age plus completion age deviations , have been arrayed in an Onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 34 girls . The growth center depicted here , in the distal phalanx of the second finger , is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short_bones . The mean onset age was 25.3 months ( Table 1 ) , and the average Span of the osseous stage was 133 months .</context>

      <context> Accordingly , if epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche , early and late menarches might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for the 18 girls with `` same schedule '' . As an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion . It is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group . A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive <head>value</head> of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage . Boys 32 , 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 had `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion ; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys . Boy 34 , like girl 2 , did not have `` same schedule '' ; his arrow crosses the line denoting the mean .

Therefore each binomial trial can be thought_of as producing a value of a random_variable associated with that trial and taking the <head>values</head> 0 and 1 , with probabilities q and p respectively . The several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random_variable X , the total number of successes , which is just the sum of the random_variables associated with the single trials . The marksman gets two bull's-eyes , one on his third shot and one on his fifth . The numbers of successes on the five individual shots are , then , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 .</context>

      <context> This set must consist_of isolated points and closed_intervals . The fact that there can not be any limit_points of the set except in closed_intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and **f are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point . This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points . In some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane , say **f , the function **f is either double valued or has no <head>values</head> defined , except at the tangent point itself , where it is single valued . A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and **f are tangent to one another . A continuous change in t through an amount e results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve **f . There are three possibilities : ( a ) **f remains tangent to C as it is translated ; ( b ) **f moves away from C and does not intersect it at_all for **f ; ( c ) **f cuts_across C and there are two ordinary intersections for every t in **f .</context>

      <context> His second conclusion , on semantic word_classes , agrees with mine . This second conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored .

Thus his persistence <head>values</head> for some stem frequencies per meaning is : stem identical in 8 languages , 100 % ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86 % ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , 64 % ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57 % . His formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material .

The local Istiqlal and U.M.C.I.A. offices did not campaign and lost heavily . The <head>value</head> of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as shown in Table /1 , . The chamber_of_Commerce elections were , of_course , an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections . The U.N.F.P. learned that its urban organization , which depends heavily on U.M.T. support , was most effective . The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete , precise problems of internal politics .</context>

      <context> The overall effect was probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than might have otherwise taken_place . A second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections . Although a somewhat technical subject , it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting_system indicated . Furthermore , the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative <head>value</head> and essential to evaluating election results . The sine_qua_non of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure . As the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated_by either party could fairly administer elections . The P.D.I. and later the Popular_Movement protected the Istiqlal 's `` privileged position '' until the fall of Balafrej , and_then the Istiqlal used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the pro U.N.F.P. tendencies of the Ibrahim government .</context>

      <context> It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only . If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at_all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like `` Hurrah '' or `` Fiddlesticks '' , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at_rest . This is the course the positivists took . They explained <head>value</head> judgments by explaining them away . Now I do not think their view will do .

      <context> This resulted in damage to the occipital_lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . In_any_event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` psychically blind '' , while at_the_same_time , apparently , the sense_of_touch remained essentially intact . Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for_example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure_up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . This circumstance in the patient 's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional <head>value</head> for the problem at_hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that_is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . The necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense_of_touch , as_such . We do not arrive_at spatial images by means of the sense_of_touch by itself . ( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual_sensation only by way of visual representations ; that_is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual_space '' .</context>

      <context> The new interchange among the four Los_Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square_mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller_Center in New_York . It is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls `` the highest and best use '' of centrally located urban land . As it affects the city 's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . Subways improved land <head>values</head> without taking_away land ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by_a_long_shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed . Downtown Los_Angeles is already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking_lot and garage - one of those preposterous `` if '' statistics has already come to pass . The freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access problem , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , isolating boundary . City planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might .</context>

      <context> The future could be worse . The plants along Route_128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New_England rocks and trees . They can even be rather grand , like Edward_Land 's monument to the astonishing success of Polaroid . But they deny the <head>values</head> of the city - the crowded , competitive , tolerant city , the `` melting_pot '' which gave_off so many of the most admirable American qualities . They are segregated businesses , combining again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work_force from segregated communities . It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts ' Route_128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements , or from the exploitation of patents which grant at_least a partial monopoly . While the factories were always the center of the labor_market , they were often on the city 's periphery .</context>

      <context> Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders . There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the startled horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are_born at the end of an ancestral line long_since divorced from money-making and which , besides , has kept its estate intact . She was personally sloppy , and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist , and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves .

She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp . `` Now drive carefully , for_God's_sake '' ! she called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure .

There was never a doubt any_more how his structures would be received ; it was always the same unqualified success now . He could no_longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here_and_there he was taken_to_task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no_longer disputable as to its other <head>values</head> . Stowey_Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality .
