Now , in 1961 , the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per_cent , or 5 million ) ; yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .</context>

      <context> I speak_of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved - ever - reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human_beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around . These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism . This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in_practice , antithetical to these conditions ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization . Moreover , as Communist power <head>increases</head> , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro_rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote . It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant , proximate goal of American policy . Proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive '' ends we seek , to which victory over Communism is but a means . But dominant in the sense that every other objective , no_matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it .</context>

      <context> The use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really radiates as a black_body , will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material . The radio_radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal_emission at centimeter wave_lengths , except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio_noise . The quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar_radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1 ` K . At meter wave_lengths and <head>increase</head> of the order of 10 ` K in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected . Therefore , neglecting the extreme outbursts , reflected solar_radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter - and decimeter wave-length range . Radio_observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave_lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm , and the results are summarized in Table 1 . Observations have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques ( Sinton , 1955 , 1956 , ; see_also chap. 11 ) .</context>

      <context> The Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive_force of the impinging solar_radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . The radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size - a 1000 - | m diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years . Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar corpuscular_radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . Further , the corpuscular_radiation , i.e. , the solar_wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant <head>increase</head> in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive_force to the gravitational_force . The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi major_axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor_axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . Also , planetary gravitational_attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . At one astronomical_unit from the sun ( the Earth 's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular .</context>

      <context> The diurnal_variation in the observed flux may be partly due_to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity . The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data . A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table 5 - 1 . From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit <head>increase</head> in magnitude . The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density * * f except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar_system in the presence of solar_radiation pressure . The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors . It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant .</context>

      <context> Such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at_once . Some of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial_arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches following along the pleural surface . With completion of filling , net-like anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches . An unusual <head>increase</head> in the number of bronchial_arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted . This was accounted_for primarily by the presence of a bronchial_artery closely following the pulmonary_artery . The diameter of this bronchial_artery was much too large for it to be a mere vasa_vasorum ( figs. 16 , 23 , 24 ) . In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary_artery .</context>

Sections of tumors incited by WTV were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum or conjugated antiserum to potato_yellow-dwarf_virus . After passing * * f through DEAE-cellulose , the titer of antibodies to WTV in the specific fraction was 1 : 4 of the titer before such passage ( precipitin ring tests by R._F._Whitcomb ) ; but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1 : 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining .

      <context> In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such_as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs . The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated . Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies_in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity . A state of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not_only an <head>increase</head> in the parasympathetic reactivity this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli , but leads also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus acting sympathetically under control_conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response ! Furthermore , conditioned_reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level , and several types of behavioral changes probably related_to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observed . If , for_instance , such a change is produced by one or a_few insulin comas or electroshocks , previously inhibited conditioned_reactions reappear . However , if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished .</context>

Since marginal_costs rise when the wage rate rises , the profit_maximizing price also rises when the public limit price is elevated , and is likely to remain well above the latter . The entry limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic competition , but unless general inflation permits profit_margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy , we might expect the public limit price to approach the entry limit price . The foreign entry limit price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage rates do not enter foreign costs directly .</context>
