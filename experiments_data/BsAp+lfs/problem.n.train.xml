Aside_from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate <head>problem</head> in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community .

This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental <head>problem</head> Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek speaking ones . They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history .

The release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or_else absolutely impossible ; and the motion toward it brings disaster . This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ; it is particularly the artist ( Tonio_Kro^ger , Aschenbach , Leverku^hn ) who suffers from it . The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the <head>problem</head> of the `` breakthrough '' in the realm of art . Again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child .

This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for_example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry . We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes . This <head>problem</head> of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis . Since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it . First , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist .

      <context> Hence the prime issue , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature .

We must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ?

      <context> But still , the proposition is worth examination . It is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some code of `` right '' and `` wrong '' . I do not know that this is true ; both Flugel and Ranyard_West deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologians as Niebuhr and Buber . It forms the core of many , perhaps most , <head>problems</head> of psychotherapy . I am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary_study in the development of conscience - most_of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life , or , for the theologians of_course , to the influence of religion . Still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one 's ideas of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic_books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of_this influence . Probably the most important thing to focus_on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available .</context>

In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such_as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs . The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated . Perhaps a clue to these and related <head>problems</head> lies_in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity . A state of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not_only an increase in the parasympathetic reactivity this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli , but leads also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus acting sympathetically under control_conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response ! Furthermore , conditioned_reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level , and several types of behavioral changes probably related_to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observed .

In_view_of the important role which emotional_disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes .</context>

Facilitatory processes take_place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways . Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges .

For_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement . The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the <head>problems</head> facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies . We should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call_for effort as_well_as enthusiasm . Above_all , we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible_for their fates .</context>

      <context> The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools . According_to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit . The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the <head>problem</head> . Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced . The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination . But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple .</context>

If , as I suspect , the <head>problem</head> is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems .

And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble . Today , according_to land economist Homer_Hoyt , shopping_centers and their associated parking_lots cover some 46000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land_area in all the nation 's Central Business_Districts put together . The downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety , both within its gates and across the street , where other department_stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making_up_her_mind .</context>

      <context> As it affects the city 's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . Subways improved land values without taking_away land ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by_a_long_shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed . Downtown Los_Angeles is already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking_lot and garage - one of those preposterous `` if '' statistics has already come to pass . The freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access <head>problem</head> , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , isolating boundary .

Less ambitious freeway plans may be more successful - especially when the roadways and interchanges are raised , allowing_for cross access at many points and providing parking_areas below the ramp . Meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central_city some of its industrial dominance .</context>
