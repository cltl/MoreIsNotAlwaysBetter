      <context> Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act . To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition . But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating . The frequently postulated antique <head>worry</head> that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave_rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize . It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter_solstice . This and other fears of the solar_system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic_system and its built-in concept of periodicity and_then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions . This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .</context>

      <context> Arlen , too , worked_on other projects at_the_same_time with old friend Ted_Koehler . Besides doing a single song , `` When_the_Sun_Comes_Out '' , they worked_on the ambitious Americanegro_Suite , for voices and piano , as_well_as songs for films . The Americanegro_Suite is in_a_sense an extension of the Cotton_Club songs in_that it is a collection of Negro songs , not for a night_club , but for the concert stage . The work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight bar musical strain to which Koehler set the words `` There 'll be no more work / There 'll be no more <head>worry</head> '' , matching the spiritual feeling of the jot . This grew_into the song `` Big_Time_Comin '' ' . By September 1940 the suite had developed into a collection of six songs , `` four spirituals , a dream , and a lullaby '' . The Negro composer Hall_Johnson studied the Americanegro_Suite and said of it , `` Of all the many songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a Negroid idiom in both words and music , these six songs by Harold_Arlen and Ted_Koehler easily stand far out above the rest .</context>
