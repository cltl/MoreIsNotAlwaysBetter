      <context> Marshall_Formby of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas_Highway_Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections . Under Formby 's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant_governor , speaker of the House , attorney_general and chief_justice of the Texas_Supreme_Court . State representatives decided Thursday against taking_a_poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State_Affairs_Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a <head>U.S.</head> senator . Rep._Wesley_Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West_Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman_Bill_Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said .</context>

      <context> Obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated . Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses - architecture versus interior_design - let us examine the educational needs of the interior_designer . To_begin_with , what is an interior_designer ? `` The_Dictionary_of_Occupational_Titles '' published by the <head>U._S.</head> Department_of_Labor describes him as_follows : `` Designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , clubs , ships , theaters , as_well_as set_decorations for motion_picture arts and television . Makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor_coverings , wall decorations , and determines color_schemes .

The interior_designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance .</context>

Brevet_Major_General_George_Armstrong_Custer was the regiment 's first permanent commander and , like such generals as George_S._Patton and Terry_de_la_Mesa_Allen in their rise to military prominence , Custer was a believer in blood_and_guts warfare .

      <context> If we look_at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev 's nightmarish worries - or , at_least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage . The other charge was that America 's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years . The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world_affairs can quarrel with it . The argument was typically advanced in_terms_of <head>U._S.</head> `` prestige '' . Prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ; and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading . Prestige is a measure of how other people think_of you , well or ill . But contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake .</context>

      <context> The thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it . The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United_States is weaker than the Soviet_Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead . This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human_beings typically do - namely , by taking steps to end_up on what appears to be the winning side . To the extent , then , that declining <head>U._S.</head> prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern . Still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet_Union and ourselves . Here I do not speak_of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power - of influence , if you will - about which the relevant questions are : Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ?</context>

      <context> One was demonstrably false ; the other , for_the_most_part , true . The first was that America had become - or was in_danger_of becoming - a second-rate military power . I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention . You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment - I certainly do - but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United_States not_only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of <head>U._S.</head> - Soviet relations for the foreseeable future . I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr._Jameson_Campaigne has done it well in his new book American_Might_and_Soviet_Myth . Suppose , he says , that the tables_were_turned , and we were in the Soviets ' position : `` There would be more_than 2000 modern Soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean . Overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a_few hundred miles of our coast .</context>
