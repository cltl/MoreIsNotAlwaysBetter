      <context> He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day_schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . There was no <head>debate</head> as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . It would authorize the Texas_Education_Agency to establish county-wide day_schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of_age to attend the day_schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas_School_for_the_Deaf here . Operating_budget for the day_schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El_Paso would be $ 451500 , which would be a savings of $ 157460 yearly after the first year 's capital outlay of $ 88000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate . The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day_school in Dallas_County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school .</context>

While details are still be to worked_out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home_folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry 's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected . `` We 're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse_race betting '' , said Ratcliff . `` But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most_of them would oppose it also .</context>

      <context> But is that not like going_to a chemistry_laboratory and blindly pouring_out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder_drug inevitably to result ? What of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? Is there some magic in it that assures results ? When Peter_B._Kyne ( Pride_of_Palomar , 43 ) informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike for the Japanese , did the heated <head>debates</head> of the Californians settle the truth or falsity of the proposition ? The Leopard 's_Spots came from the pen of Thomas_Dixon in 1902 , and in_this he announced an `` unchangeable '' law . If a child had a single drop of Negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3000 years . That doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ?</context>

      <context> For several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship . The stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress .

Research , on_the_other_hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers . Helen_Deutsch informed us ( The_Psychology_of_Women , Vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many . Will mere debate on that proposition , even_though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ?</context>
