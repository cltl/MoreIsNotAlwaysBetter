      <context> The Fulton_County_Grand_Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary_election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took_place . The jury further said in term end presentments that the City_Executive_Committee , which had over-all <head>charge</head> of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City_of_Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . The September October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior_Court_Judge_Durwood_Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate_Ivan_Allen_Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of_this city '' . The jury said it did find that many_of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' .</context>

      <context> A hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is `` Faith_of_our_Fathers '' , which glories in England 's ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims : `` Faith of our Fathers : Mary 's prayers / Shall win our country back to thee '' . The English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty_Martyrs and Cardinal_Newman will soon be canonized . Because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , English Catholics have always strongly resented the <head>charge</head> of being `` English '' . I have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in_the_air . For_example , a writer in a recent number of The_Queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un English '' ' . In this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics , priests and laity , in England , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics , especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good .</context>

The association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic_forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades . Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles . In the late 1700 's Beccaria and van_Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic <head>charge</head> through it . Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden_jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch spring steel making its ends magnetic . The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise . The experiments of Romagnosi and_others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause and effect relationship between these two primary forces .</context>

      <context> This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power . I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be . And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free_world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . In the recent political_campaign two <head>charges</head> were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus . One was demonstrably false ; the other , for_the_most_part , true . The first was that America had become - or was in_danger_of becoming - a second-rate military power .

The other <head>charge</head> was that America 's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years . The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world_affairs can quarrel with it . The argument was typically advanced in_terms_of U._S. `` prestige '' .
