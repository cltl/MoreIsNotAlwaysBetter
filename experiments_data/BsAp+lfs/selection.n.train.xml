      <context> The appointment was announced at a news_conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw 's staff - Jerry_Williams and Charlie_Gauer . Williams is a defensive coach . Gauer works with the ends . The <head>selection</head> had been expected . Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm_Van_Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching_job with the Minnesota_Vikings , the newest National_Football_League entry . Van_Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player .</context>

      <context> There are three principal feed_bunk types for dairy and beef_cattle : ( 1 ) Fence-line bunks - cattle eat from one side while feed is put_in from the opposite side of the fence by self unloading wagons ; ( 2 ) Mechanized bunks - they sit within the feed_lot , are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface ; ( 3 ) Special bunks - as discussed here , they permit cattle to eat from all sides . Feed is put_in with an elevator . Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed_bunk . The <head>selection</head> of materials depends_on skills of available labor for installation , cost of materials available locally , and your own preference . No one material is best for all situations . Selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem . Animals eat only from one side , so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk .</context>

With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today - and it will be tougher in_the future . Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due_to the demanding combination of qualifications called_for by this type of management work . The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties .</context>

      <context> An aggressor would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity in a target population . A solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized . It must be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent . There is a broad spectrum of organisms from which <head>selection</head> for a specified military purpose might be made . An enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism , a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality . It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such_as antibiotic resistant strains . Mutants may also be developed with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in identification .</context>

      <context> Fourth , the two indicators are for_the_most_part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center . The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood . Onsets , Completions , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile . It may be assumed that differences in ratings due_to <head>selection</head> of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according_to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body . Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence . It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as_well_as Hand , it seems to be the method_of_choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood .</context>

      <context> Equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle_class neighborhoods . Individual differences in maturation and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement . Therefore , third grade children were chosen as subjects for this study . For purposes of sample <head>selection</head> only ( individual tests were given later ) we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third grade population in each school_system . The subjects for this study were randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution , one-third as underachievers , one-third medium , and one-third over-achievers . Children whose reading scores were at_least one standard_deviation below the regression_line of each total third grade school population were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection . Over-achievers were at_least one standard_deviation above the regression_line in their school_system .</context>

      <context> Ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon . This procedure was repeated one day a month for four months . The batting_average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three . The president of the firm , calculating expenses alone , felt his costs had dropped one-half while success in <head>selection</head> had improved over one_hundred per_cent . The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers . They were , in_a_sense , `` tried_out '' in realistic situations . From the point_of_view of the applicants , less time was wasted in being evaluated - and they got a meal out of it as_well_as some insights into their performances .</context>

      <context> An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal_systems , including some of the more unusual types . By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no_more of the range of possibilities in tone_systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour_languages . This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone . Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative <head>selection</head> of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist . Papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work . The second need is better field techniques . The great majority of present-day linguists fall_into one or more of a number of overlapping types : those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed , those who are personally scared of tone and tone_languages generally , those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter .</context>

      <context> Even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt 's motel has been relatively painless ; the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every_year . What hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing , especially in those cities where public_transit is feeble . Some retailing , of_course , always spreads with the population - grocery_stores , drugstores , local haberdasheries and dress_shops , candy_stores and the_like . But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago - a new bedroom_set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior - the family set_off for the downtown department_store , where the <head>selection</head> would be greatest . Department_stores congregated in the `` one_hundred per_cent location '' , where all the transit_lines converged . These stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more_and_more dry_goods . If the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar_volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put_in the bank .</context>
