      <context> Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses - architecture versus interior_design - let us examine the educational needs of the interior_designer . To_begin_with , what is an interior_designer ? `` The_Dictionary_of_Occupational_Titles '' published by the U._S. Department_of_Labor describes him as_follows : `` Designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , <head>hotels</head> , clubs , ships , theaters , as_well_as set_decorations for motion_picture arts and television . Makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor_coverings , wall decorations , and determines color_schemes . Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval . Makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows_through to completion of project `` .</context>

      <context> In_fact , O_'_Connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $ 2500 diamond stickpin . There was a brief interruption while one of O_'_Banion 's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip . Then O_'_Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds . This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more_or_less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek_by_jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown <head>hotels</head> '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928_-_29 '' . However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever . O_'_Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal .</context>

      <context> The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive - and the rate_of_attrition due_to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high . It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired - and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed . Roleplaying was offered as a solution - and the procedure worked as_follows : all candidates were invited to a <head>hotel</head> conference_room , where the president explained the difficulty he had , and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work_out . In_place_of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires , checking their references , interviewing them , asking them to be tried_out , he told them he would prefer to test them . Each person was to enter the testing_room , carrying a suitcase of samples . Each salesman was to read a sheet containing a description of the product .</context>

      <context> Since that time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad_station at the Depot and shops at the Center back to the town_clerk 's office and drugstore at the Village . After being located for some years in the Village at the Equinox_Pharmacy under the supervision of Mrs._Harry_Mercier , it is presently located in the Hill_and_Dale_Shop , Manchester_Center . The first known telephone_line in Manchester was established in July 1883 between Burr and Manley 's store at Manchester_Depot and the Kent_and_Root_Marble_Company in South_Dorset . This was extended the following year to include the railroad_station agent 's office and Thayer 's <head>Hotel</head> at Factory_Point . In November 1887 a line connecting several dwelling_houses in Dorset was extended to Manchester_Depot . Telephone_wires from Louis_Dufresne 's house in East_Manchester to the Dufresne lumber job near Bourn_Pond were up about 1895 . Eber_L._Taylor of Manchester_Depot recorded the setting of phone poles in East_Dorset and Barnumville in his diary for 1906 .</context>

      <context> It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts ' Route_128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements , or from the exploitation of patents which grant at_least a partial monopoly . While the factories were always the center of the labor_market , they were often on the city 's periphery . In spreading the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities . Even the loss of <head>hotel</head> business to the outskirt 's motel has been relatively painless ; the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every_year . What hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing , especially in those cities where public_transit is feeble . Some retailing , of_course , always spreads with the population - grocery_stores , drugstores , local haberdasheries and dress_shops , candy_stores and the_like . But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago - a new bedroom_set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior - the family set_off for the downtown department_store , where the selection would be greatest .</context>
