In her sophomore year she had started going_steady with Bobby_Joe , who was a <head>football_player</head> , Future_Homemakers sweetheart , and president of Future_Farmers . It was easy to see that they were made_for each other , and they knew what they wanted . Bobby_Joe would be a senior this year , and he planned to graduate .
