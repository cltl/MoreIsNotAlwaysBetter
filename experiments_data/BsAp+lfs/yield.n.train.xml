      <context> The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great_Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War_of_1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go_to Red_River where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest_Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire . The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . It was the low <head>yield</head> of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward . When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river . Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort_Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland . The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort_Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food .</context>

      <context> When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O_'_Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $ 20000 a month . In six months O_'_Banion had boosted the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb . These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; once_again O_'_Banion 's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill_will . The revenue from O_'_Banion 's Cicero territory went_up still higher , until the <head>yield</head> was more_than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago 's South and West_Sides . But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate . At_last , even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O_'_Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in_return for one from his Cicero beer concession . O_'_Banion 's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .</context>

      <context> Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85 ` in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation_energy and the effect of light intensity .

These estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon_tetrachloride at 65 ` is of the order_of_magnitude of unity .

Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical_exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon_tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate .</context>

      <context> The thermal exchange of chlorine between * * f and liquid * * f is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180 ` and above .
