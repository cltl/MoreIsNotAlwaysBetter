      <context> The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit_world of the entities which previously populated it . In carrying_out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit . The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support . Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in <head>space</head> and time . When , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality . In doing so science has unquestionably cleared_up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions . There have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful .</context>

If the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense_of_touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in_independence_of visual representations , at_least in regard_to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on_the_part_of unaided touch is denied by the authors . How , then , do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this ? The authors set_about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient 's ability , tactually , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate objects in <head>space</head> , with his eyes closed ( or turned_away from the object concerned ) . Quite naturally , they make the investigation , first , by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at_all and_then , later , by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to . When the patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at_all , the following striking results occurred .</context>

      <context> The necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense_of_touch , as_such . We do not arrive_at spatial images by means of the sense_of_touch by itself . ( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual_sensation only by way of visual representations ; that_is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual_space '' . The underlying assumption , of_course , is that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully dependable way , to locate objects in <head>space</head> beyond us , the other senses being decidedly inferior , if_not totally inadequate , in this regard . This is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel . Therefore , if the sense_of_touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary . The force of the authors ' analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , I believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered .</context>

      <context> Cubism , in its 1911 - 1912 phase ( which the_French , with justice , call `` hermetic '' ) was on the verge of abstract_art . It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation . If they opted_for illusion , it could only be illusion per_se - an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual objects . If , on_the_other_hand , they opted_for representation , it had to be representation per_se - representation as image pure_and_simple , without connotations ( at_least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional <head>space</head> in which the objects represented originally existed . It was the collage that made the terms of_this dilemma clear : the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for_the_first_time , mutually_exclusive alternatives . In_the_end , Picasso and Braque plumped_for the representational , and it would seem they did so deliberately . ( This provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality '' . )</context>

      <context> Rather than being deceived , the eye is puzzled ; instead of seeing objects in <head>space</head> , it sees nothing more than - a picture . Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's_length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; the granular texture thus created likewise called_attention_to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing .</context>

      <context> Synthetic_Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this was the_point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it . But even before that , Picasso had glimpsed and entered , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him . It was as though , in_that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all_the_way back - or forward - to literal three-dimensionality . This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in_general ) literally into the literal <head>space</head> in_front of the picture_plane . Some time in 1912 , Picasso cut_out and folded a piece_of_paper in the shape of a guitar ; to this he glued and fitted other pieces_of_paper and four taut strings , thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture_plane .

      <context> Literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerangs : the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before . Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it , the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as_well_as start his picture . The actual surface becomes both ground and background , and it turns_out - suddenly and paradoxically - that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in_front of , upon , the surface . In their very first collages , Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain_of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust_out into real , bas-relief <head>space</head> - or to be about to do so - while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in , or flat upon , the surface . And the surface is driven back , in its very surfaceness , only by this contrast . In the upper center of Braque 's first collage , Fruit_Dish ( in Douglas_Cooper 's collection ) , a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture_plane . The trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no_longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses , but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing_paper and establish depth on top of_it .</context>
