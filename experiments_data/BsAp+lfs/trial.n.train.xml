      <context> He had a round , frank Irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in_place even when he was pumping bullets into someone 's body . He carried three guns - one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket - and was equally lethal with both hands . He killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately . The police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to <head>trial</head> for one of them . Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol . He was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths . He had no apparent comprehension of morality ; he divided humanity into `` right guys '' and `` wrong guys '' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under .</context>

      <context> She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man . Women themselves have come to look_upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld . She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done . One who invites such <head>trials</head> of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger . In any case but the last , such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual ; the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining . And , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature '' . Henrietta was discovering in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition .</context>

A network of sampling_stations had been set_up on shore . These were located at the homes of Government employees , in Government_Offices , buildings and reservations within the <head>trial</head> area . A rough attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first , ninth , and fifteenth floors of a Government_office building . All samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours . In this instance , there was a dosage of 562 during the first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four hour period , a four-fold increase .</context>

      <context> From March 3 to May 1 , 1949 , the patient was maintained on dexamethasone , 3 to 6 mg. daily . In May 1959 , prednisone , 30 mg. daily , replaced the dexamethasone . Muscle weakness did not improve , and the patient needed first a cane , then crutches . In_spite of normal thyroid function tests , a <head>trial</head> of propylthiouracil , 400 mg. daily for one week , was given but served only to intensify muscle weakness . Repeated attempts to withdraw steroids entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted , as_well_as fever , malaise , anorexia , anxiety , and an exacerbation of the anemia . These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism . Severe back pain in June , 1959 , prompted a third hospital admission .</context>

      <context> `` Success '' and `` failure '' are just convenient labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk_about binomial trials in_general . These words are more expressive than labels like `` A '' and `` not - A '' . It is natural from the marksman 's viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success , but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse . The word `` binomial '' means `` of two names '' or `` of two terms '' , and both usages apply in our work : the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial <head>trial</head> , and the second to the terms p and * * f that represent the probabilities of `` success '' and `` failure '' . Sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial , we group these outcomes into two classes , as in the example of the die , where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes `` ace '' and `` not ace '' . We classify mice as `` straight haired '' or `` wavy haired '' , but a hairless mouse appears .
