      <context> Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture . If you are not well acquainted_with the area in which you wish_to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy . Discussed below are some of the main things to look_for when you select a part-time farm . Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other <head>employment</head> opportunities . Then if you change jobs you won n't necessarily have_to sell the farm . The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable . Obviously the farm should be on an all weather road .</context>

      <context> Adult_education courses , work-study_programs of various sorts - these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth . In_general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high_school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next . If the student drops_out of high_school , the break with the school is even more complete . When there is <head>employment</head> opportunity for youth , this arrangement - or lack of arrangement - works_out quite well . Indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work . Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one . I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high_school and was highly successful in the business which he entered .</context>

      <context> First_and_foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic_program for graduation . Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more_than half the student 's time in those years ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought_to begin earlier . Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the <head>employment</head> opportunities in the general locality . This last point is important because if high_school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational_program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears . Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in_fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter . Those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather_than specific skills ought_to bear_in_mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience .</context>

      <context> Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78_th_Congress in 1943 passed P._L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure . Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative <head>employment</head> to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services .</context>

An extension of this program into the other distressed areas should be undertaken .
