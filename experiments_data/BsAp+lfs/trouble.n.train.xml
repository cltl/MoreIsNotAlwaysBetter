      <context> Ordinary Carey_Williams , armed with a pistol , stood_by at the polls to insure order . `` This was the coolest , calmest election I ever saw '' , Colquitt_Policeman_Tom_Williams said . `` Being at the polls was just like being at church .

It was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone_calls and veiled threats of violence . The former county school_superintendent , George_P._Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school_board .</context>

      <context> Larkin has an answer to all that . The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas , for_example , will provide needed space for the extra television_sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids .

      <context> Producer_John_Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season 's opener at Matunuck in Jean_Kerr 's `` King_of_Hearts '' . The dialogue is sharp , witty and candid - typical `` do n't eat the daisies '' material - which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays , and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience liked it . The story is of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts a 10 - year old to provide him with fresh idea material . This is when his <head>troubles</head> begin , not_to_mention a fledgling artist who he hires , and who turns_out to have ideas of his own , with particular respect_to the hero 's sweetheart secretary . John_Heffernan , playing Larry_Larkin , the cartoonist , carries_the_show in marvelous fashion . His portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless . This may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of David_Hedison , Providence 's contribution to Hollywood , who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th_Century-Fox .</context>

Mr._Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now famous Weider_Push-Pull_Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . So right_away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull_Super-Set consisting_of the wide grip Straight-Arm_Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull_Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib_cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar Bench_Press which specifically works_on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids .</context>

      <context> The ship 's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North_Pole .

The <head>trouble</head> was at_least partly Juet 's doing . For weeks he had been saying that Hudson 's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd . The great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason . A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther .</context>

      <context> This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used . This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power . I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be . And I suggest further that the main cause of the <head>trouble</head> we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free_world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . In the recent political_campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus . One was demonstrably false ; the other , for_the_most_part , true . The first was that America had become - or was in_danger_of becoming - a second-rate military power .</context>

      <context> A binomial experiment can produce random_variables other_than the number of successes . For_example , the marksman gets 5 shots , but we take his score to be the number of shots before his first bull's-eye , that_is , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( or 5 , if he gets no bull's-eye ) . Thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes , and the random_variable is not the number of successes . The constancy of p and the independence are the conditions most likely to give <head>trouble</head> in_practice . Obviously , very slight changes in p do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference . ( For_instance , see Example 2 of Section 5 - 5 , on red cards in hands of 5 . ) On_the_other_hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical_phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a baseline for comparative purposes ; that_is , we may discuss the phenomenon in_terms_of its departures from the binomial model .</context>

In I know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; in one thing I know it will usually be on the predicator know .

      <context> As the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated_by either party could fairly administer elections . The P.D.I. and later the Popular_Movement protected the Istiqlal 's `` privileged position '' until the fall of Balafrej , and_then the Istiqlal used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the pro U.N.F.P. tendencies of the Ibrahim government . The bulk of the preparation had , of_course , proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry_of_the_Interior , whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics . Apart from some areas of recurring <head>trouble</head> , like Bani_Mellal , where inexperienced officials had been appointed , there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process . Centrally , however , the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage . The King decided to remove Ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a non-party Council_of_Government under his personal direction . Although the monarch had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance , his action was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor .</context>
