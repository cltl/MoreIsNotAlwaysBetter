      <context> The slave is owner , And ever was . Pay him '' ! It is the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist . It ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the <head>transaction</head> having been put_away long_ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) . Like Pilate , they had washed_their_hands . But can one , really ? Can God be mocked , ever , in_the_long_run ?</context>

      <context> Other factors increasing operating_costs include the higher unit_cost of each flying hour , up 11 % in two years , and of each steaming hour , up 15 % . In total , these increases in operating_costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such_as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed_Forces . In the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 ) . This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying_out certain <head>transactions</head> involving real_property unless they come into agreement with the Committees_on_Armed_Services of the Senate and the House_of_Representatives . As I have stated previously , the Attorney_General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles . Accordingly , if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise . Basic long line communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army , Air_Force , and Federal_Aviation_Agency .</context>
