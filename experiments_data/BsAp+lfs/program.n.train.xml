      <context> The episode in which Sancho_Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island '' is one of the best in the film . True , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a_bit wearisome in the first_half , before Don_Quixote goes to the duke 's court . But strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old_boy .

About that same time John_Crosby 's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing_space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do .

      <context> Television has yet to work_out a living_arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family . There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago style jazz in prime evening time , for_example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary . At_least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' , presented on NBC - TV Nov. 26 . The <head>program</head> came_out of the NBC Special Projects department , and was slotted in the Du_Pont_Show of the Week series . Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines . If so , it might be worth_while to assign a future jazz show to a different department - one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut_down on the number of performers and give them a_little room to display their talents . As_a_matter_of_fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results .</context>

In it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in_general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously .

In carrying_out this <head>program</head> science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit . The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support .

When , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality .</context>

Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain_stores have insisted on high_quality - and the customer seems to have caught_on . If you are up_against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term <head>program</head> for researching and strengthening your market position ? If private brand competition has n't been felt in your product field as_yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? Display merchandising , backed by pre selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties . It has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program .</context>

No_doubt many_of the citizens of the Third_Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today . The Final_Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others .

The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' .

Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states .</context>

      <context> The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community .

      <context> In my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational_programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city . Ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest . An excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high_school is the Dunbar_Vocational_High_School in Chicago . Located in a bad slum_area now undergoing redevelopment , this school and its <head>program</head> are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students . Hardly_a window has been broken since Dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum_areas ) .

      <context> I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high_school and was highly successful in the business which he entered . He may or may_not be `` better_off '' than his classmate who went_on to a college and professional school . But in the next decades the nation needs_to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent . In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , I shall discuss the importance of arranging a <head>program</head> for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high_school where he is found . In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation . High motivation towards higher_education must start early enough so_that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at_least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work . Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools .</context>

During the next five years liberal leaders in the United_States sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment - and the bitterest irony - enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : the atom_bomb . In 1952 , it will be remembered , the G._O._P. without positive <head>program</head> campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly .

Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ; in interstellar gas , concentrations as low as * * f molecules / * * f may be sufficient , as compared to the * * f hydrogen_atoms * * f required for detection of the 21 - cm line . High sensitivity in radio_telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver ; therefore , only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio_spectra of these molecules feasible . To secure precise measurements of these frequencies , a research <head>program</head> in free_radical microwave spectroscopy has been started . Since conventional methods are insensitive at the low_frequencies of these molecular transitions , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead . This involves the application of a strong magnetic_field to the radical vapor , which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range , where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity . The first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the OH radical .</context>

Success in observing these spectral lines has so_far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ; extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported . Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals . The Bureau is pursuing an active <head>program</head> to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 * * f . The efforts and accomplishments fall_into three main categories : absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors , and helium 4 vapor-pressure measurements ( see p. 144 ) . An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the thermometric fluid , to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 * * f . Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute_temperature measurement , and may be used as_an_alternative to the gas_thermometer .</context>

      <context> It should be American policy not_only to encourage effective land_reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society .

It should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone . Land_reform programs need to be supplemented with <head>programs</head> for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture .

      <context> Another great danger is that the emerging middle_class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political_leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism . The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West . Particularly when based upon a single dominant party , governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest . Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development <head>programs</head> , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead rigid and inflexible in their policies . American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes . It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies . We have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways .</context>

      <context> A third aspect , and probably the one open_to most controversy , is the results of the election . The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested parties , including the government itself , were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections . The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics . Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government <head>program</head> and official address since independence . They were stressed in the speeches of Si_Mubarak_Bekkai when the first Council_of_Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council . King_Muhammad /5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections on May_Day , 1957 . There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister_of_the_Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less_than enthusiastic .</context>

      <context> Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . Some vocational training_schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes_Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state administered <head>programs</head> of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home_economics . Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . The George-Barden_Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in_addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith_Act . The Health_Amendment_Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical_nurse training .</context>

      <context> The Title 8 , program of the National_Defense_Education_Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools . By 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states . They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas . An extension of this <head>program</head> into the other distressed areas should be undertaken . Some of this trend toward area vocational_schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry . The major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of pre employment training for a large_number of semi-skilled machine operators . A_few key skilled_workers experienced in the company 's type of work usually must be brought_in with the plant manager , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere .</context>

      <context> Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown . Raymond_Vernon reports that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the lot next_door . If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened_away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway <head>program</head> . And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble . Today , according_to land economist Homer_Hoyt , shopping_centers and their associated parking_lots cover some 46000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land_area in all the nation 's Central Business_Districts put together . The downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety , both within its gates and across the street , where other department_stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making_up_her_mind .</context>
