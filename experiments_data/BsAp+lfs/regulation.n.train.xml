      <context> A year later in Albany , N._Y. , a Roman_Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned_Parenthood_Association . Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious_belief and conscience . These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue . It has flared_up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth prevention <head>regulations</head> in municipal hospitals and health and family welfare agencies . It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries . Where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment . The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation .</context>

      <context> All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks . Even the officer in_charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is restrained by monitoring . This is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility . The commands are specified by the military <head>regulations</head> ; are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound ; and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade_ground . This monitoring is necessary because , on a parade_ground , everyone can hear too_much , and without monitoring a confused social_event would develop . With troops dispersed on fields_of_battle rather than on the parade_ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication . Years ago this was true , but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too_much is heard .</context>

      <context> And ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower_rank . These assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and_so_on until there are six levels of personnel . The number of people acting_as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of * * f 55987 men . This organizational network would be of no avail if there were no <head>regulations</head> pertaining to the types of message sent . Of types of message listed in Table 1 , commands and statements are the only ones sent through the vertical network shown in Figure 3 . A further regulation is that commands always go_down , unaccompanied by statements , and statements always go_up , unaccompanied by commands . Questions and , particularly , exclamations are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor .</context>

Furthermore , the network in Figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the_like are interlaced .</context>

They have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , I believe , in pointing_out Faulkner 's independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the Southern tradition . Faulkner 's is not the mind of the apologist which Mr._O'_Donnell implies that it is . He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions - or possibly the <head>regulations</head> - governing his tenure in the post_office at Oxford , Mississippi , thirty-five years ago . That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of_course , that he is steeped in them , in_fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books . It is to say rather , I believe , that he has brought_to_bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind - the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique . He has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern .</context>

While the <head>regulations</head> formerly required that the hearing_officer 's report be placed in the registrant 's file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952 . Moreover , the hearing_officer 's report is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney_General and , of_course , is not the recommendation of the Department .
