The former county school_superintendent , George_P._Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school_board .

Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election .</context>

      <context> A_couple_of the males made good comedy , too - Jim_Hutton and Frank_Gorshin . The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette_Mimieux , but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , I suppose this was the attitude the part called_for . I must say , however , that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it . To anyone who remembers Newport at its less_than maximum <head>violence</head> , this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz_Festival ought to prove entertaining .

      <context> If anti-Semitism was on_trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as_well_as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? The infamous Wansee_Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put_to_death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich_Minister_of_the_Interior , the State_Secretary in_charge of the Four_Year_Plan , the Reich_Minister_of_Justice , the Under_Secretary_of_Foreign_Affairs . The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government . Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final_Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living_space through <head>violence</head> , economic_strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . In_other_words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted_on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder . This , in_fact , it turned_out to be . Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed_forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of_it , conscious accomplices of Hitler 's crimes ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually .</context>

Unlike the Sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution . He was also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 O_'_Banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state : `` I always deliver my borough as per requirements '' .

      <context> The `` chase '' as a standard film device probably dates_from The_Great_Train_Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device . The chase in itself is a narrative ; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting - both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not_only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for <head>violence</head> ; these films and these sequences are also seeking_out - instinctively or by_design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative . There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . The man was D.W._Griffith . When he came to the movies - more_or_less by accident - they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes .</context>

      <context> In the American `` hardboiled '' detective_story of the ' 20 s and ' 30 s , the spirit of the mad genius from Baker_Street lives on . Like Holmes , the American private_eye rejects the social conventions of his time . But unlike Holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt . Surrounded by crime and <head>violence</head> everywhere , the `` hardboiled '' private_eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation . His alienation is far more acute than Holmes ' ; he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast . With Rex_Stout 's Nero_Wolfe , alienation is represented on a purely physical plane . Wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house , and spends most_of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids .</context>

      <context> The private_eye is therefore a moral man ; but his morality rests upon that of his society . The basic premise of all mystery_stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal . Unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good . As capitalism in the 20_th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and <head>violence</head> for its survival , the private_detective is placed in a serious dilemma . If he is good , he may not be legal ; if he is legal , he may not be good . It is the gradual unfolding and deepening of_this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery_story . With the advent of Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle 's Sherlock_Holmes , the development of the modern private_detective begins .</context>

      <context> During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration_of_Independence . During the Brown trial , however , the state 's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence_Daily_Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not_only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal_governments . The Providence_Daily_Journal answered the Daily_Post by stating that the raid of John_Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of <head>violence</head> and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican_Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' . The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history . While the Daily_Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily_Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket_Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men . Editor_Foss stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no_doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' .</context>

Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas , occasioned by the <head>violence</head> and brutality of those who were intent_on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call_for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice . Resolved that the anti slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action . Resolved , that we find in this fearful tragedy at Harper_'s_Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible . On the morning following the Pratt_Hall meeting the editor of the Providence_Daily_Journal wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes , it could have been avoided completely .</context>
