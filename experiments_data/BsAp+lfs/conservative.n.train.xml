      <context> Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites . Most_of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure . Many Northerners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly . The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern <head>conservatives</head> . But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . They believe that if the South had been let_alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America . As_it_is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in_spite_of its high standard_of_living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter .</context>

      <context> Northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil_rights and of integration . They have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare_state . And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons . The name presumably derives from the French royal_house which never learned and never forgot ; since Bourbon whiskey , though of Kentucky origin , is at_least as much favored by liberals in the North as by <head>conservatives</head> in the South . The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North . The race_problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive . It is these other differences between North and South - other , that_is , than those which concern discrimination or social_welfare - which I chiefly discuss herein .</context>

      <context> It has moved_on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused . Obviously there has been no agreement on what American conservatism is , or rather , what it should be . For it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle began . I saw a piece the other day assailing William_Buckley , author of Man_And_God_At_Yale and publisher of the National_Review , as no <head>conservative</head> at_all , but an old liberal . I would agree with this view . But I 'm not here to define conservatism . What I am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle - a struggle that amounts to self redefinition - to see if we can predict its future course .</context>
