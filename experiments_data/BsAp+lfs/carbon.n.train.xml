      <context> Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute_temperature measurement , and may be used as_an_alternative to the gas_thermometer . When values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium 4 vapor_pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found . This result is preliminary , and work is continuing . <head>Carbon</head> resistors and impurity doped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region . Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 * * f and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1 3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor_pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most_of the liquid helium . Preliminary calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 * * f at every 0.1 * * f . The estimated standard_deviations of the data for two of the resistors were 1 millidegree ; and for the third resistor , 3.3 millidegrees .</context>

      <context> Argon was also blown at low velocities ( mass flow_rate **f ) through a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air . The anode consisted_of a 1/2 inch diameter porous graphite plug , 1/4 inch long . The graphite was National_Carbon_NC 60 , which has a porosity of 50 % and an average pore size of 30 This small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode . The anode plug ( Figure 2 ) was inserted into a <head>carbon</head> anode holder . A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas . It was exposed to a high velocity gas_jet . A plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts .</context>

      <context> Three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature . Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3 . In this design the anode holder is water_cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the coolant . To reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the region of the arc , a <head>carbon</head> shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder . In_addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum_foil to reduce radiation . Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water_cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account_for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug . The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator .</context>

      <context> This calculation results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross_section whereas in_reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures . The upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple shown in figure 2 was **f . The **f values are listed in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages . Simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the <head>carbon</head> anode holder as indicated on figure 2 . Some of these temperatures are plotted in figure 4 . They showed no marked dependence on the flow_rate within the accuracy of these measurements . Thus , the dotted line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates .</context>

      <context> It appears possible to set a lower_limit of about * * f for the activation_energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon_tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form * * f radical . The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions . Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon_tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data . It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical_reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation_energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free_radicals , as_well_as information on the heat_of_dissociation of the <head>carbon</head> halogen bond . The reaction of chlorine with carbon_tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies . It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid . It should be possible to free carbon_tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine .</context>
