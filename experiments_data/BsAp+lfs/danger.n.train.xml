      <context> That Prokofieff 's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original '' than we prefer to believe . Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability . Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated . At this date , it seems probable that the name of Serge_Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History , as an effective Traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and <head>danger</head> of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ; yet was never caught_up in it - never a slave to its academic dialectics . Certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World - not his experimentations . So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them . Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances .</context>

      <context> But the Russians use gymnastics as the first_step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance . The gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection . In short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great_deal of character as_well . The addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without <head>danger</head> of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen . Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life . ( An enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days . Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries . )</context>

      <context> The architects do not believe that the education of the interior_designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round_tables , workshops or panel_discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled_down crux_of_the_matter is education . It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . The element of public <head>danger</head> which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior_designer 's training . We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior_design student as not having serious bearing on the subject . The real question that follows is - how are those four years used and what is their value as training ?</context>

      <context> This was generally reflected in the civil_laws of Christian countries . Today , the Roman_Catholic and Orthodox_Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction . The various Lambeth_Conferences , expressing the Anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken_place among Protestants generally . In 1920 , the Lambeth_Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together_with the grave <head>dangers</head> - physical , moral , and religious - thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' . Denouncing the view that the sexual_union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded_as the governing considerations of Christian marriage . One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . The Conference called_for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives .</context>

Despite Company threats , duly carried_through , to cut_off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing_nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village . They would attempt to bring supplies from St._Louis or Prairie_du_Chien at `` great expense as well as <head>danger</head> '' . At Fort_Garry some of the_Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United_States , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort_Snelling . The disasters of 1825 - 1826 caused more to leave . After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick .</context>

      <context> This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast_Survey stations in the Pacific which are equipped with seismographs . Its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami . By means of charts showing wave travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time_of_arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under_way at any spot in the Pacific . The civil and military authorities are then advised of the <head>danger</head> , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps . All_of these activities are geared to a top priority communication_system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly . Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence . On November 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka_Peninsula .</context>

      <context> It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter_solstice . This and other fears of the solar_system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic_system and its built-in concept of periodicity and_then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions . This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls . In_fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no <head>dangers</head> . There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision . A meteor could fall on San_Francisco . Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .</context>

      <context> He is , like Phillip_Marlowe , too alienated to be reliable . Finally , in The Maltese_Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam_Spade becomes the chief murder_suspect . In_order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl_friend . What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock_Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private_eye is in <head>danger</head> of turning_into his opposite . It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery_story which creates this fatal dilemma . By upholding his own personal code_of_behavior , the private_detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption . That society responds by condemning the private_eye as a threat to the status_quo , a potential criminal .</context>

      <context> They give strict interpretation to William_James ' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself '' . They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as_soon_as he contacts something new . Hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe . Despite this <head>danger</head> , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our finest tools ; they are priceless even_though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page ; they are the most valuable of commodities - and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply . So all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall_into two classes : those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others . Seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will keep the sheriff away '' . That , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval .</context>

      <context> There are also more basic problems . This is the stage at which democratic developments must take_place if the society is to become an open community of creative people . Nevertheless , impulses still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practices . Another great <head>danger</head> is that the emerging middle_class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political_leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism . The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West . Particularly when based upon a single dominant party , governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest . Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead rigid and inflexible in their policies .</context>
