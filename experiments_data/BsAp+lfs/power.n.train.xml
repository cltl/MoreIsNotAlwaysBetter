With the speed and <head>power</head> of the body beautiful he saw before him , Ol_'_Case wanted No. 7 to be not_only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder .

      <context> It is into this household , one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people , that George_Dillon enters at the beginning of the play . An unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists . By the end of the third act , the artist is dead but the body lingers on , a shell among other shells . Not altogether a successful play , `` Epitaph_for_George_Dillon '' overcomes through sheer vitality and <head>power</head> what in a lesser work might be crippling . It is awfully talky , for_instance , and not all_of the talk is terribly impressive . But it strikes sparks on_occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten .

      <context> The tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set_out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them . We marvel at their blindness for not seeing this . Yet are not we of the mid twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there is any such `` thing '' as the devil , just as bad off as they - only in a different way ? In our disbelief we think that we can no_longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental <head>power</head> which is so vividly real in_this play . We are left helpless to cope_with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false . Even Mr._Miller himself seems uncertain on this score . In a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point : `` However , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer 's many faced lieutenants .</context>

      <context> That parallelism affects his picture of man 's disobedience too ; for as it was Christ , the Word_of_God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word_of_God in_the_beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe . With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality . At the nadir of that circuit is death . `` Along with the fruit they did also fall under the <head>power</head> of death , because they did eat in disobedience ; and disobedience to God entails death . Wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that [ moment ] they were handed_over to it '' . This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a Friday , as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good_Friday ; he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath . In_any_case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead .</context>

      <context> Your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score . It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high_fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener . The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope since Feyer 's four-sided LP edition of 1958 for Angel ) , this set is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment . The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari 's melodramatic contrasts between ultra vehement brute <head>power</head> and chilly , if suave , sentimentality . And in its engineers ' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super high_fidelity '' . The home listener is overpowered , all_right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one . As with the penultimate Giselle release ( Wolff 's abridgment for RCA_Victor ) I find the cleaner , less razor edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable - but this may be the result of processing defects in my SD copies .</context>

In_addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique .

A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective <head>power</head> of the heart itself .

The latter measures the heat carried_away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow .

      <context> One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster_Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more_than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation_Of_Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic <head>power</head> of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .

The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' .

Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own <head>power</head> and in destroying that of rival organizations and states .

Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ?</context>

But though this characterization in_no_way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of_it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final_Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ?</context>

The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first_step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West . Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country . The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in_fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy .</context>

      <context> Today Sukarno 's government is heavily besieged by avowed Communists , and for all_of its `` neutralist '' pretensions , it is a firm ally of Soviet policy . Ceylon has moved from a pro Western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West . In the Middle_East , Iraq , Syria and Egypt were , a short while ago , in the Western camp . Today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West , are dependent for their military <head>power</head> on Soviet equipment and personnel ; in almost every particular follow the Kremlin 's foreign_policy line . A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve . Never_mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination : the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land_mass was under the domination and influence of the West . Today , Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging , it would seem , into the Soviet orbit .</context>

Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .

All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . In Plato 's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual <head>powers</head> . Presupposed in Plato 's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom .

      <context> Both parties and the Ministry_of_the_Interior were busily at_work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance . Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation . The general setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization . The concentration of effective <head>power</head> in Rabat leads not_only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in_addition to contributing to more meaningful elections . Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber_of_Commerce elections , which took_place three weeks before national elections . The Istiqlal sponsored U.M.C.I.A. ( L'Union_Marocaine_des_Commercants , Industrialistes_et_Artisans ) was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P. ( L'Union_National_des_Forces_Populaires ) in nearly all urban_centers . As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen , the U.M.C.I.A. was generally favored against the more progressive , labor based U.N.F.P. The newer party campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small_businessmen to support them as they had done for many years .</context>

      <context> The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price_competition , but which is so basic that its wage price policies are held in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . In_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such_as union <head>power</head> , which may be relevant in an actual situation . For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells_out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages . Part 1 , below describes this abstract model by spelling_out its assumptions . Part 2 , discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant conclusions .</context>

      <context> Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence . Related_to , but distinguishable from , nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another . Increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions . The efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions , particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of industrialization , led to a concentration of attention on the legislative <head>power</head> and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions . Law became a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking_to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms . Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no_longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed . The old way of doing things , which depended_on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no_longer adequate_to the task .</context>

      <context> The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality . It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state <head>power</head> for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action . To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy . First , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity .</context>

      <context> To light industry , the economies of being on one floor are much slighter , but efficiency_engineers usually believe_in them , and manufacturers looking_for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning_to efficiency_engineers . This movement of industry away from the central_cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe . It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities . The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities - the rubber factories in Akron , Chrysler 's Detroit plants , U._S._Steel 's Pittsburgh works - often began on these sites at_a_time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( piers ) and <head>power</head> ( river ) . The `` leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam_turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not_yet blighted . The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in selecting his plant site .

      <context> Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after_school class I was enrolled . The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young_man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot_Sands - he of the porch steps anecdotes - who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked_off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them . Like Eliot , in my fantasies , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night 's climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love .
