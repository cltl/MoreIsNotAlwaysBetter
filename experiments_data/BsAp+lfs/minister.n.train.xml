      <context> The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age . There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people . Instead , the audience can sit_back at_ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no_longer believes_in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion . A teenage girl , Abigail_Williams , is being sharply questioned by her <head>minister</head> uncle , the Reverend_Samuel_Parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings . For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air . As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community . Everyone in Salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept_up by it .</context>

      <context> The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came_out the best . There were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very_much to do as clergyman . Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public_press of mid Victorian England . There was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on B.B.C. , where comments were equally made by an Anglican parson , a Free_Church <head>minister</head> and a Catholic priest . Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television_programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen . A notable example of this was the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool , Dr._Heenan , and the Anglican Archbishop of York , Dr._Ramsey , recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury . The good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well_known in England .</context>

      <context> Of_course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr._Fisher , then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury , to the Vatican last December . It was the first time an English Primate has done this since the 14th century . English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope . Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants ; news of a Protestant <head>minister</head> in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary_school during the sickness of one of its masters ; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` Catholics , if the present system is still in_operation , will constitute almost one-third of the House_of_Lords in the next generation '' ; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic_church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave .</context>

On April 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board . In a periodic review , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1_,_-_A and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home .</context>

      <context> Such was not the case in Rhode_Island . The only public demonstration in honor of John_Brown was held at Pratt_'s_Hall in Providence , on the day of his execution . Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt_Hall meeting `` brought_together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many_of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' . Seated on the platform were Amos_C._Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; Thomas_Davis , an uncompromising Garrisonian ; the Reverend_Augustus_Woodbury , a Unitarian <head>minister</head> ; the Reverend_George_T._Day , a Free-Will Baptist ; Daniel_w._Vaughan , and William_H._H._Clements . The latter two were appointed secretaries . The first speaker was Amos_C._Barstow who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting . He spoke of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared John_Brown of Harper_'s_Ferry to the John_Brown of Rhode_Island 's colonial period .</context>

      <context> They held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot . Kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment . She would not accept the death of such a little child . `` God called her to Him '' , the <head>minister</head> had said . God would not do that , Kate thought stubbornly . Jonathan 's letter came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child 's death as another judgment from God against both Kate and himself . In blind panic of grief she accepted Jonathan 's dictum , and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by God .</context>

      <context> The scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands . The child was gone . When Juanita awoke , Kate was still rocking the dead child , still crooning in disbelief , `` No , no , oh , no ! '' They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent_for the young Presbyterian <head>minister</head> . He sat beside Kate 's bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God 's will , while Kate lay staring angrily at him . When he told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words rebelliously . Few of the neighbors came , but Mrs._Tussle came , called by tragedy .</context>
