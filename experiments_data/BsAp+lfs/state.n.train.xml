      <context> In the Blue_Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting_precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according_to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a <head>state</head> law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system - a system which the party opposes in its platform .

      <context> Gov._Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment . Vandiver likely will mention the $ 100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . Meanwhile , it was learned the State_Highway_Department is very near being ready to issue the first $ 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . The bond issue will go to the <head>state</head> courts for a friendly test_suit to test the validity of the act , and_then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway_Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural_Roads_Authority bonds for rural road construction work . The department apparently intends to make the Rural_Roads_Authority a revolving_fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid_off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov._Marvin_Griffin .</context>

When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas . Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen._Parkhouse . The bill would increase from $ 5000000 to $ 15000000 the maximum loan the <head>state</head> could make to a local water_project . Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas . Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water_program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten 's attack .

      <context> I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal_Newman . As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated country . Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England . In representing part of this new picture , I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments ; but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican_Churches and about the present religious <head>state</head> of England . Since the Protestant clergy for_the_most_part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my Roman_collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman_Catholic cleric .

      <context> The true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this . `` Eve was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as_yet she was a virgin . And even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as_yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human_race ; so also did Mary , having a man betrothed [ to her ] , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human_race '' . Because he interprets the primitive <head>state</head> of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no_doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' . His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary . That parallelism affects his picture of man 's disobedience too ; for as it was Christ , the Word_of_God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word_of_God in_the_beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe . With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality .</context>
    </instance>
    <instance id="br-d04#w1554_0" docsrc="br-d04">
      <context> Nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God , and he still rules . Even death , therefore , has a providential as_well_as a punitive function . `` Wherefore also He [ God ] drove him [ man ] out of Paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because He envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because He pitied him , [ and did not desire ] that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable . But He set a bound to his [ <head>state</head> of ] sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take_place in the earth , so_that man , ceasing at_length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to God '' . This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus ' theology ; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ . As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life . It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is .</context>

      <context> The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural_order of time and change . On_the_other_hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence . It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law . If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the <head>state</head> into which man is put by the will of the Creator . This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced . If death receives more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through Christ begins to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence . Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history .</context>

      <context> At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on_trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as_well_as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ?

In_other_words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted_on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .</context>

The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' . But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann 's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it . Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and <head>states</head> . Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ?</context>

      <context> I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? - liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as_well_as democratic processes may have to yield before it .

As for <head>states</head> ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms .

      <context> This notion of the General Will gave_rise to the Commune_of_Paris in the Revolution and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship . And it is clearly argued by Lord_Percy of Newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , The Heresy_of_Democracy , and in a more general way by Voegelin , in his New_Science_of_Politics , that this same Rousseauan idea , descending through European democracy , is the source of Marx 's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat . This is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after World_War_2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace . The long road that had taken liberals in_this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist <head>State</head> . And the USSR existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in_this country was spiritually Marxist . We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San_Francisco to set_up the legal framework , finally and at_last , to rationalize war - to rationalize want and fear - out of the world : the United_Nations .</context>

      <context> There is evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William_Gilmore_Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such_as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him . Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus_Baldwin_Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern <head>states</head> , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy_Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him . Others who wrote_of low characters and low life included Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , creator of the Big_Bear of Arkansas and Tom_Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson_Jones_Hooper , whose character Simon_Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem_Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried_out his will ; and George_Washington_Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut_Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner 's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a_hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner 's time . Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long established literary precedent .</context>

      <context> Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78_th_Congress in 1943 passed P._L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure .

These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services .</context>

This can be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared .

      <context> Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types . Two of the fluids showed a high positive normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in_comparison_with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two . Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure . Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady <head>state</head> was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built_up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate . A system had_to be used which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time . A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure . By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular_weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an atmosphere .</context>

The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular_weights which were stated to be 520 and 300 .

The maximum suction was 3.25 '' of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady <head>states</head> were apparently reached with these fluids . It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus .

      <context> This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock_therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl_test . Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl_test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm . Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not_yet been tested on an adequate number of patients . The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical <head>states</head> , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable . It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep wakefulness cycle . A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting .

Thus , a low intensity of hypothalamic cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition .

      <context> In America also all_of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common religion . Even the non church_members - the freewheelers , marginal religionists and_so_on - have the values of Christian civilization internalized in them . Furthermore , religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values ; for_example , those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends . Finally , it gives sanctity , more than human legitimacy , and even , through super empirical reference , transcendent and supernatural importance to some values ; for_example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the <head>state</head> as a divine instrument . It places certain values at_least beyond questioning and tampering . Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends . This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social Plan with a meaning interpretable in_terms_of ultimate ends ; for_example , a plan that fulfills the will of God , which advances the Kingdom_of_God , which involves social life as part of the Grand Design .</context>

      <context> For_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got_up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the end of each session . Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met . This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard_to the wishes of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy_chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold <head>state</head> , and plunking myself down in my chair - in_short , behaving as if I owned her room . Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement . One finds , for_example , that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression , seeming at_first to be a mere hollow convention , reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings , and the most unconventional of meanings . More_than anything , it is the therapist 's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a spread-out deck_of_cards , on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient 's and his months of work together .</context>

Let us suppose that the animal did not in_fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at_all , but that we mistakenly believe it did , and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing . On the positivist theory , everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second . In the only sense in which badness is involved at_all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety , since all that is expressed in either case is a <head>state</head> of feeling , and that feeling is still there . And our question is , is such an implication consistent with what we meant ? Clearly it is not . If anyone asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at_all , we should say that it made all the difference in_the_world , that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our assertion was in that case mistaken .</context>

      <context> I called the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves_Moreland , the Anglo-American literary critic - his mother was_born in Ohio - who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson_Downs , raising_hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old_man about the <head>state</head> of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such_as human stature , hope , and humor . My unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in_terms_of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe_in the cult_of_personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . A bee 's place is in the hive '' .</context>

      <context> Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead , as a dealer in Khartoum assured me , I am not competent to say . Likewise the ivory Chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance Honan ) ; a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack . The three Indian brass deities , though - Ganessa , Siva , and Krishna - are an altogether different cup_of_tea . They hail from Travancore , a <head>state</head> in the subcontinent where Kali , the goddess of death , is worshiped . Have you ever heard of thuggee ? Nuf sed . But it is the wooden sculpture from Bali , the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish , that I particularly call to your attention .</context>

      <context> From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade handled magnifying_glass . Rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby , you unearthed an antique French chess_set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box_Kodaks , you added to your haul . Then , having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on , you lammed out the front_door , considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover . So_much_for the tiresome facts , as familiar to you , I'm sure , as to the constables and <head>state</head> troopers who followed in your wake . The foregoing , aided by several clues I 'll withhold to keep you on_your_toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of Inspector_Javert , but before they close_in , gird yourselves , I repeat , for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless . Fourteen of the sculptures you took posses properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls_out in patches . In_time , these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce , riddling you with frambesia , the king's_evil , sheep_rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry_out_for release .</context>
