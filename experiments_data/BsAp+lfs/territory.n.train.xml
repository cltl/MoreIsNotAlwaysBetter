      <context> When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O_'_Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $ 20000 a month . In six months O_'_Banion had boosted the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb . These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; once_again O_'_Banion 's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill_will . The revenue from O_'_Banion 's Cicero <head>territory</head> went_up still higher , until the yield was more_than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago 's South and West_Sides . But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate . At_last , even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O_'_Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in_return for one from his Cicero beer concession . O_'_Banion 's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .</context>

      <context> Although Brooklyn_College does not_yet have a junior year abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in Europe . In_general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard or Smith . And acculturation into the world at_large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn_College student after college rather_than during the four school_years . Brooklyn_College is Marjorie_Morningstar <head>territory</head> , as much_as the_Bronx or Central_Park_West . There are hordes of nubile young_women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry . It is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere - about 30 per_cent of the women and 25 per_cent of the men in the graduating_class - the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed_up the estimate . `` Almost everybody in the senior_class is married '' , students say dogmatically .</context>

      <context> There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto Yokuts . This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very_much larger <head>territory</head> ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; or both . The differentiation however is not very_much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . ( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem / item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . ) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison .</context>

Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas , occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent_on the propagation of slavery in that <head>territory</head> , call_for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice .

On the morning following the Pratt_Hall meeting the editor of the Providence_Daily_Journal wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes , it could have been avoided completely .</context>
