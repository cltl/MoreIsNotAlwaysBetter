The coalition was to prove inadvisable . O_'_Banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright_blue eyes stared with a kind_of frozen candour into others ' .

      <context> If the change , at_first_sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the Italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen . In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as_well_as a mechanical recording device . He did more than that . He revealed the potential value of the `` <head>cut</head> '' as the basic technique in the art of the film . Cutting , of_course , takes_place automatically in the creation of a film . The meaning of the word is quite physical , to_begin_with . The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence .</context>

      <context> Previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take_place . The radiochlorine was stored at_- 78 ` in a tube equipped with a break_seal . Liter quantities of Mallinckrodt , low sulfur , reagent grade carbon_tetrachloride were saturated with * * f and * * f and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a_few inches . The mixture was then extracted with alkali and with water following which the carbon_tetrachloride was distilled on a Vigreux column , a 25 % center <head>cut</head> being retained which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of * * f . Purified inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen_out and sealed_off in a flask equipped with a break_seal . This chlorine carbon_tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distilled off . The required amount of carbon_tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on a manifold on a vacuum line .</context>
