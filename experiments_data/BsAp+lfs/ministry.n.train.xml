      <context> I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets . Along the main thoroughfares hardly_a house had not been peppered . In place of the police_headquarters was a new square filled with rubble . Mortars had demolished the defense <head>ministry</head> and set fire to the American Embassy next_door . What had been the ambassador 's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick . This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane , fought less_than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( December 9 - 11 , 1960 ) . And now , in March , all Laos suffered a state of siege .</context>

      <context> If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 per_cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact . On the surface , this seems a sound approach to Christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care_for new people ; the new people respond in_kind by joining the church . Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations . This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking_up the wave_lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; the lay <head>ministry</head> is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social_class nucleus of the congregation . Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so_long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless - friendly contacts no_longer keep it going . The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational_activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members . The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17.3 per_cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) .</context>
