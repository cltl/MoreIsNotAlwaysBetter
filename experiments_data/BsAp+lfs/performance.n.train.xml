      <context> The voices of all the characters , including that of Cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities . And the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed . Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here . Splendid , too , is the <head>performance</head> of Yuri_Tolubeyev , one of Russia 's leading comedians , as Sancho_Panza , the fat , grotesque `` squire '' . Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness - a sort_of peasant dignity - too . It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons . The episode in which Sancho_Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island '' is one of the best in the film .</context>

      <context> So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein , but not great Brahms . The concert opened with another big romantic score , Schumann's Overture_to_Manfred , which suffered fate , this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat . Hindemith 's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands translucent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit . It got the kind of scrambled , coarsened <head>performance</head> that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style . The Bayreuth_Festival opens July 23 with a new production of `` Tannhaeuser '' staged by Wieland_Wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by Wolfgang_Sawallisch . Sawalisch also conducts `` The_Flying_Dutch '' , opening July 24 . `` Parsifal '' follows July 25 , with Hans_Knappertsbusch conducting , and he also conducts `` Die_Meistersinger '' , to be presented Aug. 8 and 12 .</context>

      <context> It is not news that Nathan_Milstein is a wizard of the violin . Certainly not in Orchestra_hall where he has played countless recitals , and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago_Symphony_orchestra , playing the Brahms_Concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed . There was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white_heat . Not the noblest <head>performance</head> we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent . Those would be reserved for the orchestra 's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself . This time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood . But he had in Walter_Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point .</context>

      <context> Technically it was fascinating , aurally spell-binding , and dramatically quite realistic . Many years have passed since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable . Her debut over , perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine . The <head>performance</head> also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor , Silvio_Varviso . He injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years .

      <context> If so , it might be worth_while to assign a future jazz show to a different department - one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut_down on the number of performers and give them a_little room to display their talents . As_a_matter_of_fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results . A_few years ago a `` Timex All Star Jazz Show '' offered a broad range of styles , ranging from Lionel_Hampton 's big_band to the free-wheeling Dukes_of_Dixieland . An enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live '' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of <head>performance</head> . About that same time John_Crosby 's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing_space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do . In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods . The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music .</context>

      <context> The jazz buff could hardly ask for more . Furthermore , Garry_Moore makes an ideal master_of_ceremonies . ( He played host at the Timex show already mentioned . ) One of the script 's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live <head>performances</head> by musicians of today . NBC had gathered a_lot of historical material which it was eager to share . For_example , there was sheet_music with the word `` jazz '' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took_hold . Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone_poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 's .</context>

      <context> The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing_ovation as Miss_Sutherland took curtain_call after curtain_call following a fantastic `` Mad_Scene '' created on_her_own and with the help of the composer and the other performers . Her entrance in Scene_2_,_Act_1 , brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note . Thereafter the audience waxed applause happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization . As she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of <head>performances</head> of `` Lucia '' . She topped the sextet brilliantly . Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` Mad_Scene '' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment . Miss_Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene : A much more girlish Lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role .</context>

      <context> But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems . Since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall_into the category of chamber_music - yet it calls_for a double_bass , an instrument generally regarded_as symphonic . Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather_than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . The many and frequent <head>performances</head> of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing . Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free_rein .

      <context> Command 's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one . Like the recent Scheherazade from London ( High_Fidelity , Sept. 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather_than on creating sensational effects . Because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers ' triumph . The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg <head>performance</head> with minimal alteration of its musical values . The engineering as_such never obtrudes_upon your consciousness . The effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance . This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not_only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue .</context>

      <context> Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation .

      <context> Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced . And although Schnabel 's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert 's dynamic markings and phrase indications . The piano <head>performance</head> on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives . About the Pro_Arte 's contribution I am less happy . I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group .

Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world_premiere of the Love_for_Three_Oranges , and played the first <head>performance</head> of his Third_Piano_Concerto . `` Uncle_Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden_Twenties '' . We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano_sonatas , chamber_music , gavottes , and marches ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities .

      <context> As a boy Roy_Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods . His father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting_expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature . Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on_the_wing - almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . It is this subject_matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional <head>performance</head> with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors . Mason had_to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting . Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family_business which , though it was allied to art of a kind - the design and production of engraved seals - bore no relation to the painting of pictures . But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial_art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia .</context>

      <context> We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates . For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody . Professionally a lawyer , that_is_to_say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed_up , disguised - that_is , paradoxically , revealed - as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child . That this abandonment takes_place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' <head>performance</head> , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring_down upon him the punishment for art ; that_is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann 's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even_though the constant elements of the artist nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and La^utner . It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann 's early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic . In a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one_and_the_same . Something of this can be learned from `` The_Way_to_the_Churchyard '' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure .</context>

      <context> ( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade . Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line_of_work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation requiring a great_deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour . It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more_than the foregoing facts [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the <head>performance</head> capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , - that_is , from one end to the other - was unimpaired '' . If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense_of_touch can be explained by his defective visual condition . But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at_hand .

Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov_Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach lay_dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas passed_through his `` purgatory '' of neglect . But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc_Schlek_, Jr. , a major revival is under_way . As he leads the Neurenschatz_Skolkau_Orchestra , Schlek gives a tremendously inspired <head>performance</head> of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor 's insistence . A major portion of the credit should also go to flautist Haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` Indianapolis '' movement in the Baslot . Not_only was Haumd 's intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in_stride . For_example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest F major register up_to a barely audible N minor in four seconds , not skipping , at_the_same_time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist 's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage .</context>
