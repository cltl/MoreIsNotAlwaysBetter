      <context> Time and space have both become cinematic . We leap from event to event - including the formation of the posse - even though the events , in `` reality '' are taking_place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance . The `` chase '' as a standard film device probably dates_from The_Great_Train_Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device . The chase in itself is a narrative ; it presumes both speed and <head>urgency</head> and it demands cutting - both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not_only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; these films and these sequences are also seeking_out - instinctively or by_design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative . There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art .</context>

      <context> But the Latin_American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American_Defense_Board . For years the United_States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro 's representative from secret military talks . But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job . There is a new atmosphere of <head>urgency</head> in Washington this week . You can see it , for_example , in the extensive efforts President_Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by_the_way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past . What the next move will be only time , of_course , will tell . Personally , I think we ought to set_up an immediate naval_blockade of Cuba .</context>

      <context> `` Miss_Sarah , I can n't cut_up no chicken . Miss_Maude say she won n't '' . Again the homely , everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious attempt to frighten her - or to murder her . The homely everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate <head>urgency</head> . No_matter what had happened or had n't happened , somebody had_to see about dinner . She eyed the chickens with , if she had known it , something of Glendora 's dismal look and thought with a certain fury of the time she had spent on Latin verbs .</context>
