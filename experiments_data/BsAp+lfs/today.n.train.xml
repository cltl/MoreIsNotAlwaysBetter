      <context> Another source of NBC pride was its rare film_clip of Bix_Beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew_by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted_out the entire glimpse . Similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz_groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal . `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' may have wound_up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer . By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for <head>today</head> 's artists , the program turned_out to be a not quite perfect example of either . Still , the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated . Even Joan_Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan_Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti 's `` Lucia_di_Lammermoor '' Sunday night . The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing_ovation as Miss_Sutherland took curtain_call after curtain_call following a fantastic `` Mad_Scene '' created on_her_own and with the help of the composer and the other performers .</context>

      <context> She topped the sextet brilliantly . Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` Mad_Scene '' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment . Miss_Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene : A much more girlish Lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role . What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as Miss_Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos <head>today</head> . This big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined . Nervousness at_the_start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene , or she may warm_up slowly . In the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently .</context>

      <context> Still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing . An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true . A century ago , Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English_Protestantism , and that even high_Anglicanism would someday no_longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own '' . That day is perhaps <head>today</head> , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' . One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite . Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy . The London_Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping_out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one_hundred years .</context>

      <context> Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs . Now , not_only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious_orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non_Catholic members of the University . Some Catholic priests lecture there ; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students . Further evidence that Roman_Catholicism enjoys a more favorable_position <head>today</head> than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to_it in the mass_media of England . The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester_Guardian and the Sunday_Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic_Church is now at_least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches . On successive Sundays during October , 1960 , Paul_Ferris ( a non-Catholic ) wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen of the Church_of_England , the Church_of_Rome and the Nonconformist_Church . The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came_out the best .</context>

Once you become an avocado fan , you will look_forward to the season each_year with eager anticipation . <head>Today</head> , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world . The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point . It is brought to packing_houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior . The fruit is then cooled to 42 ` F. , a temperature at which it lapses into a sort_of dormant state .</context>

      <context> Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey_Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had - and this was limited to a_few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together - Roy developed his art by himself . In the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and_then to paint . He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the Academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium . Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until <head>today</head> it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique . It has been my privilege to paint with Roy_Mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of Batavia . More_often_than_not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting . What I have observed time_and_time_again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes_on recognizable form ; color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition ; and that over_all , amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark .</context>

Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man_of_affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No_doubt many_of the citizens of the Third_Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them <head>today</head> . The Final_Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others . Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once_and_for_all by showing how representative types of `` mere '' anti-Semites were drawn step_by_step into the program of skull bashings and gassings ? The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' .</context>

The market <head>today</head> for detergent_builders is quite diverse . The best_known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up_to 50 % by weight of sodium_tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium_tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium_pyrophosphate . In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; and the dwindling built soap_powders as_well_as soap_flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised .</context>

      <context> Federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local districts must pay at_least half . The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . Throughout the history of the program , state_government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures , while local districts all_together have spent more_than either Federal or state_governments . <head>Today</head> , Federal funds account_for only one-fifth of the nation 's expenditures for vocational education . The greatest impact of the matching fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds . National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades . During World_War 2 , about 7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) Vocational Education for National Defense , and ( 2 ) War Production Training .</context>

      <context> The European customs on which international_law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states . Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed countries . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , <head>today</head> . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system .</context>

      <context> whether there is such fitness or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do . Let me illustrate . In his novel The_House_of_the_Dead , Dostoevsky tells of his experiences in a Siberian prison_camp . Whatever the unhappy inmates of such camps are like <head>today</head> , Dostoevsky 's companions were about as grim a lot as can be imagined . `` I have heard stories '' , he writes , `` of the most terrible , the most unnatural actions , of the most monstrous murders , told with the most spontaneous , childishly merry laughter '' . Most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very unfitting . If we were asked why we thought so , we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong , and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting .</context>
