Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` On_the_Side_of_the_Angels '' and `` Politics_and_Poker '' were handled splendidly , and I thought Rudy_Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` Little_Tin_Box '' even better than it was done by the <head>New_York</head> cast ; all the words of its clever lyrics came_through with perfect clarity . The party at Floyd 's penthouse gave the `` chorines '' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era 's nonsense . LaGuardia 's multi lingual rallies , when he is running for Congress , are well staged , and wind_up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical_theater .

His life-long friend , Serge_Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , <head>New_York</head> , and Washington , D._C. , to_which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation . Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world_premiere of the Love_for_Three_Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third_Piano_Concerto . `` Uncle_Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden_Twenties '' .

Generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife 's mercy . `` The pattern '' , says Dr._Morton_Schillinger , psychologist at <head>New_York</head> 's Lincoln_Institute_for_Psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night '' . No one seriously contends , of_course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world . After_all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as Dr._Schillinger points_out . There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master_bedroom .</context>

      <context> Furthermore , Dr._Calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around . They are n't `` frigid '' and they are n't homosexual ; they 're just restrained in all of life . They like to be dominated . One such man once confided to Dr._Theodor_Reik , <head>New_York</head> psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor . Asked why , he replied primly : `` Because that 's no activity for a gentleman '' . But such cases were , in the past , unusual .</context>

      <context> This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations . To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores . Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing - and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them . One wife , described by a <head>New_York</head> psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual_relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday night neighborhood card parties . Another put sex on a dollars and cents basis . After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband 's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor . Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .</context>

      <context> Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought_on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr._Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies . Interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney_General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke_off the flow . But there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and <head>New_York</head> . In each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin 's dictatorship ; in the United_States the initiation of militant anti Communism , with the repentant ex Communist in the vanguard .

      <context> The Jewish working_girl almost invariably works in an office - in contradistinction to gentile factory_workers - and , buttressed by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college_student .

This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like <head>New_York</head> , Chicago , and Philadelphia . What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self_enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non Jewish world . Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn_College - constituting 85 per_cent of those who attend the day session - can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower_middle_class Jewish student .

      <context> Though Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious_belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown . Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central_city would be likely to destroy this preference - and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians , is actually upon us . In their book American_Skyline , Christopher_Tunnard and Henry_Hope_Reed argue that Franklin_Roosevelt 's New_Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility - a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote . The first superhighways - <head>New_York</head> 's Henry_Hudson and Chicago 's Lake_Shore , San_Francisco 's Bay_Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania_Turnpike - were built as part of the federal works_program which was going_to cure the depression . At_the_same_time , Roosevelt 's Federal_Housing_Administration , coupled with Henry_Morgenthau 's cheap-money policy , permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes . Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U._S. government ; householders who had been unable to pick_up the burden of short-term high interest mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per_cent , under government aegis .</context>

During the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster_casts and spatter prints of Catskill flowers and leaves was all_but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions of Jessica that my mind served_up to me for contemplation and delight . Nothing in_all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world . In final separation from them , in the railroad_terminal across the river from <head>New_York</head> , I would nearly cry . My parents ' welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted . But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or mess-hall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond . These letters became the center of my existence .</context>
