      <context> The Fulton_County_Grand_Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary_election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took_place . The jury further said in term end presentments that the City_Executive_Committee , which had over-all <head>charge</head> of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City_of_Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . The September October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior_Court_Judge_Durwood_Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate_Ivan_Allen_Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of_this city '' . The jury said it did find that many_of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' .</context>

      <context> President_Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation . If we wait until children are in junior_high or high_school , we will never manage it . To be fit , one has_to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance . If the dance teachers of America make it their business to prepare their young <head>charges</head> for the gymnastics that must come some_day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that_much ahead . School_teachers , all_too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators . There should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it . They should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught .</context>

      <context> The total is the probable gross income from farming . To find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming . Include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm_buildings and equipment . Also count as an expense a <head>charge</head> for the labor to be contributed by the family . It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it . Otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor . To figure the value of the farm in_terms_of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way .</context>

      <context> Had the situation been reversed , had , for_instance , England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New_England , there is little doubt that large_numbers of Southerners would have happily put_on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain . It is extraordinary that a_people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have . The North should thank_its_stars that such has been the case ; but at_the_same_time it should not draw false inferences therefrom . The two main <head>charges</head> levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries . There is much truth in both these charges , and not many Bourbons deny them . Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites . Most_of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure .</context>

      <context> This help is offered to applicants who ordinarily would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds from commercial sources on reasonable terms . Each applicant is required to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored . The Government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up_to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses . The applicant pays the rest of the cost , but his own time spent on the work and <head>charges</head> for the use of equipment which he owns may be applied toward his share of the cost . Funds contributed by the Government are repaid by a royalty on production from the property . If nothing is produced , there is no obligation to repay . A 5 - percent royalty is paid on any production during the period the contract is in_effect ; if the Government certifies that production may be possible from the property , the royalty obligation continues for the 10 - year period usually specified in the contract or until the Government 's contribution is repaid with interest .</context>

      <context> An alternate roof , perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach , could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams , overlaid with boards and waterproofing . It would have_to be covered with at_least 28 inches of pit-run gravel . The materials for a double wall shelter would cost about $ 700 . Contractors ' <head>charges</head> would be additional . The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection . Pre shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground . These are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface .</context>

      <context> They form effective fallout_shelters when mounded_over with earth , as shown in figure 10 . Materials for this shelter would cost about $ 700 . A contractor probably would be required to help build it . His <head>charges</head> would be added to the cost of materials . This shelter , as shown on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation . An alternate hatchway entrance , shown on page 25 , would reduce the cost of materials $ 50 to $ 100 . The National_Lumber_Manufacturers_Association , Washington , D._C. , is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction .</context>

      <context> The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically held by surface irregularities to some extent . However , a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes_under_the_name_of van_der_Waal_'s_forces . This is a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles , or to stick_to an uncharged surface . Obviously , if colloidal particles bear <head>charges</head> of opposite sign or , if one kind is charged and the other kind is not , the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced . Likewise , a charged particle will tend to stick_to an uncharged surface and vice_versa , and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge . In_addition , dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface_tension of liquids , including liquid greases . Greases , stains , and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface .</context>

      <context> He was fortunate , and proud . The veterans , idling on their benches in the Square , beneath the soldiers ' monument , got_to_their_feet when Papa approached : `` Morning , Reverend '' ! His being and His will - Stevie could not divide God from his Papa - illumined every parish face , turned the choir into a band of angels , and the pulpit into the tollgate to Heaven . `` We have nine hundred and eleven members in our <head>charge</head> '' , Mama announced , `` and three hundred and eighty Sunday-school scholars '' . When Papa went_out to do God 's work , Stevie often accompanied him in the buggy , which was drawn by Violet , the new black mare . Although they journeyed westerly as far as Germantown , beyond the Erie roundhouse and the machine_shop , and along the Delaware and Hudson_Canal , and northward to Brooklyn , below Point_Peter , he could see the church spire wherever he looked_back . Sometimes they went south and rolled past the tollhouse - `` Afternoon , Reverend '' !</context>

      <context> I had squeezed the trigger of my own gun , and to my amazement , it had fired and kicked_back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule ; and then I was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound , hurling more vile language than I ever thought I knew , sobbing and shouting , and aware that if I had passed_water before , it was not enough , for my pants were soaking wet . I would have stood there and died there if left to myself , but Cousin_Simmons grabbed my arm in his viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there ; and_then I came_to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I outdistanced Cousin_Simmons by_far . Everyone else was running . Later we realized that the redcoats had stopped their <head>charge</head> at the wall . Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching . We tumbled to a stop in Deacon_Gordon 's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle . A dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped_up handfuls of_it .</context>
