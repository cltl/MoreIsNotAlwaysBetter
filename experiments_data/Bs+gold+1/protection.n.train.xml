      <context> They germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily . It does n't really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours . I like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold_frames . Pansies do n't have to be coddled ; they 'd rather have things rugged , with only moderate <head>protection</head> on the coldest days . If you do use a cold_frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate . For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting . I dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray .</context>

      <context> Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks <head>protection</head> in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the nations . But though this characterization in_no_way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of_it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final_Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ?</context>

      <context> Will advances in human sciences help us build social_structures and governments which will enable us to cope_with people as_effectively_as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic_acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? The answer is of_course yes . For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people . Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant <head>protection</head> of a boat the formulations of Archimedes . But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides . We have ample light when the sun sets ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; the range of our voice ignores distance . At what stage are social_sciences then ?</context>

      <context> The master of the house , his nourished face unrevealing , consented to postpone his departure a_few minutes to talk to the detective . Inside , as_soon_as Mr._Skopas had disclosed - in a hoarse whisper - the detective 's errand , his family gathered in a huddle , forming a mass of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of a baroque fireplace . Flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps , they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait . It was amazing how they had herded together for <head>protection</head> : an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper , rising from the breakfast_table ; a gross boy in his teens , shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; a girl in her twenties , fat and sullen , descending the marble staircase ; then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor . They answered him in monosyllables , nods , occasionally muttering in Greek to one another , awaiting the word from Papa , who restlessly cracked his knuckles , anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst off to the freeway . No , they had n't seen anyone around ; no , they did n't know the Andrus family ; yes , they had read about the case ; yes , they had let some reporters use their phone , but they would no_longer . They offered no opinions , volunteered nothing , betrayed no emotions .</context>

      <context> Most of them were elderly men . It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of New_York . They were n't as well paid as they should have been . One reason the portwatchers let Sposato take them over was to get the <head>protection</head> of his musclemen . Sposato needed a front , some labor stiff with a clean record to act_as business_agent of the Redhook local . There I was a retired wobbly and structural iron_worker who 'd never gouged a cent off a fellow_worker in my thirty years in the movement . For once radicalism was a recommendation .</context>
