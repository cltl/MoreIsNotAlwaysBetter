      <context> Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final_Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? Should not everyone have been awakened to_it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard_to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a <head>recovery</head> of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by_no_means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) . Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin . It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe . It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; most_of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War_Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors ' accounts .</context>

      <context> These were read at 280 m | m in a Beckman model DU spectrophotometer and tested for antibody activity as described above . For protein identification , fractions from the column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5 ` C or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline . During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at 2 ` C by surrounding the apparatus with ice . Because negative pressure dialysis gave better <head>recovery</head> of proteins , permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler procedure , it was used in all but the earliest experiments . Paper_electrophoresis was carried_out on the concentrated samples in a Spinco model R cell using barbital buffer , pH 8.6 , ionic strength 0.075 , at room_temperature on Whatman 3 MM filter_paper . Five milliamperes / cell were applied for 18 hr , after which the strips were stained with bromophenol_blue and densitometry was carried_out using a Spinco_Analytrol . When paper_electrophoresis was to be used for preparation , eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run / chamber under the conditions described above .</context>

      <context> Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a_few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . Three weeks later following his <head>recovery</head> , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district_attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . Both Cook 's and Russell 's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in_the_end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion .</context>
