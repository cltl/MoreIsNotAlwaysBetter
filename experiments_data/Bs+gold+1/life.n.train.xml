      <context> If the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied . Check the quality of the water . A stream which has all_of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing_through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area . Other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish <head>life</head> it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value . Other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand_dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed . Just_as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek_out these features which are distinctive of their area . Although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site .</context>

      <context> This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or_else colors only the outside . A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible_light with ultraviolet_radiation and combines a microscope with a color - TV_system to view the results . Fig. 1 is a simplified block_diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical_Electronics_Center of Rockefeller_Institute . By combining the talents of a medical_man , Dr._Aterman , a biophysicist , Mr._Berkely , and an electronics expert , Dr._Zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding <head>life</head> processes . Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet_radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in_front_of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources . These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; the specimen is magnified by the microscope . Instead of the observer 's eye the image_orthicon in the TV_camera does the `` looking '' .</context>

      <context> Polyphosphates gave renewed <head>life</head> to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . The market today for detergent_builders is quite diverse . The best_known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up_to 50 % by weight of sodium_tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium_tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium_pyrophosphate .</context>

      <context> Three weeks later following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district_attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . Both Cook 's and Russell 's <head>lives</head> were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in_the_end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion . General_manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather_than accept their offers to sell_out and move away , and try to have a_few punished . On February 17 , Russell and Cook were sent to the Pena_Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting_out ranches the company had purchased . While talking with Julian_M._Beall , Francisco_Archuleta and Juan_Marcus appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for_a_while , rode_away .</context>

      <context> Abel sat and regarded the farm country which , spreading_out from both sides of the road , rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields . He saw the land with a stranger 's eyes , all the old familiarness gone . And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself . There was stability there , too - a color which his <head>life</head> had had once . That is what childhood is , he told himself . Solid , settled , lost . In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone_poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt_Jessica 's letter .</context>

They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually .

There was really no reason to refuse , and Linda_Kay had never ridden in a Cadillac . Driving along the caliche-topped road to town , Howard talked . Finally he said , `` Tell me about yourself '' , and Linda_Kay told him , because she thought herself that she had had an interesting <head>life</head> . She was such a well-rounded teenager , having been a twirler , Future_Farmers sweetheart , and secretary of Future_Homemakers .

      <context> The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue_pie , gets a plate of English_muffins instead . Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after_all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks_Atkinson retired . Aging but still precocious , French feline enfant_terrible Francoisette_Lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old Paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called The_Lascivious_Interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in_love with a middle-aged steam_shovel . A biting , pithy parable of the all pervading hollowness of modern <head>life</head> , the piece has been set by Mlle_Lagoon to a sumptuous score ( a single motif played over_and_over by four thousand French_horns ) by existentialist hot-shot Jean-Paul_Sartre . Petite , lovely Yvette_Chadroe plays the nymphomaniac engagingly . Ever since Bambi , and , more recently , Born_Free , there have been a_lot of books about animals , but few compare with Max_Fink 's wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable My_Friend_, the Quizzical_Salamander . Done in the modern style of a `` confession '' , Fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother 's pet salamander , Alicia .</context>
