      <context> But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather_than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location . Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness . Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists_of minute <head>waves</head> of energy . We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound_waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite . So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states_of_matter , successive one_after_another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies . This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .</context>

      <context> At 6_o_'_clock on the morning of August 12 , they were in doubt no_longer . Then it came , against Troop_H . The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with Russian machine_guns , attacked the position held by Chandler 's men . They came in <head>waves</head> . First came the cannon_fodder , white clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering_ram . They were followed by crack North_Korean troops , who mounted one charge after another . They overran the 7_th_Cav 's forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers , over piles of_their_own dead .</context>

      <context> The primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impressed us . What one actually remembers is its greenness . From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible . One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking <head>wave</head> of flower . Every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit_trees . In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet_shrub , snowball , rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead . From above one could only occasionally catch_a_glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block .</context>

      <context> one cannot assume , of_course , that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later_on when the stereotype was uttered ; probably it is correct to think_of it as a matter of a well grooved , stereotyped mode of expression - and no , or but a_few , other communicational grooves , as_yet - being there , available for the patient 's use , as newly emerging emotions and ideas well_up in him over the course of months . But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at_work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another . Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype - a `` How are you now '' ? or an `` I want to go_home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning . A hebephrenic man used_to give a repetitious <head>wave</head> of his hand a number of times during his largely silent hours with his therapist . When the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` What is that , Bill - hello or farewell '' ? , the patient replied , `` Both , Dearie - two in one '' . Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression , that which seems best to give release , and communicational expression , to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter .</context>

      <context> `` I asked her why she could n't do it tomorrow , but it seems the muse is working good tonight and she 's afraid to let_it_go '' . Casey made some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man . His name was George_Needham and he , too , had come from a good family . He was perhaps thirty-two , nicely set_up , with light_brown hair that had a pronounced <head>wave</head> . He was always well groomed and well tailored , and he had that rich_man 's look which was authentic enough and came from two good prep_schools and a proper university . An only child , he had done all the things that young_men do who have been born to money and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke . Since then he had worked_at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling .</context>

      <context> I drank furiously . A long time . Emptied the bottle . Teeth again flashing back at me , the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which `` amigo '' appeared every_so_often like an island in the stormy <head>waves</head> of surrounding sound . I bobbed my head each time it appeared . Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son_of_a_bitch '' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer_bottle into Johnson 's quivering ribs . A big car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning .</context>

      <context> Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer . The calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend Cromwell . Alexander knew Spencer too well to think him naive or thick-skulled . And in a sudden <head>wave</head> of painful clarity , Alexander recognized a kinship with Spencer . Here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable . There was good_fortune and there was bad and Philip_Spencer , in handcuffs and ankle irons , knew it to be a truth . He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune .</context>
