      <context> `` Eve was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as_yet she was a virgin . And even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as_yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human_race ; so also did Mary , having a man betrothed [ to her ] , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human_race '' . Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no_doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' . His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the <head>end</head> prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary . That parallelism affects his picture of man 's disobedience too ; for as it was Christ , the Word_of_God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word_of_God in_the_beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe . With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality . At the nadir of that circuit is death .</context>

    <instance id="br-d04#w1572_0" docsrc="br-d04">
      <context> Nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God , and he still rules . Even death , therefore , has a providential as_well_as a punitive function . `` Wherefore also He [ God ] drove him [ man ] out of Paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because He envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because He pitied him , [ and did not desire ] that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable . But He set a bound to his [ state of ] sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an <head>end</head> to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take_place in the earth , so_that man , ceasing at_length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to God '' . This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus ' theology ; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ . As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life . It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is .</context>

The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam . As Origen interprets the <head>end</head> of history on the basis of its beginning , so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of Christ . `` Whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ? From God 's Will and Wisdom , and from virgin earth . For ' God had not rained ' , says the Scripture , before man was made , ' and there was no man to till the earth ' .</context>

      <context> The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil_War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way_of_life which had been destroyed . As they looked with_nostalgia to a society which had been swept_away , they were probably no_more than half conscious that they painted_in_colors which had never existed . Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp . The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas_Nelson_Page toward the <head>end</head> of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So_Red_the_Rose , by Stark_Young . Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark_Young 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook .</context>

      <context> To believe otherwise would be unrealistic . But in looking_at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the South , it is important not to lose the broader perspective . His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers . Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic_romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the <head>end</head> of the preceding century , and in_particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry_James and James_Joyce among them . His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him . My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked_at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by_no_means new with him , and most_of the problems he takes_up have had the attention of authors before him .</context>

      <context> they `` transform and beautify our inner nature '' . It is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea .

      <context> Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army_Reserve . Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National_Guard contained in the 1960 Department_of_Defense Appropriation_Act should likewise be dropped . I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . I again proposed a reduction in the Army National_Guard and Army_Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the <head>end</head> of the fiscal_year 1961 . These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives . - About 30 % of the expenditures for the Department_of_Defense in 1961 are for military_personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel . These expenditures are estimated to be $ 12.1 billion , an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social_security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) .</context>

      <context> Physicochemical investigations of anionic surfactants , including the soaps , have shown that there is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration . ( 1 ) Below the critical micelle concentration , monomers and some dimers are present . ( 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80 . ( 3 ) For anionics , these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups ( the ionized <head>ends</head> ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase . Obviously hydrophobic ( oleophilic ) substances such_as greases , oils , or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at_home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase . Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as_much_as approximately two-fold . Although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated , the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process .</context>

      <context> Freeman , Cameron and McGhie , in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard_to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation '' . In my experience , a great many_of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience . Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene . Recently , for_example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , developed itself , before the <head>end</head> of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was .

      <context> A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used_to often seclude herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door - as I would find on passing_by , between our sessions - for_all_the_world like two persons , a scolding mother and a defensive child . Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome . I have found , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior . For_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got_up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the <head>end</head> of each session . Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met . This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard_to the wishes of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy_chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair - in_short , behaving as if I owned her room .</context>

      <context> The first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world ; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change . For this period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; the ceramic material of the age is more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative_of the hopes and fears of its makers , who begin to show scenes of human life and death . Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece ; objects in gold , ivory , and bronze grow more numerous . Since writing was practiced in the Aegean before the <head>end</head> of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful . Though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the Iliad to any specific era , this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by 750 . The Dipylon_Geometric pottery of Athens and the Iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of Greek civilization ; but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending . Greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution , in which the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth .</context>

      <context> When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesized '' - into larger planar shapes themselves simply in_order to maintain the integrity of the picture_plane . Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut_away too abruptly into depth ; and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump_out of plane . Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to_the_extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) . It was because of this chain-reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_objects , or at_least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the <head>end</head> of 1913 . Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there . Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities . Synthetic_Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this was the_point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it .</context>

In this country , the two guiding_lights are , without_doubt , Felix_Fing and Anna_Pulova .</context>

      <context> For_example , when the film is only four minutes old , Neitzbohr refers to a small , Victorian piano_stool as `` Wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano_stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of_course , was Doris ( the English equivalent , when passed_through middle Gaelic derivations , of Wilhelmina ) . For the remainder of the movie , Chancellor_Neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano_stool with a slat from a Venetian_blind that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag . In this manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt_pangs caused by his personal assaults against the_English at Dunkirk . As we find_out at the <head>end</head> , it is not the stool ( symbolizing Doris , therefore the_English ) that he is punishing but the piece of Venetian_blind . And , when the slat finally shatters , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` He loves me , he loves me not '' . After a_few tortuous moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that Neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in_the_eyes_of a mute piece of sculpture . The effect , needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at_times a_bit obscure , the film is certainly a much needed catharsis for the `` repressed '' movie-goer .</context>
