      <context> The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took_over in the top of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee_Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning appearance , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into <head>left</head> . Whitey_Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base_on_balls . Then three consecutive pinch_hitters failed to produce . Pete_Ward was sent in_for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short .</context>

      <context> For we have said , in_effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative . If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' is clearly untenable . Whereas Bultmann 's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl_Barth , involves the rejection or at_least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered . It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` <head>left</head> '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . To do this , it is sufficient to point_out that if the principle in_terms_of which alternatives are to be conceived is such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question .</context>

      <context> One day Maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in_advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified . Rudyard_Kipling 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ? The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something_About_Myself . One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster_Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his <head>left</head> , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more_than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation_Of_Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' .</context>

      <context> His files , desk , drafting_board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos . Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , ten foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as_though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac . Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden_Cycly_Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller_skates which he occasionally used up_and_down front of his house . He worked standing , with his <head>left</head> hand in his pocket as_though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person 's hand . Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved . It all seemed - if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows - as_though this broken nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler 's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss 's work . This air of disengagement carried_over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine .</context>

      <context> `` You think the Russians are getting_ahead of us in comedy '' ? Moreland demanded . `` Non-God , no '' , I said . `` The political and intellectual <head>Left</head> began fighting humor and comedy years ago , because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage , such_as satire and irony , such_as humor and comedy . Nevertheless , like any other human_being upon whom the spotlight of the world plays continually , Khrushchev , the anti personality cultist , has become a comic actor , or thinks he has . In his famous meeting with Nixon a_couple_of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as Ed_Wynn . But , like Caesar , he has only one joke , so_far_as I can find_out .</context>
