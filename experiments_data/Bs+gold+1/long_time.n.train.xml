      <context> These are a great aid for planning use back at the office . For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry_through the study . However , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation . County judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and_others who have lived in the area for a <head>long_time</head> may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences . A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring_out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area . How much study is required ? This , of_course , depends_on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive_at a good decision .</context>

      <context> The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family_planning . Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed . Family_planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring . Pope_Pius_12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a <head>long_time</head> and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such_as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications '' . This means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring . These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics in family_planning . The laws of many states permit birth_control only for medical reasons .</context>

      <context> Can God be mocked , ever , in_the_long_run ? New_Englanders were a_bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration_of_Independence , as Jefferson explained in his `` Autobiography '' : `` The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck_out in complaisance to South_Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on_the_contrary still wished to continue it . Our Northern brethren also I believe felt a_little tender under those censures ; for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others '' . But that was a <head>long_time</head> ago . The New_England conscience became desensitized . George_W._Cable ( naturalized New_Englander ) , writing in 1889 from `` Paradise_Road , Northampton '' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the `` Southern question '' . It was nice to be able to isolate it .</context>

      <context> `` I 'll try '' . As Rector was walking back toward the residential hall , Johnson came_out of the basement and bounded up_to him . The altercation in the coffee_house had done little to dampen his spirits , but he was still a_little wary around Rector for they had not_yet discussed the incident . `` I think I 've fixed the pump so we won't have_to worry about it for a <head>long_time</head> '' , he said . `` I 've adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts_out before the water gets too low '' . `` Fine '' , Rector said . He looked out over the expanse of the compound .</context>

Too many times was the truth of_it , Winston thought .</context>

She had swished away , she had been gone for a <head>long_time</head> probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought_to stop her , pour_out the coffee , so no_one would drink it . But_then the so-called coffee was bad enough at_best , cold it was all_but undrinkable - especially that cup ! She was deeply , horribly sure that Lucien had filled it with opium . She had quarreled with Lucien , she had resisted his demands for money - and if she died , by the provisions of her marriage_contract , Lucien would inherit legally not_only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office , but later , when the war was over , her father 's entire estate .</context>

She studied it for a <head>long_time</head> . Then she turned_back to Wilson and smiled , and he was n't quite sure what she meant by it . `` You own this place '' ? she said , and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly . `` You bought it '' ?</context>

      <context> It poured out of him like an electric_current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine drawn body were coiling for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated . Joyce had seen him like this once before - more_than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion . That was the day that he had practically mopped_up the main_street of Big_Sands with Aaron_McBride , field boss for the Highlands_Oil_+_Gas_Company . Tom had been laying for Aaron_McBride for a <head>long_time</head> , just waiting to catch him out of line . McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed_up in town with a pistol on his hip . He had a legitimate reason for wearing it . It was payday for Highlands , and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil_fields .</context>

But they kept_on clapping for a long , long time . `` This time '' , Arlene said , and she even kept_on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking , `` you 're going_to tell me what I am and what I'm doing .
