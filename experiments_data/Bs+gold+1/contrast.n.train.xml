      <context> The citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot . Orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac . In a brighter nautical vein is Ile_de_France blue . <head>Contrast</head> trim provides other touches of color . Spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black , navy and taffy tan . Designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated . At the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light , but crisp texture .</context>

      <context> Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought_on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr._Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies . Interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney_General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke_off the flow . But there was a <head>contrast</head> even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and New_York . In each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin 's dictatorship ; in the United_States the initiation of militant anti Communism , with the repentant ex Communist in the vanguard . These trials were properly termed `` political cases '' in_that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences . But what could the Eichmann Trial initiate ?</context>

      <context> To swim is true , and to sink is true . One is not more true than the other . One cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess . When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a <head>contrast</head> between being and existence , they may be right , I do n't know , but their language is too philosophical for me . I am not a philosopher . One can only speak of what is in_front of him , and that now is simply the mess '' . Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form .</context>

      <context> Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be removed , and the detergent or surface-active material . An oversimplified differentiation between soft - and hard surface cleaning lies_in the magnitude and kind of surface involved . One gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface_area of * * f . In <head>contrast</head> , a metal coupon * * f in size would have a magnitude from 100000 to a_million less . Even here there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity . Spring used a Brush surface analyzer in a metal cleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending_upon surface roughness . There are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard surface cleaning .</context>

      <context> The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined . However , the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic considerations alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse . The volume and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse . Also , interlobular air drifts may be all_but nonexistent in the cow ; probably occur in the horse much_as in the human_being ; and , in <head>contrast</head> are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent ( Van_Allen and Lindskog , ' 31 ) . A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at_present . Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as_well . For_example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related_to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such_as those found in types 1 , and 3 , .</context>

      <context> Actual practice does not often work_out this way . Tone_systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal_systems . Welmers has suggested one explanation . Tone_languages use for linguistic <head>contrasts</head> speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use . This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable . The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features . Of_course , something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology : consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and an individual component .</context>
