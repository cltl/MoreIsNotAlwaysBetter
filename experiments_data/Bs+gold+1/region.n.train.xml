      <context> The detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils . The other constituents in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils . As_is well_known , detergent actives belong_to the chemical class consisting_of moderately high molecular_weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the property of forming micelles in solution . Physicochemical investigations of anionic surfactants , including the soaps , have shown that there is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain <head>region</head> of concentration called the critical micelle concentration . ( 1 ) Below the critical micelle concentration , monomers and some dimers are present . ( 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80 . ( 3 ) For anionics , these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups ( the ionized ends ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase .</context>

Obviously hydrophobic ( oleophilic ) substances such_as greases , oils , or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at_home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase . Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as_much_as approximately two-fold .</context>

      <context> In_addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain . From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal_light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane . Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component . The cores of deep sea sediments and content of collectors in remote <head>regions</head> are valuable in this category . The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth . The direct_evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the Earth is obtained from piezoelectric sensors ( essentially microphones ) and from wire gages ; these instruments are installed on rockets , satellites , and space_probes . Statistically , the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha ( Explorer_1 , ) , 1958 Delta_2 ( Sputnik 3 , ) , and 1959 Eta ( Vanguard 3 , ) .</context>

      <context> Successive 1 - ml fractions were then drawn off with a hypodermic_syringe , starting at the top of the tube , and tested for agglutinin activity . Other methods will be described below . The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting_buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity , regardless of the blood_group of the donor . With either of the gradients described , chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated agglutinins of the ABO series into at_least three <head>regions</head> ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) : one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity . These have been labeled Regions 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in Fig. 1 . When the early part of the gradient was flattened , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` cone sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P._J. and R._S. , Fig. 1 and E._M. , Fig. 2 ) .</context>

      <context> To summarize the purpose of the Skeletal Maturity Chart : each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level of growth centers . First , the upper portion requires series of films for every child , consisting_of those from Hand , Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , and Foot . The lower portion necessitates only films of Hand . Second , the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round_bones of the five <head>regions</head> . The lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round_bones predominantly , since only two long_bones are included in Hand and Wrist as a region . Third , the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level , Onset and Completion . The lower portion utilizes the full_complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as_well_as their Onset and Completion .</context>

      <context> An inquest was held , and after a good_deal of testimony about the anonymous notes , the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards . Rumors of the offer Tom_Horn had made at the Stockgrowers'_Association meeting had leaked_out by then , and as a grand_jury investigation of the murder got underway , the prosecuting_attorney , a Colonel_Baird , ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning . It took some time to locate Horn . He was finally found in the Bates_Hole <head>region</head> of Natrona_County , two counties away . Prosecutor_Baird immediately assumed he was hiding_out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment . But that indictment was never made . For Tom_Horn , it turned_out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight_faces that he had been in Bates_Hole the day of the killing .</context>

      <context> Apart from journalese and vaudeville gags , the anatomical is also found in jocular literature . A conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor . Her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor 's notes on an emergency case . It read : `` Shot in the lumbar <head>region</head> '' . After a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she typed into the record : `` Shot in the woods '' . There are many grammatical misconstructions other_than dangling_modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations . At the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving .</context>
