      <context> Everything from poetry to phonetics , history to histrionics , philosophy to party_games has been adapted to the turntable . For sheer ambition , take the Decca series titled modestly `` Wisdom '' . Volumes One and Two , selected from the sound_tracks of a television series , contain `` conversations with the elder wise_men of our day '' . These sages include poet Carl_Sandburg , statesman Jawaharlal_Nehru and sculptor Jacques_Lipchitz , in Volume One , and playwright Sean_O'Casey , David_Ben-Gurion , philosopher Bertrand_Russell and the late Frank_Lloyd_Wright in the second <head>set</head> . Hugh_Downs is heard interviewing Wright , for an added prestige fillip . There 's more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by Dover_Publications . Dover `` publishes '' what the company calls `` Listen_and_Learn '' productions designed to teach foreign languages .</context>

      <context> Enthusiastically , Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul_Bunyan tales , Abe_Lincoln anecdotes and labor_union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition . Nor have we remembered that in the melting_pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material . Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or <head>set</head> of situations is irrelevant . As_long_as his material is Americana , can in_some_way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied . From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth century American folklore . On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought_out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make_up this nation .</context>

A <head>set</head> of tables containing spectral intensities for 39000 lines of 70 elements , as observed in a copper matrix in a d-c arc , was completed and published .

      <context> Phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity , possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system . Tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone . The possibilities are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater . Often , therefore , there are a number of rules having the same effect , and commonly other <head>sets</head> of rules as_well , having the opposite effect . Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics , even when the total number of rules is no greater . The difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology is an inverse_function of the size - smaller systems are more troublesome - for any given degree of morphophonemic complexity .
