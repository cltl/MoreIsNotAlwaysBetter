      <context> His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let_alone educate them in a town without even a school . The two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish . Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum . Oldenburg 's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn_to a wider <head>circle</head> of the town 's learned , such_as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching . From the town surveyor , Hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university_student , some academic subjects . The mayor of the town taught them English and French . Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed_on to each other ; they read every book that they could borrow in the village .</context>

      <context> The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members . The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations . There is much talk in theological <head>circles</head> about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation .</context>

      <context> This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement . Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism . I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North . In business <head>circles</head> , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found . But in our case - and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts - the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come_close to wrecking several more . In_fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down . Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up_against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .</context>

Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up_against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view . But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee hatred displayed in social gatherings . From my wife 's experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated <head>circles</head> . The strong feeling is certainly there ; but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South , especially among those who studied in the North . And social_relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting Northerners . Also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems .</context>

      <context> The Szolds , like the Marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ; and , as in the March home , any young_man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them . This included Mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell_in_love , just as Papa had first fallen_in_love with her Mamma before he chose her ; and when a young_man like Morris_Jastrow had enjoyed the Szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold girls and Mamma . And just as `` Laurie '' Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo_March , who found him immature by her high standards , and_then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy , so Joe_Jastrow , who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns_Hopkins , had_to content himself with her younger sister , pretty Rachel . And like Jo_March , who saw her sisters Meg and Amy involved in `` lovering '' before herself , Henrietta saw her sisters Rachel and Sadie drawn outside their family <head>circle</head> by the attraction of suitors , Rachel by Joe_Jastrow , and Sadie by Max_Lobl , a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat down the Mississippi .</context>

      <context> His orthographic recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on_the_one_hand or of superficiality on the other . Rather he weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness . He concludes that some changes can made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness , but hesitates to suggest precise graphic devices to effect these changes . I hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu <head>circles</head> . This , however , will not exhaust their practical usefulness , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design . We need many_more studies of this sort if the design of written_languages is to be put on a sound basis . One other paper deals with a phonologic problem :</context>

      <context> Of_course it had always been of European origin in_fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural_law theory . Now , with virtually every writer , not_only was the European origin of public_law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others . The European customs on which international_law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states . Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the <head>circle</head> of law governed countries . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states .</context>

      <context> - he had_to play a role of self-effacement . Back_and_forth Duclos had_to go , between M._de_Cury and Jean_Jacques and between the Duke_d'Aumont and Jean_Jacques again , as his little operetta , The_Village_Soothsayer , though still unperformed , took_on ever more importance . And of_course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get_around among his closest friends . But they , naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at_large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court <head>circles</head> . How titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals . The furor was such_that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational . And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe , Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration , trembling lest his authorship become known , and at_the_same_time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer .</context>

      <context> Immediately after dinner , however , Rousseau asks for still another favor . Could he have pen and paper , please ? He is in a hurry to write another essay against culture . Such was the impromptu that Voltaire gave to howls of laughter at Sans_Souci and that was soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary <head>circles</head> of Europe , to be printed sometime later , but with the name of Timon_of_Athens , the famous misanthrope , substituted for that of Rousseau . How cruel ! But at_the_same_time how understandable . How could the rich , for whom life was made so simple , ever understand the subterfuges , the lies , the frauds , the errors , sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life ?</context>

      <context> The two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team . All_of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could . They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually . He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid <head>circles</head> against a cumulus sky . Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run_up her sails . The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay .
