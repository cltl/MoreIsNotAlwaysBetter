      <context> Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick - several every Saturday , in_fact - out of football . Moritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip_pads but he 's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the cotton_bowl . That 's because he already has kicked 14 extra_points in 15 tries . He ran his <head>string</head> of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41 - 8 slaughter of Washington_State . Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . But ask coach Darrell_Royal what position he plays and you 'll get the quick response , `` place_kicker '' . A 208 - pound , 6 - foot 1 - inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking .</context>

      <context> Arnold sent_for Joe_Dey , the executive_secretary of the golf association . Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . `` I knew it all_along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . For a serious young_man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense_of_humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo <head>strings</head> . Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . He 'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he 's right . That 's how he first won the Masters in 1958 .</context>

      <context> The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives . About the Pro_Arte 's contribution I am less happy . I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group . From a technical standpoint , the <head>string</head> playing is good , but the Pro_Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here . The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy . The twenty-five year old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet . There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is_due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs .</context>

      <context> She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty legged escritoire , warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea_spray . There she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote_off the letters , one to Abel , one to Mark . Once her trembling hand , with the pen grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper the words came sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips . And the stiffly regal look of them , she saw grimly , lacked the quaver of age which , thwarting the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken_words like a thin ragged <head>string</head> . `` Please come_down as_soon_as you conveniently can '' , the upright letters stalked from the broad nibbed pen , `` I have an important matter to discuss with you '' . To Abel : `` I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here .</context>

      <context> She brought_up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker . He side-stepped her blow and she fell , stumbling against the gelding . She finally regained her balance and got_up in the saddle . Her hat had come_off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the <head>string</head> , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before . He had forgotten that she was so pretty . But her prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : cruelty , meanness , self-will .</context>
