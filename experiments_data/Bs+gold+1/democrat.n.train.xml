      <context> It is these other differences between North and South - other , that_is , than those which concern discrimination or social_welfare - which I chiefly discuss herein . I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience . A Southerner married to a New_Englander , I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity_men , and business_executives of egghead tastes . Most_of them are <head>Democrats</head> and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed_as , liberals . This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government . Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron_saints . When I question them as_to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall_into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things do n't count any_more in the world of to-day .</context>
