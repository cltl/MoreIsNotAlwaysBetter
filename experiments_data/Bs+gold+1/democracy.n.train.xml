      <context> Most_of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed_as , liberals . This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government . Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron_saints . When I question them as_to what they mean by concepts like liberty and <head>democracy</head> , I find that they fall_into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things do n't count any_more in the world of to-day . I am naive , they say , to make use of such words . I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? - liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as_well_as democratic processes may have to yield before it .</context>

      <context> Why should this be so ? It is true that New_England , more_than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start . But I think that something more than this is involved . How did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of American <head>democracy</head> , failed to flourish in New_England as it did in other parts of the country ? Is n't it a_bit odd that the three states of Southern New_England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode_Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A_+_M_colleges ? Was it supposed , perchance , that A_+_M ( vocational_training , that_is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant_class which flooded that part of the New_England world in the post Civil_War period , the immigrants having been brought_in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make_up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ? Is it not ironical that Roger_Williams 's state , Rhode_Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ?</context>

      <context> What I want to point_out here is that all_of them are ex liberals , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception . I suppose we might classify Billy_Graham as an old liberal . And I would further note that they all - with one exception again - sang in one key or another the same song . Its refrain was : `` Let us return to the individualistic <head>democracy</head> of our forefathers for our salvation '' . Adlai_Stevenson expressed some reservations about this return . Others invoked technology and common_sense . Only Walter_Lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most_of what we used_to regard_as the program of our national purposes '' .</context>

      <context> Postmaster_General Burleson set_about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails . Attorney_General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more_than 4000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights . Then , not many years later , the Un-American_Activities_Committee , under the leadership of Martin_Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens . Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of <head>democracy</head> was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government . This hysteria reached its height under the leadership of Senator_Joseph_McCarthy . Demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions . New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no_matter_how .</context>
