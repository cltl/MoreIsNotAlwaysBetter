      <context> A 6 - year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed . This project was carried_out under sponsorship of the Ballistic_Missile_Division_of_the_Air_Research_and_Development_Command , U._S._Air_Force , and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat_energy of chemical binding . A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more_than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region . Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the <head>oxygen</head> when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present . The results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1000 to 10000 * * f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from * * f to * * f times normal density . In March , 1961 , representatives of the national laboratories of Australia , Canada , The_Netherlands , United_Kingdom , U._S._S._R. , United_States , and West_Germany , met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 * * f . As a first_step toward this goal , arrangements were worked_out for comparing the scales now in_use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance_thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory .</context>

      <context> Under the sponsorship of the Office_of_Naval_Research and the Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency , a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities . An exhaustive survey was made of the literature , and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued . Selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation . A wall stabilized high current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and <head>oxygen</head> . This apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large_number of other elements . A study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about * * f percent . A set of tables containing spectral intensities for 39000 lines of 70 elements , as observed in a copper matrix in a d-c arc , was completed and published .</context>

      <context> However , any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short **f interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non hydrogen_bonded **f interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 A . Hence it is difficult to conceive_of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence . The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen_atoms to occupy general , rather_than special , positions along the [ 111 ] axis . If the **f bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen_atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen_atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the <head>oxygen</head> sheets ; ( 2 ) all hydrogen_atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ( 3 ) hydrogen_atoms are asymmetrically placed , either randomly or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen_atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms . Position ( 2 ) appears to us to be unlikely in_view_of the absence of a piezoelectric_effect and on general chemical structural grounds . A randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen_atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit_cell , for which no evidence exists .

      <context> The fraction of exchange was determined as the ratio of the counts / minute observed in the carbon_tetrachloride to the counts / minute calculated for the carbon_tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon_tetrachloride , empirically determined correction being made for the difference in counting efficiency of * * f in * * f and * * f . In studying the liquid phase thermal reaction , some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were prepared and analyzed . Experiments were done at 180 , 200 , 210 , 220 ` . Following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per_cent , a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine , to the effects of <head>oxygen</head> or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes . In_addition to the method described in the section above , chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared by the electrolysis of a * * f eutectic on the vacuum line , and by exchange of * * f with molten * * f . Calcium_hydride was substituted for * * f as a drying_agent for carbon_tetrachloride . No correlation between these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found .</context>

Sets of reaction tubes containing 0.2 of an atmosphere of added <head>oxygen</head> in one case and added moisture in another , both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine exchanged per hour . No detectable reaction was found at room_temperature for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up_to 5 hours .

      <context> By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation_energies ranging from 11 to 18 * * f was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases . It was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of reduction of a uranyl_oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions based on the differences in the absorption_spectra of uranyl_oxalate and of chlorine , and considering the spectral distribution of the light source . These estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon_tetrachloride at 65 ` is of the order_of_magnitude of unity . When typical reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of <head>oxygen</head> had been added were illuminated , chlorine and phosgene were produced . Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at * * f . Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical_exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon_tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate . Data on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in Table /1 .</context>

      <context> The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial_artery as found in the horse is not clear . However , this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung . The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues . Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required <head>oxygen</head> either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , ' 13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , ' 58 ) . Therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial_artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus . If this be true , the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial_arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema . One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1 , or 2 , .</context>

      <context> Examination of the data in Table 1 , shows that a_few samples contributed to raising the effluent BOD .

The slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow_down and reduce <head>oxygen</head> transfer as_well_as the mixing of the raw sewage . The organic loading on the unit averaged 32 lb of BOD / day or about 2 lb BOD / day 1000 cu_ft aeration capacity .

Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of <head>oxygen</head> / hr / hp . O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes . They indicated that a 4 - day retention , aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 per_cent BOD reduction . Later , Eckenfelder increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per_cent in the summer months .</context>

      <context> The data given in Table 2 , show the routine operation of the aerator . The dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until January 29 , 1961 . An extended cold_spell caused ice to build_up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water . The added resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the <head>oxygen</head> transfer capacity . It was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and corrected , but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen . A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate . Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover .</context>

      <context> The pond is currently serving 1230 persons or 260 persons per acre . In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors . It was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond by regular additions of sodium_nitrate until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green to green_algae . The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional <head>oxygen</head> than by sodium_nitrate . At_the_same_time further expansion in the Red_Bridge_Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities . The large land_areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer . It was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development .</context>
