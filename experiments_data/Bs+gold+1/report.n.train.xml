      <context> Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman_Catholics '' , and have done so . While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population_shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going_to church . It should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics ( one paper writes 50 per_cent ) . Still , it is clear from such <head>reports</head> , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing . An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true . A century ago , Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English_Protestantism , and that even high_Anglicanism would someday no_longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own '' . That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' .</context>

      <context> From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all_but empty during services . A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city_university , following Anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated Mass before more_than a_hundred . The Protestants themselves are the first to admit the great falling_off in effective membership in their churches . According_to a newspaper <head>report</head> of the 1961 statistics of the Church_of_England , the `` total of confirmed members is 9748000 , but only 2887671 are registered on the parochial church_rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church_of_England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' . An amazing article in the Manchester_Guardian of last November , entitled `` Fate of Redundant Churches '' , states than an Archbishops ' Commission `` reported last month that in the Church_of_England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years ' time . A further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 '' . And in the last five years , the `` Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels '' .</context>

      <context> New_England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as_well_as West . They may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns_out to be from Thailand , or any place other_than the American South . It would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep_schools of New_England . A recent newspaper <head>report</head> said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating_class of nearly one_thousand at Yale ; that_is , about one-half of one per_cent , which looks pretty `` tokenish '' to me , especially in an institution which professes to be `` national '' . I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith . I leave_out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are . I 'm talking_about the grand manner of the Liberal - North and South - who is not affected personally .</context>

      <context> The data show daily and diurnal_variations . Ninety per_cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order_of_magnitude . One may conclude that most_of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the Earth 's orbit . There have been contradictory <head>reports</head> from 1958 Delta_2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable . On May 15 , a very large increase occurred with * * f of mass between * * f and * * f ; for the next two days , the impact rate was * * f ; and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less_than * * f ( Nazarova , 1960 ) . The data for the first day indicate a meteor_stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux . Preliminary data from 1959_Eta give an average impact rate of * * f for masses larger than * * f for about 1000 events in a 22 - day period ( LaGow and Alexander , 1960 ) .</context>

      <context> There are three levels on which to treat the subject . The first is the strictly scientific , which demands concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in_the_flesh . This approach rejects virtually all field measurements . The next level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced , sensible conclusion ; field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected , and even <head>reports</head> of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated . The third level leans_on a belief that a_lot of smoke means some fire . The argument against this last approach is comparable_to that which rejects stories about hoop_snakes , about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again , or even of ghosts that chase people out of graveyards ; the mere piling_up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of hoop_snakes , joint_snakes , or ghosts . Oliver has recently used the second level approach with the largest snakes , and has come to these conclusions :</context>
