      <context> However , in all of Prokofieff 's music , young or mature , we find his profile - his `` signature '' - his craftsman 's attitude . Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per_se . In orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color . His <head>sense</head> for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable . His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle . His counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick . Also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured_bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required .</context>

      <context> If the fourth_dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? It is not through space nor time that the time_machine most approved by science_fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever existent past fantasy future . Three seconds flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events . The body , <head>senses</head> and brain , in_common_with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies . The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them . Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions . When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep .</context>

      <context> A Floridian stated that his officers were `` not fit to tote_guts_to_a_bear '' . On December 9 , 1862 , Sergeant_Edwin_H._Fay , an unusual Louisianan who held A._B. and M._A. degrees from Harvard_University and who before the war was headmaster of a private_school for boys in Louisiana , wrote his wife : `` I saw Pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw . His head cannot contain enough <head>sense</head> to command a regiment , much less a corps . Jackson runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader . He is not worth shucks . But he is a West_Point graduate and therefore must be born to command '' .</context>

      <context> Apparently the population as_a_whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears . How and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study . In some areas , the progress is slower than in others . In agriculture , for_example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued <head>sense</head> of the imminence of some natural disaster . In child_care , the opposite extreme prevails ; procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory . There are many domains in which understanding has brought_about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear . Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared .</context>

      <context> It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by <head>sense</head> '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins ' pronouncement in Pleas_of_the_Crown from a metaphysical point_of_view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married_couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such_that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal_law as if there were no marriage . By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself .</context>

      <context> It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble , solid , and limited basis . I would propose , first , an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved . I would propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible . There would be no conceivable <head>sense</head> in going_to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable . An attempted middle course might lead to devices like a 5000 - word alphabetized dictionary from which every fiftieth word was selected .</context>

      <context> Consider what follows from the positivist view . On that view , nothing good or bad happened in the case until I came_on the scene and made my remark . For what I express in my remark is something going_on in me at the time , and that of_course did not exist until I did come_on the scene . The pain of the rabbit was not itself bad ; nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured ; badness , in the only <head>sense</head> in which it is involved at_all , waited for its appearance till I came and looked and felt . Now that this is at_odds with our meaning may be shown as_follows . Let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come_on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered . Are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did ?</context>

      <context> `` Did n't occur to me my child would be kidnaped when I had it listed '' , Andrus muttered . He settled_on the sofa with his coffee , warming his hands on the cup , although the room was heavy with heat . The three had little to say to each other . The previous night 's horror - the absolute failure , overcast with the intrusions of the press , had left them all with a wan <head>sense</head> of uselessness , of play-acting . Sipping their coffee , discussing the weather , the day 's shopping , Fritzie 's commitments at the network ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoided the radio , the morning TV news_show , even the front page of the Santa_Luisa_Register , resting on the kitchen bar . Kidnapper Spurns Ransom ; Amy Still Missing . Once , Andrus walked by it , hastily scanned the bold black headline and the five column lead of the article ( by Duane_Bosch , staff correspondent - age not given ) , and muttered : `` We a buncha national celebrities '' .</context>

      <context> He thought : Where the hell could he have gone ? How can I find him ? There was no answer to this and he began to pace back_and_forth across the room , his imagination out of control . He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton had sobered_up enough to get some <head>sense</head> . Maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer , whoever he was , in_which_case an unloaded gun would be good_enough . He thought_of other possibilities , none of them satisfactory , and finally he began to think , to wonder if there was some way he could reach Burton . Then , as he turned toward the telephone , it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly .</context>
