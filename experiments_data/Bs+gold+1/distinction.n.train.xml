      <context> The Orioles tonight retained the <head>distinction</head> of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League_clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas_City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . Indications as_late_as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory drought as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage . Over the first five frames , Jack_Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in_the_middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American_League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick_Hyde , submarine_ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock .</context>

      <context> The principal speaker will be Senator_Stuart_Symington , Democrat of Missouri . Arnold_Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months . He won the Masters , the United_States_Open and a record $ 80738 in prize_money . He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports_Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional_Athlete_of_the_Year '' , a <head>distinction</head> that earned for him the $ 10000 diamond - studded Hickok_Belt . But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . A_couple_of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par 5 hole . It made him human .</context>

      <context> He injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years . He may respect too_much the Italian tradition of letting singers hold_on to their notes , but to restrain them in a singers ' opera may be quite difficult . Richard_Tucker sang Edgardo in glorious voice . His bel_canto style gave the performance a special <head>distinction</head> . The remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more_than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage_direction proved only serviceable . Miss_Sutherland first sang Lucia at Covent_Garden in 1959 . ( The first Metropolitan_Opera broadcast on Dec. 9 will introduce her as Lucia . )</context>

      <context> Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation . The music is always allowed the living_space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi performer . The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance . All_of this would be wasted , of_course , if the performance lacked authority and musical <head>distinction</head> . For me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors . Steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms set_down on_paper . Those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one .</context>

      <context> Artur_Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable . But Schnabel was a great teacher in_addition_to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford_Curzon , Frank_Glazer , Adrian_Aeschbacher , and Victor_Babin ) also sheds_light_on the master 's pedagogical skills . Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in_that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) . But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel 's <head>distinction</head> as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student 's approach as distinctly his own . Schnabel 's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one . Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .</context>

      <context> In_the_first_place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale . Robert_Frost , for_instance , writes about rural life in New_England , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems . This has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk_poet '' , simply because he is a rural one . In the second place , a large_number of writers , making a more direct claim than Frost to being `` folk_writers '' of one sort or another , clearly make no <head>distinctions</head> between genuine and bogus material . Stephen_Vincent_Benet 's John_Brown's_Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John_Steinbeck 's The_Grapes_of_Wrath and Carl_Sandburg 's The_People,_Yes . The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass . Folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it .</context>

      <context> Observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion . This behavior is more `` veridical '' - or true than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning . While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure . The objective of this chapter is to clarify the <head>distinctions</head> between spontaneity theory and other training concepts . In_addition , the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed . The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area . The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold :</context>

      <context> I think you could have heard him a mile away , and he was bursting at every seam with importance . I have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man , and when a very small man is up on a saddle , he 'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there . That 's understandable , and I appreciate the sentiment . As for this rider , I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted , so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes , I can n't say ; but I do know that he gave the day tone and <head>distinction</head> . The last thing in_the_world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone_wall , and this dashing rider made us feel a good_deal sharper and more alert to the situation . We came_down off the wall as if he had toppled all_of us , and we crouched behind it . I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars , but that only proves that a_lot of people talk_about things of which they are deplorably ignorant .</context>
