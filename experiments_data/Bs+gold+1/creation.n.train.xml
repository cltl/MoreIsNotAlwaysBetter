      <context> The Senate quickly whipped_through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar . One validated acts of school districts . Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont_Navigation_District . The third amended the enabling_act for <head>creation</head> of the Lamar_county Hospital_District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted . Without dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen._A._R._Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally_retarded in the Gulf_Coast district . Money for its construction will be sought later_on but in_the_meantime the State_Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site . Two tax revision bills were passed .</context>

      <context> If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator . This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced . If death receives more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through Christ begins to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence . Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of <head>creation</head> ; for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history . Because Christianity teaches not_only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of Christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ .</context>

      <context> Thus the image of God is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster ; the similitude of God , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature . Recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction . He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as_well_as of mortality . Therefore Irenaeus describes man 's <head>creation</head> as_follows : `` So_that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted_up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take_up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all . And He laid_down for him certain conditions : so_that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' . These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result .</context>

      <context> Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather_than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing . Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free_rein . Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate <head>creation</head> . In these readings , the double_bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown 's attire - the musical equivalent of a bull_in_a_china_shop . Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances . The occasion for this marathon : Angel 's long awaited reissue in its `` Great_Recordings_of_the_Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro_Arte version .</context>

      <context> In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as_well_as a mechanical recording device . He did more than that . He revealed the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film . Cutting , of_course , takes_place automatically in the <head>creation</head> of a film . The meaning of the word is quite physical , to_begin_with . The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence . If , as a home_movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event .</context>

      <context> He points_out that from the time of Jackson on through World_War_1 , , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America . He terms this early enthusiasm `` Romantic_Christianity '' and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of_that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical Protestantism '' . Let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme . He says : `` Beside the Protestant philosophy of Progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the United_States to assist in the <head>creation</head> of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy '' . He specifies , `` In the middle period of the Nineteenth Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism , in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism . But in every period it has been humanism '' . And let me add , utopianism , also .</context>

      <context> Religion usually exercises a stabilizing conserving function . As_such it acts_as an anchor for the people . There is a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change , not_only in their own doctrines and policies and practices , but also in secular affairs having religious relevance . It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the <head>creation</head> or diffusion of new ones . It tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments , the traditional ways of thinking , and the customary ways of living . As Yinger has pointed_out , the `` reliance on symbols , on tradition , on sacred_writings , on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turns one to the past far more than to the future '' . Historically , religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication , enforcement , sanction , and perpetuation of various other institutions .</context>

      <context> Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law . Indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific . In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliament - the elected representatives - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary . When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit - when norms were clarified and made more precise and the <head>creation</head> of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands - two purposes were served : Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law became a rational system for implementing that will , for serving conscious goals , for embodying the `` public policy '' . It is true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , inhibited the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy . Law was seen as an emanation of the `` sovereign will '' . However , the sovereign was not Hobbes ' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin .</context>
