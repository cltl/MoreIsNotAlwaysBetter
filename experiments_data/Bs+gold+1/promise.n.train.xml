      <context> During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone_calls . Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election . Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election . Sheriff_Felix_Tabb said the ordinary apparently made_good his <head>promise</head> . `` Everything went real smooth '' , the sheriff said . `` There was n't a_bit of trouble '' .</context>

      <context> And He laid_down for him certain conditions : so_that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' . These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result . There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) . Man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil 's <head>promise</head> of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality . He was , in the words of Irenaeus , `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality '' . The true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this . `` Eve was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as_yet she was a virgin .</context>

      <context> The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics . Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence . They were stressed in the speeches of Si_Mubarak_Bekkai when the first Council_of_Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council . King_Muhammad /5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm <head>promise</head> of elections on May_Day , 1957 . There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister_of_the_Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less_than enthusiastic . Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the_French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious . From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government .</context>

      <context> In November 1900 surveying was done under John_Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power_plant . Nothing came of it , perhaps due_to lack of opportunity for water storage . The next step was construction by the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company of a plant on the west bank of the Battenkill south of Union_Street bridge . This was nearly completed May 23 , 1901 with a <head>promise</head> of lights by June 10 , but the first light did not go_on until September 28 . It was at the end of the sidewalk in_front of the Dellwood_Cemetery cottage . The first directors of the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company were John_Marsden , M._L._Manley , William_F._Orvis , George_Smith , and John_Blackmer . The officers were John_Marsden , president ; John_C._Blackmer , vice-president ; George_Smith , treasurer ; and William_F._Orvis , secretary .</context>

      <context> Nothing in_all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world . In final separation from them , in the railroad_terminal across the river from New_York , I would nearly cry . My parents ' welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted . But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave <head>promise</head> of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or mess-hall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond . These letters became the center of my existence . I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer . My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when '' ; and_others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commencing again her piano_lessons , her private_school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe .</context>

      <context> Sol_Phillips had purchased the Alliance_Furniture_Mart seventeen years ago . It was professedly worth three thousand dollars in stock and good_will , and the name was written in gold in foot high letters across each of the two display_windows . On the right window , at eye level , in smaller print but also in gold , was Gonzalez , Prop. , and under_that , Se_Habla_Espanol . Mr._Phillips took a razor to Gonzalez , Prop. , but left the <head>promise</head> that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele would be welcome . Language was no problem anyway ; Mr._Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of Mission_Street . Aside from the fact that business was slow this time_of_year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising , Mr._Phillips had no worries at_all , and he said as much to Gun_Matson , who sat across from him in civilian clothes , on a Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed , mauve velour , $ 79.89 nothing down special ! `` She 's honest_as_the_day '' , Mr._Phillips said , and added , `` Mr._Gunnar , I can say this to you : Beebe is a_little too honest .</context>
