      <context> H._E._Bates has scribbled a farce called `` Hark_,_Hark_,_the_Lark '' ! It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season . If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find . Perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare_state in <head>England</head> still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics . Anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions . One is an imperial London stockbroker called Jerebohm . Another is a wily countryman called Larkin , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled , I believe , in earlier volumes of Mr._Bates ' comedie_humaine .</context>

      <context> Still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing . An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true . A century ago , Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English_Protestantism , and that even high_Anglicanism would someday no_longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own '' . That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call <head>England</head> a `` Protestant country '' . One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite . Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy . The London_Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping_out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one_hundred years .</context>

      <context> I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics . It has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses at Mass . They hope , of_course , to reclaim the non-Catholic population to the Catholic faith , and at every Sunday Benediction they recite by_heart the `` Prayer_for_England '' : `` O Blessed Virgin_Mary , Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon <head>England</head> , thy '' dowry `` , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee . Intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief Shepherd , the vicar of thy Son '' . A hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is `` Faith_of_our_Fathers '' , which glories in England 's ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims : `` Faith of our Fathers : Mary 's prayers / Shall win our country back to thee '' .</context>

      <context> Now again in 1961 , in England , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity . The Church_Unity_Octave , January 18 - 25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches . Many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 . But it must be readily seen that the religious picture in <head>England</head> has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at_least on the Catholic side . For `` the_tide_is_well_on_the_turn '' , as the London_Catholic_weekly_Universe has written . I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal_Newman . As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated country .</context>

      <context> Because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , English Catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being `` English '' . I have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in_the_air . For_example , a writer in a recent number of The_Queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un English '' ' . In this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics , priests and laity , in <head>England</head> , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics , especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good . One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken_place since the mid 19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge_Universities . At Oxford one_hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 . Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs .</context>

This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per_cent after February 1835 , but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per_cent on the initiative of the London committee .</context>

It was Dickson who suggested to Lord_Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United_States . In September 1817 at Fort_Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of Sioux , he escorted to Prairie_du_Chien . During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United_States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red_River and that the United_States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or <head>England</head> .

      <context> In some countries the trend has gone further than others : Mexico , Panama , and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism , and there is no country - save the Dominican_Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged - where Castroism and anti Americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause . Only in Europe have our lines remained_firm - and there only on the surface . The strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in <head>England</head> , and even in Germany . What have we to show by_way_of counter successes ? We have had opportunities - clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron_Curtain . There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about .</context>

      <context> Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South_Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North_Carolina , and Alabama following along after them . Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; so_that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper_limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old_South from the new , but with , of_course , important minority enclaves . The long settled areas of states like Virginia and South_Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater . Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such_as the coastal lowlands centering_on Charleston had closer ties with <head>England</head> and the West_Indies than with the North even after independence . The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area . In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old_South . Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no_longer any hope of sharing_in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother_country .</context>

      <context> In every war of the United_States since the Civil_War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country . So instead of being tests of the South 's loyalty , the Spanish_War , the two World_Wars , and the Korean_War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion . And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold_war against Communism . Had the situation been reversed , had , for_instance , <head>England</head> been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New_England , there is little doubt that large_numbers of Southerners would have happily put_on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain . It is extraordinary that a_people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have . The North should thank_its_stars that such has been the case ; but at_the_same_time it should not draw false inferences therefrom . The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .</context>

      <context> Hercule_Poirot and Lord_Peter_Whimsey ( the respective creations of Agatha_Christie and Dorothy_Sayers ) have retained Holmes ' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits . Poirot and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people ; it is true that they are also extremely dull . Their dedication to the status_quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a Sherlock_Holmes . The latter 's real descendents were unable to take_root in <head>England</head> ; they fled from the Victorian parlor and made their way across the stormy Atlantic . In the American `` hardboiled '' detective_story of the ' 20 s and ' 30 s , the spirit of the mad genius from Baker_Street lives on . Like Holmes , the American private_eye rejects the social conventions of his time . But unlike Holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt .</context>

      <context> But was he infallible in all things ? What of his treatment of the Jew in The_Merchant_of_Venice ? Shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of Shylock , but probably he never saw a Jew , unless in some of his travels . The Jews had been banished from <head>England</head> in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 , when Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years . If any had escaped expulsion by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place . Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays , but borrowed them from old stories , ballads , and plays , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark of life . Rather than from a first-hand study of Jewish people , his delineation of Shylock stems from a collection of Italian stories , Il_Pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier .</context>

      <context> By her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that Papa and Mamma gave her a Life_of_Dickens as a spur to her aspiration . Another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of Johns_Hopkins_University within walking distance of home . It was established in a_couple_of buildings in the shopping district , with only a_few professors , but all eminent men , and a_few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings . In September ' 76 Thomas_Huxley , Darwin 's famous disciple , came from <head>England</head> to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the University ; and although it was a school for men only , it afforded Henrietta an opportunity to attend its public_lectures . In the following year her father undertook to give a course in Hebrew theology to Johns_Hopkins students , and this brought to the Szold house a group of bright young Jews who had come to Baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma and entertained by Henrietta and Rachel , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting_room on Sunday evenings . From Philadelphia came Cyrus_Adler and Joseph_Jastrow . Adler , Judge_Sulzberger 's nephew , came to study Assyriology .</context>

      <context> But let us return , after this gruesome interlude , to our willow catkins in the spring ; there are other wild bees that command our attention . It is almost certain that some of these , usually a_trifle smaller than the honeybees , are andrenas or mining_bees . There are about 200 different kinds of Andrena in Europe alone . One of my favorites is A._armata , a species very common in <head>England</head> , where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee . The females like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawns , where their little mounds of earth often appear by the hundreds . Almost equal in size to a honeybee . A._armata is much more beautiful in color , at_least in the female of the species : a rich , velvety , rusty red .</context>

      <context> Law became a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking_to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms . Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no_longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed . The old way of doing things , which depended_on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no_longer adequate_to the task . First was the period of codification of existing law : the Code_Napoleon in France and the peculiar codification that , in_fact , resulted from Austin 's restatement and ordering of the Common_Law in <head>England</head> . Codification was followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation , some changing and adjusting the older law , much dealing with entirely new situations . The legislative mills have been grinding ever since , and when its cumbersome processes were no_longer adequate_to the task , a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another , to the executive . Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law .</context>
