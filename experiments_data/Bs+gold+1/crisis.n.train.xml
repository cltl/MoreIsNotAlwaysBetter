      <context> Of only one could he be sure - young John_Hudson , his second son . The mate , Robert_Juet , who had kept the journal on the half_Moon , was experienced - but he was a bitter old_man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity . Philip_Staffe , the ship 's carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent . Arnold_Lodley and Michael_Perse were like the rest - lukewarm , ready to swing against Hudson in a <head>crisis</head> . But men willing to sail at_all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find . Hudson knew he had to use these men as_long_as he remained an explorer . And he refused to be anything else .</context>

      <context> It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine . After_all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control . Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement . Such identification comes for each group in each <head>crisis</head> by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes . In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose . A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever_changing land . But we must never forget , most_of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends .</context>

      <context> Even so astute a commentator as Harold_Clurman of The Nation has said that `` Waiting_for_Godot '' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair '' . But to me Beckett 's writing had seemed permeated with love for human_beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism . Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ? Is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social <head>crises</head> we face ? Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ? I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing : in_the_last_analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself . Nevertheless I was curious .</context>

      <context> Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each_day has increased tremendously since World_War_2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957 . Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New_York_City area . Here the New_York_Central_Railroad , one of the Nation 's most important carriers , has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949 . At this time of <head>crisis</head> in our Nation 's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New_York_Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake_+_Ohio_Railroad 's proposal for control of the Baltimore_+_Ohio_railroads . The New_York_Central has pointed_out that this control , if approved by the Interstate_Commerce_Commission , would give the combined C.+O. - B.+O._Railroad a total of 185 points served in_common with the New_York_Central . Not_only is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New_York_Central and other railroads serving the area . The New_York_Central notes : `` The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. +_O._-_B. +_O. provides the backbone of Central 's revenues .</context>

      <context> Religion at its best is out in_front , ever beckoning and leading_on , and , as Lippman put it , `` mobilizing all man 's scattered energies in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance '' . At_the_same_time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment , it also has great therapeutic value for him . It gives him aid , comfort , even solace , in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate . He is confronted with the recurrent <head>crises</head> , such_as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life - marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old_age , the certainty of death . He has_to cope_with frustration and other emotional_disturbance and anomie . His religious_beliefs provide him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern , and his religious faith makes possible fortitude , equanimity , and consolation , enabling him to endure colossal misfortune , fear , frustration , uncertainty , suffering , evil , and danger . Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state .</context>

      <context> During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration_of_Independence . During the Brown trial , however , the state 's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence_Daily_Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not_only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal_governments . The Providence_Daily_Journal answered the Daily_Post by stating that the raid of John_Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican_Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' . The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the <head>crisis</head> , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history . While the Daily_Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily_Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket_Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men . Editor_Foss stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no_doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' . The Providence_Daily_Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings .</context>

      <context> It was an old and dirty wooden structure , sadly in need of repair . But it was a landmark . It had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town , black and white , knew of it . It had just suffered a calamity , the final <head>crisis</head> in a long series of calamities . For the old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead , and the city mourned him . He was a loud-voiced man , once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability . He was stern and overbearing with his flock , but obsequious and conciliatory with the whites , especially the rich who partly supported the church .</context>

      <context> The Albany_Civic_Opera 's presentation of Spumoni 's immortal Il_Sevigli_del_Spegititgninino , with guest contralto Hattie_Sforzt . An unusual , if not extraordinary , rendering of the classic myth that involves the rescue of Prometheus from the rock by the U.S._Cavalry was given last week in the warehouse of the Albany_Leather_Conduit_Company amid cheers of `` Hubba hubba '' and `` Yalagaloo pip pip '' ! After a `` busy '' overture , the curtain rises on a farm scene - the Ranavan_Valley in northern Maine . A dead armadillo , the sole occupant of the stage , symbolizes the <head>crisis</head> and destruction of the Old_Order . Old_Order , acted and atonally sung by Grunnfeu_Arapacis , the lovely Serbantian import , then entered and delivered the well-known invocation to the god Phineoppus , whereupon the stage is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering Gorshek priests , symbolizing Love , Lust , Prudence and General_Motors , respectively . According to the myth , Old_Order then vanishes at stage_left and reappears at extreme stage_right , but director Shuz skillfully sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage_effects by simply having Miss_Arapacis walk across the stage . The night we saw it , a rather unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the armadillo , complaining - in ad-lib - that `` it smelled '' .</context>
