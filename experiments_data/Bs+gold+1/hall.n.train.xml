      <context> This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not_only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue . A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained . The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental_to playing . Yet you feel the orchestra is near at_hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect <head>hall</head> . Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation . The music is always allowed the living_space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi performer . The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .</context>

That would have made things so much easier . But he was not mad .</context>

      <context> He felt himself now , as he himself says in his Confessions , at a crucial point of his life . And that was why , on the day of the performance , when a carriage from the royal stables called to take him to the palace , he did not bother to shave . On_the_contrary , he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days . Seeing him in that condition , and about to enter the <head>hall</head> where the King , the Queen , the whole royal_family and all the members of the highest aristocracy would be present , Grimm and the Abbe_Raynal and_others tried to stop him . `` You can n't go_in that way '' ! they cried . `` Why not '' ?

      <context> They found the teakettle and put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox . Several sections of a loaf of dark_bread ; butter ; jam ; a tiny cake of ice .

While she was settling the teacart , he went_back across the <head>hall</head> to their bedroom , opened one of the suitcases , and took_out powdered coffee and sugar . She appeared with the teacart and he opened the windows . `` Do you want to call Eugene '' ?

Instead , they went_on down the <head>hall</head> to their room . `` Do you think he could be having an affair '' ? Barbara asked , as they heard the front_door close . `` Oh_no '' , Harold said , shocked .</context>

      <context> They had Vermouth , sitting in_front_of a cafe . When they got home Harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment , and thought how , under different circumstances , they might have stayed_on here , in these old-fashioned , high-ceilinged rooms that reminded him of the Irelands ' apartment in the East_Eighties . They could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days . He went down the <head>hall</head> to Eugene 's bathroom , to turn_on the hot-water_heater , and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming_trunks . He felt them . They were damp . He reached_out and felt the bath_towel hanging_on the towel_rack over the tub .</context>

      <context> `` Sabine called a_few minutes ago '' , Eugene said . `` She wants you and Barbara to have dinner with her tomorrow night '' . He handed Harold a key to the front_door , and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment . When enough time had elapsed so_that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had forgotten , Harold went_out into the <head>hall</head> and stood looking into one room after another . In the room next to theirs was a huge cradle , of mahogany , ornately carved and decorated with gold_leaf . It was the most important-looking cradle he had ever seen . Then came their bathroom , and then a bedroom that , judging by the photographs on the walls , must belong_to Mme_Cestre .</context>

A guest was locking his room ; they passed behind him and got to Alex 's room unnoticed . The doctor sat_down rather wearily , caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry loving man , but no_sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once_more .

A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille_de_chambre 's presence inside ; they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact . The doctor shot_down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory was occupied . Although a look of alarm passed_over his face , he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower_room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine .</context>
