      <context> Ordinary Carey_Williams , armed with a pistol , stood_by at the polls to insure order . `` This was the coolest , calmest election I ever saw '' , Colquitt_Policeman_Tom_Williams said . `` Being at the polls was just like being at church . I did n't smell a drop of liquor , and we did n't have a_bit of <head>trouble</head> '' . The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however . It was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone_calls and veiled threats of violence . The former county school_superintendent , George_P._Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school_board .</context>

      <context> `` A real ' nothing ' torso '' , says Henri . `` It never seemed to widen , it just got longer and longer '' . That 's when he went_to Professor_Claude . And at_once Claude saw what the <head>trouble</head> was and he knew just how to correct it . In his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked_out '' equipment since Vic_Tanny . Mr._Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now famous Weider_Push-Pull_Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . So right_away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull_Super-Set consisting_of the wide grip Straight-Arm_Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull_Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib_cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar Bench_Press which specifically works_on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids .</context>

      <context> You cannot get_along without an adequate supply of pure water . If you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well , find_out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled . A pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden . Pond water can be filtered for human use , but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so_much <head>trouble</head> . The following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses . Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ? If you can n't tell , get help from your county agricultural_agent or other local specialist .</context>

      <context> This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used . This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power . I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be . And I suggest further that the main cause of the <head>trouble</head> we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free_world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . In the recent political_campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus . One was demonstrably false ; the other , for_the_most_part , true . The first was that America had become - or was in_danger_of becoming - a second-rate military power .</context>

      <context> I murmured something about a possible difference between New_Mexico 's history and Mississippi 's . One can meet_with aloofness almost anywhere : the Thank-Heaven-We 're_-_not-Involved viewpoint , It Does n't Affect Us ! Southern Liberals ( there are a_good_many ) - especially if they 're rich - often exhibit blithe insouciance . The <head>trouble</head> here is that it 's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it does n't cost you anything . You 've already sent your daughter to Miss_X 's select academy for girls and your son to Mr._Y 's select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity . If there 's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there 's always New_England . New_England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as_well_as West .</context>

      <context> A binomial experiment can produce random_variables other_than the number of successes . For_example , the marksman gets 5 shots , but we take his score to be the number of shots before his first bull's-eye , that_is , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( or 5 , if he gets no bull's-eye ) . Thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes , and the random_variable is not the number of successes . The constancy of p and the independence are the conditions most likely to give <head>trouble</head> in_practice . Obviously , very slight changes in p do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference . ( For_instance , see Example 2 of Section 5 - 5 , on red cards in hands of 5 . ) On_the_other_hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical_phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a baseline for comparative purposes ; that_is , we may discuss the phenomenon in_terms_of its departures from the binomial model .</context>

      <context> But the parallel is significant . When the answer to what 's wrong now ? is Bill 's broken a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair . From the point_of_view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement is the predicator has broken , and from the point_of_view of meaning it would seem that the <head>trouble</head> centers in the breaking ; but dominant stress will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence . In I know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; in one thing I know it will usually be on the predicator know . In small-town people are very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly ; in the double sentence the smaller the town , the friendlier the people it will generally be on the subjects the town and the people .

      <context> The plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric_light plant . The Manchester_Depot_Sewer_Company issued 214 shares of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for its maintenance . It has given considerable <head>trouble</head> at_times and empties right into the Battenkill . Fire_District_No._1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment . The sewer on Bonnet_Street was constructed when there were only a_few houses on the street . as new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School_Street are served by it .</context>

      <context> That settled it , and we broke into parties of two and three . Cousin_Joshua_Dover decided to remain with the Reverend and poor Isaac_Pitt until life passed_away - and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world . I went_off with Cousin_Simmons , who maintained that if he did n't see to me , he did n't know who would . `` Good_heavens , Adam '' , he said , `` I thought one thing you 'd have no <head>trouble</head> learning is when to get_out of a place '' . `` I learned that now '' , I said . We ran east for about half a mile before we turned_back to the road , panting from the effort and soaked with sweat .

This , you will remember , was still New_Year's_Day .
