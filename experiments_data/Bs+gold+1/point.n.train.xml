      <context> `` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right_away '' , said Stram , quipping , `` I think I 'll put that play in the book '' . The early Southwest_Conference football leaders - Texas , Arkansas and Texas_A+M - made a big dent in the statistics last week . Texas ' 545 - yard spree against Washington_State gave the Longhorns a 3 - game total offense of 1512 yards ( 1065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high . Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A+M , with a 38 - <head>point</head> bulge against Texas_Tech ran_up its biggest total loop play since 1950 . Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards . Texas leads in per game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor 's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas ' 189 ) . A+M has the best defense against passes , 34.7 yards per game .</context>

      <context> The record_books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace . In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as_many_as 25 home_runs and stole as_many_as 25 bases .

The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick_Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park . It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . THE DENVER-AREA TV_audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home_runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob_Howsam that the games are not to be blacked_out when his Bears are playing at_home .</context>

There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion . So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein , but not great Brahms . The concert opened with another big romantic score , Schumann's Overture_to_Manfred , which suffered fate , this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic <head>point</head> to keep it afloat . Hindemith 's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands translucent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit . It got the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style . The Bayreuth_Festival opens July 23 with a new production of `` Tannhaeuser '' staged by Wieland_Wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by Wolfgang_Sawallisch .</context>

But as you can also see , it 's not a painful exercise at_all , because Henri_de_Courcy - the `` happy '' bodybuilder - looks as though he were having the time of his life ! The last exercise of Roland_Claude 's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a_bit longer pause between sets . By this time Henri 's entire chest back - lat shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting <head>point</head> , and Claude takes time to do a_bit more pectoral front deltoid shaping work . He has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline_Bench_Press ( note the high incline ) . This gives a wide flare to the pecs , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and lats .

      <context> Sometimes it takes several `` eatings '' of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world . Once you become an avocado fan , you will look_forward to the season each_year with eager anticipation . Today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world . The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this <head>point</head> . It is brought to packing_houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior . The fruit is then cooled to 42 ` F. , a temperature at which it lapses into a sort_of dormant state . This cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grove like temperature ( room_temperature ) is restored .</context>

      <context> Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions . When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep . If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real_life . Dr._H._V._Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University_of_Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel <head>points</head> of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification . As_a_matter_of_fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr._Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day . Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest 's information . Dr._Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream .</context>

      <context> The heat transfer to the anode in free_burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas_jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up **f . This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated in_detail by Maecker ( Ref. 1 ) . The pressure gradient producing the jet is_due to the nature of the magnetic_field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) . Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free_burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation <head>point</head> . it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free_burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode . The gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions ; however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux . An attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss .</context>

      <context> In the examples above , the occurrence of a bull's-eye , a straight haired mouse , or an ace could be called a `` success '' . In_general , any outcome we choose may be labeled `` success '' . The major question in this chapter is : What is the probability of exactly x successes in n trials ? In Chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples , usually by counting <head>points</head> in a sample space . Fortunately , a general formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind . Before deriving this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind '' .

Up to this <head>point</head> stress has been placed on roleplaying in_terms_of individuals . Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . For_example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying .

Morphophonemic rules may be thought_of as joining certain <head>points</head> in the system . The possibilities in the consonantal_system are very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually used .

      <context> Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs . The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic ' esthetics ' , which usually turns_out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried_over from European languages . Many_of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they purport to represent . Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial <head>points</head> while neglecting things of much greater significance . As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion . A._E._Sharp , in Vowel-Length_and_Syllabicity_in_Kikuyu , examines one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in_detail . His objective is merely to determine `` what distinctions of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography '' ( 59 ) .</context>

      <context> Downtown Los_Angeles is already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking_lot and garage - one of those preposterous `` if '' statistics has already come to pass .
