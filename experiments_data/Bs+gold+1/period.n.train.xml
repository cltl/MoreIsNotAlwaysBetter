      <context> Mr._Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now famous Weider_Push-Pull_Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . So right_away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull_Super-Set consisting_of the wide grip Straight-Arm_Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull_Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib_cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar Bench_Press which specifically works_on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids . As you can see , in this Push-Pull_Super_Set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises , so the complete torso remains pumped-up all_the_time ! Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 1 , the professor allows him about a five minute rest <head>period</head> before starting him on four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 2 . Super-Set No. 2 is made_up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat_benches . The `` push '' exercise of this Push-Pull_Super-Set is the Bench_Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation . You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs .</context>

      <context> Go_to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist . It is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things ; in_fact it is easier . But you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow . Many people think that pansies last only a_few weeks , then their <head>period</head> of growth and bloom is over . That is not true . If the plants are cared for and protected over the winter , the second year is more prolific than the first . Would you like to grow exhibition pansies ?</context>

      <context> A typical `` sonogram '' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in Fig. 5 . The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc. and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter . The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90 - degree arc in_front_of the eye to `` look_into '' all corners . The total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90 - degree rotation <head>period</head> . Drs._Howry and Holmes at the University_of_Colorado_Medical_School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results . By submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes_on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in Fig. 7 , as_well_as many other hitherto impossible insights . As mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig. 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center .</context>

      <context> The tsunami warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander_C._K._Green of the Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey staff . It consists_of a series of pipes and a pressure measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface . Ordinary water tides are disregarded . But when waves with a <head>period</head> of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set_in_motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric_circuit . This in_turn sets_off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress . Such equipment has been installed at Hilo , Midway , Attu and Dutch_Harbor . The moment the alarm goes_off , information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu , which is the center of the warning system .</context>
