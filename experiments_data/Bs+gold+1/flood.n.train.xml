      <context> In_fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers . There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision . A meteor could fall on San_Francisco . Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of <head>flood</head> or drought . Our understanding of the solar_system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing . Yet we no_longer feel uneasy . This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in_common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war .</context>

      <context> Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud . And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact . Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a <head>flood</head> of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man . Constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor_unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world_courts , and the veto power in world_councils are but a_few examples . Most_of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it . The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .</context>

      <context> weaken Castro . Another strategy - bolder and tougher - was also attracting notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world , destroy Castro . Blockade , in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe_Doctrine . It could halt a <head>flood</head> of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro . It could stop Cuban re export of guns and propaganda materials to South_America . It would be the most severe reprisal , short_of declared war , that the United_States could invoke against Castro . It is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , Members of Congress , officers in the Pentagon .</context>

      <context> he shouted , and was aghast at the echoes . `` Do n't you be afraid '' ! He would save her . If there was a fire or a <head>flood</head> he would save Mama first and Violet next . Drenched and shaking , he stood near the sweet-smelling stall and dared to pat her muzzle . `` Do n't you be afraid , Violet '' ! After the storm , the sky cleared blue and cool , and fragrant air swept the hills .</context>

      <context> He thought_of Simms_Purdew snoring on his bunk while Pullen_James crouched by the hearth , skirmishing an undershirt for lice , and a wet log sizzled . He thought_of Simms_Purdew , who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield , a maniacal scream on his lips , and swung a clubbed musket like a flail to beat down the swirl of Rebel bayonets about him . He thought_of Simms_Purdew rising_up , fearless in glory . He felt the sweetness of pity <head>flood</head> through him , veining his very flesh . Those men , lying in the huts , they did not know . They did not know who they were or know their own worth . In the pity for them his loneliness was gone .</context>

      <context> Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers . Then she fell_asleep again as suddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes . She stood_up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming_in or going_out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in_a_moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests . She went_into the living_room and turned_on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned_on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the <head>floods</head> on the barn , illuminating the driveway . She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself . They were both so young , after_all , so unready for any final parting . How could it have been thirty years already , she wondered ?</context>
