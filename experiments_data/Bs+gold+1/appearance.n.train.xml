      <context> Three were doubles , Brooks_Robinson getting a pair and Marv_Breeding one . Bill_Kunkel , Bob_Hartman and Ed_Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West_Palm_Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami_Stadium . The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took_over in the top of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee_Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning <head>appearance</head> , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . Whitey_Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base_on_balls .</context>

      <context> The wife , Amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` bird like brain '' . La^utner , for his part , `` belonged_to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in_order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so_far not fulfilled : `` They will be destroyed '' . The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as_well . His <head>appearance</head> as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other_than abasement and humiliation . At_the_same_time the multiple transvestitism involved - the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby - touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby 's , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life . The music which La^utner has composed for this episode is for_the_most_part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' . But it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice '' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art '' .</context>

      <context> Consider what follows from the positivist view . On that view , nothing good or bad happened in the case until I came_on the scene and made my remark . For what I express in my remark is something going_on in me at the time , and that of_course did not exist until I did come_on the scene . The pain of the rabbit was not itself bad ; nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured ; badness , in the only sense in which it is involved at_all , waited for its <head>appearance</head> till I came and looked and felt . Now that this is at_odds with our meaning may be shown as_follows . Let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come_on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered . Are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did ?</context>

      <context> Jews . Andrei 's skilled eye sized them up . They were not Poles . He guessed by their <head>appearance</head> that they were Rumanians . He walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka . Of all the places in Poland , Andrei hated Lublin the most . The Bathyrans were all gone .</context>

      <context> Rev looked up and saw her . Lolotte looked up and stiffened . George did n't look up at_all . There was no way to know , no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at Sarah 's <head>appearance</head> , believing her to be drugged and senseless - and just possibly dead . Rev said , `` Come in , Sarah . Reckon you know the news '' . And what news , Sarah thought as satirically as Maude might have said it .</context>
