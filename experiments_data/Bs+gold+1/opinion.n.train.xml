      <context> Bobby_Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil_Hodges turned_the_trick in Brooklyn 's Ebbetts_Field . Ed_Delahanty and Chuck_Klein of the Phillies , the Braves ' Joe_Adcock , Lou_Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat_Seerey of the White_Sox and Rocky_Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on_the_road . Willie 's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey_Mantle . This is an issue which boils_down to a matter of <head>opinion</head> , depending_on whether you 're an American or National fan and anti or pro Yankee . The record_books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace . In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as_many_as 25 home_runs and stole as_many_as 25 bases . Once the figure was 30 - 30 .</context>

      <context> Now , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they 're going_to pass those previous peaks . Yes , we know , they 're professionals , men paid to play , and they should n't care how they 're handled , just as_long_as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each_month . The truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment . For_that_matter , Stan_Musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put_out the same for seven managers , reserving his <head>opinions</head> , but not his effort . Mantle , it 's apparent , resented Casey_Stengel 's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility . The old_man was almost too possessive . Stengel inherited DiMaggio , Rizzuto , but he brought_up Mantle from Class C to the majors , from Joplin to New_York .</context>

      <context> For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry_through the study . However , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation . County judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and_others who have lived in the area for a long_time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences . A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring_out new ideas or verify <head>opinions</head> most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area . How much study is required ? This , of_course , depends_on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive_at a good decision . It is too easy for the inexperienced_person to make a quick judgment of a_few values of the area and base a decision on these alone .</context>

      <context> The American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course . An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior_design , for_the_most_part schools accredited by membership in the National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art , and a further `` on_the_spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations . One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions . The suggested course of the A.I.D. was based on the usual course offered and on the <head>opinion</head> of many educators as to curricular necessities . Obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated . Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses - architecture versus interior_design - let us examine the educational needs of the interior_designer . To_begin_with , what is an interior_designer ?</context>

      <context> The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior_designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference_of_opinion . The architects do not believe that the education of the interior_designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . Ordinary politeness may have militated against this <head>opinion</head> being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round_tables , workshops or panel_discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled_down crux_of_the_matter is education . It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior_designer 's training .</context>

      <context> On_the_other_hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity . He is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often - since private affairs rarely remain private - to the outside world as_well . `` A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband 's maleness '' , declares Dr._Calderone . This <head>opinion</head> is supported by one of the nation 's leading psychiatrists , Dr._Maurice_E._Linden , director of the Mental_Health_Division of the Philadelphia_Department_of_Public_Health . `` When the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower '' , Dr._Linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' . In one extreme case , cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker 's wife refused to have sexual_relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded . To win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer .</context>

      <context> The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation . The first_step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good_will and friendly communication on other_than the polemical level . Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached . `` All_too frequently '' , points_out James_O'_Gara , managing_editor of Commonweal , `` Catholics run_roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that Protestant <head>opinion</head> on birth_control has changed in recent decades '' . All_too often our language is unduly harsh . The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family_planning . Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .</context>

      <context> By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . The Court 's <head>opinion</head> dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of law '' . I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed . But in_any_event , I submit that the power to depose belongs_to Congress , not to this Court . I dissent .</context>

      <context> From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude . The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density * * f except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar_system in the presence of solar_radiation pressure . The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors . It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the <head>opinion</head> that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant . The values agree with the data from 1958_Alpha and 1959_Eta . The figures in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50 per_cent shielding by the Earth ; hence , these figures apply immediately above the Earth 's atmosphere . The unshielded flux is given in the last column ; these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary_space near the Earth .</context>

      <context> The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; as a complex it fits into the whole social_organization and functions dominantly in every part of_it . In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences_of_opinion as to the essential features of religion ; and there are different <head>opinions</head> as to the essential functions of religion . Nevertheless , for most_of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social_organization , they have important indirect consequences . If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows .</context>

      <context> After the diagnosing , he left the course , convinced that it could do him no good . We may say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment . The engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life - and refused to change it . We may say that his attitude was foolish , since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills ; or we may say that his attitude was commendable , showing his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the <head>opinions</head> of others . In_any_case , he refused to accept the implications of the analysis , that he needed to be made_over . Another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis , and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis .

      <context> Freeman , Cameron and McGhie , in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard_to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation '' . In my experience , a great many_of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience . Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene . Recently , for_example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her <head>opinion</head> , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was . Or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a simile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking . Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is , more_often_than_not , entirely unaware . His subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one .</context>
