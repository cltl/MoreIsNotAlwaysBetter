      <context> But then this theory confesses that it is completely at_a_loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain . The opening paragraph of the chapter titled The_Theory_Of_Representative_Perception , in the book Philosophies_Of_Science by Albert_G._Ramsperger says , `` passed_on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception '' . But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather_than to theorize on the <head>transmission</head> of an image which is already in required location . Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness . Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists_of minute waves of energy . We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound_waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite .</context>

      <context> Therefore , the scholar , as he looks_at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts . 1 ) Most_of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at_all . 2 ) The concept that an `` American national folklore '' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend . Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral <head>transmission</head> . It has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression . Related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence . Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter .</context>

      <context> The Commission may in its discretion enter an award with_respect_to one or more items deemed to have been clearly established in an individual claim while deferring consideration and action on other items of the same claim .

The Commission shall , as soon as possible , and in the order of the making of such awards , certify to the Secretary_of_the_Treasury and to the Secretary_of_State copies of the awards made in favor of the Government of the United_States or of nationals of the United_States under this Title . The Commission shall certify to the Secretary_of_State , upon his request , copies of the formal submissions of claims filed pursuant to subsection ( b ) of section 4 of_this Act for <head>transmission</head> to the foreign government concerned . The Commission shall complete its affairs in connection with settlement of United_States-Yugoslav claims arising under the Yugoslav_Claims_Agreement_of_1948 not later than December_31 , 1954 : Provided , That nothing in_this provision shall be construed to limit the life of the Commission , or its authority to act_on future agreements which may be effected under the provisions of_this legislation .

      <context> Since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend_on individual experience and are aroused in man , in_addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral_cortex , the <head>transmission</head> of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional_arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . A previously extinguished conditioned_reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges .</context>

      <context> The officers were John_Marsden , president ; John_C._Blackmer , vice-president ; George_Smith , treasurer ; and William_F._Orvis , secretary . Marsden was manager of the company for ten years and manager of its successor company , the Colonial_Light_and_Power_Company , for one year . At about the time the Marsden enterprise was getting under_way , the Vail_Light_and_Lumber_Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present Bennington_Co-operative_Creamery , intending to use its surplus power for generating electricity . Manchester then had two competing power_companies until 1904 , when the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company purchased the <head>transmission</head> system of the Vail_Company . This was fortunate , as the Vail plant burned in 1905 . The Colonial_Light_and_Power_Company was succeeded by the Vermont_Hydro-Electric_Corporation , which in_turn was absorbed by the Central_Vermont_Public_Service_Corporation . The latter now furnishes the area with electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at Manchester_Depot which was put into operation February 19 , 1930 and was improved in January 1942 by the installation of larger transformers .</context>
