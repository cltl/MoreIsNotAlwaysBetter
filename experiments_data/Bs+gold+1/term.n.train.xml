      <context> State_Party_Chairman_James_W._Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking_up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen._John_Tower will be the featured speaker . In the Blue_Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting_precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according_to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more <head>term</head> to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system - a system which the party opposes in its platform . Sam_Caldwell , State_Highway_Department public_relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd 's campaign .</context>

      <context> In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers_game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat . He has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future . He is a Buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not_only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung . U_Thant of_course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when Mr._Hammarskjold 's <head>term</head> would have come to an end . Whether the compromises - on both sides - that made_possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen . Mr._Khrushchev 's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ; the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U_Thant represents . In_a_sense , the showdown promised by Mr._Hammarskjold 's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; no precedents have been set as_yet ; structurally , the U.N. is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing_to_bear upon it .</context>

      <context> With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today - and it will be tougher in_the future . Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due_to the demanding combination of qualifications called_for by this type of management work . The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties . Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management_personnel for the longer <head>term</head> ? Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? Every single problem touched_on thus_far is related to good marketing planning . `` Hip-pocket '' tactics are going_to be harder to apply .</context>

      <context> `` Success '' and `` failure '' are just convenient labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk_about binomial trials in_general . These words are more expressive than labels like `` A '' and `` not - A '' . It is natural from the marksman 's viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success , but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse . The word `` binomial '' means `` of two names '' or `` of two <head>terms</head> '' , and both usages apply in our work : the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial , and the second to the terms p and * * f that represent the probabilities of `` success '' and `` failure '' . Sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial , we group these outcomes into two classes , as in the example of the die , where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes `` ace '' and `` not ace '' . We classify mice as `` straight haired '' or `` wavy haired '' , but a hairless mouse appears . We can escape_from such a difficulty by ruling_out the animal as not constituting a trial , but such a solution is not always satisfactory .</context>

      <context> It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation . If they opted_for illusion , it could only be illusion per_se - an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual objects . If , on_the_other_hand , they opted_for representation , it had to be representation per_se - representation as image pure_and_simple , without connotations ( at_least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed . It was the collage that made the <head>terms</head> of_this dilemma clear : the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for_the_first_time , mutually_exclusive alternatives . In_the_end , Picasso and Braque plumped_for the representational , and it would seem they did so deliberately . ( This provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality '' . ) But the inner , formal_logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shaping their decision .</context>

      <context> According to the myth , Old_Order then vanishes at stage_left and reappears at extreme stage_right , but director Shuz skillfully sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage_effects by simply having Miss_Arapacis walk across the stage .

It 's somewhat off_the_beaten_track , to_be_sure , but therein lies its variety and charm . For_example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate . Likewise , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely synonyms as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue-twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen '' all originated_in the same village in Bathar-on-Walli_Province and are all used to express sentiments concerning British `` imperialism '' .</context>
