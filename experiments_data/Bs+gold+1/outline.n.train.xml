      <context> Super-Set No. 2 is made_up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat_benches . The `` push '' exercise of this Push-Pull_Super-Set is the Bench_Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation . You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs . The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured <head>outline</head> to the pecs . The `` pull '' exercise in this Super-Set is the one dumbbell Bent-Arm_Pullover . ( Note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin_point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) . In the third Push-Pull_Super-Set the `` push '' exercise is the wide grip Pushup_Between_Bars , while the `` pull '' exercise is the Moon_Bench_Lateral_Raise with bent arms .</context>

      <context> Among the recipients of the Nobel_Prize for Literature more_than half are practically unknown to readers of English . Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner_von_Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago . Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present . In the following sketch we shall present a brief <head>outline</head> of his life and let him as_much_as_possible speak_for himself . Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family . On his father 's side he was of German descent , on his mother 's he came of the old Swedish nobility . The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake_Va ^ ttern in south central Sweden .</context>

      <context> He had already been studying the Bible ; he knew the fundamentals , and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector , announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that . Rector had never been able to find_out much about Hino 's past . Hino talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject . Putting the pieces of this mosaic together , Rector had the vague <head>outlines</head> of a biography . Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in Chiba , and divided his life between the land and the sea , supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing_boat . Without exception Hino 's brothers turned_to either one or both of their father 's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller . He had gone_into the Japanese navy , had been trained as an officer , had participated in one or two battles - he never went into detail regarding his military experience - and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out_of_the_blue , he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian .</context>
