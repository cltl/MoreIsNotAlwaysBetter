      <context> The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . It would authorize the Texas_Education_Agency to establish county-wide day_schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of_age to attend the day_schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas_School_for_the_Deaf here . Operating_budget for the day_schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El_Paso would be $ 451500 , which would be a savings of $ 157460 yearly after the first year 's <head>capital</head> outlay of $ 88000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate . The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day_school in Dallas_County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school . Dallas may get_to hear a debate on horse_race parimutuels soon between Reps._V._E._Red_Berry and Joe_Ratcliff . While details are still be to worked_out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home_folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry 's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected .</context>

      <context> A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens . Even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing_season . The worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily . He cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ; such a move may mean a loss of <head>capital</head> . Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of farm life . The farmer must get_up early , and , at_times , work late at night . Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain .</context>

      <context> It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably . Production may fall far below expectations . Drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops . Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner 's earnings , even into his <head>capital</head> . Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year . The high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis . Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities .</context>

      <context> Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop . Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now . Hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest . Proprietorships should get the tax_advantages now accruing to corporations , e._g. the chance to accumulate <head>capital</head> so vital for growth . Corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ) . The right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated . To perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming_to_the_fore , and is basically anti democratic .</context>

      <context> This combined experience , on a foundation of very average , I assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against . Perhaps a list of some of the `` practices '' of my company will help here . The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles . From an initial investment of $ 1200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional <head>capital</head> investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $ 10000000 ( we do n't disclose financial figures to the public ) . Its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth ; and no limitation is in_evidence . Our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a_few years time , despite substantial , well established competition .</context>

      <context> To qualify for either type of loan , an applicant must be a small business or approved small business `` pool '' and must meet certain credit requirements . A small business is defined as one which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field . In_addition , the SBA uses such criteria as number of employees and dollar_volume of the business . The credit requirements stipulate that the applicant must have the ability to operate the business successfully and have enough <head>capital</head> in the business so that , with loan assistance from the SBA , it will be able to operate on a sound financial basis . A proposed loan must be for sound purposes or sufficiently secured so_as to assure a reasonable chance of repayment . The record of past earnings and prospects for the future must indicate it has the ability to repay the loan out of current and anticipated income . The amount which may be borrowed from the SBA depends_on how much is required to carry_out the intended purpose of the loan .</context>

      <context> The Farm_Credit_Administration , an independent agency located within the Department_of_Agriculture , supervises and coordinates a cooperative credit_system for agriculture . The system is composed of three credit services , Federal_Land_Banks and National_Farm_Loan_Associations , Federal_Intermediate ( short-term ) Credit_Banks , and Banks_for_Cooperatives . This system provides long - and short-term credit to farmers and their cooperative marketing , purchasing , and business service organizations . As a source of investment <head>capital</head> , the system is beneficial to local communities and encourages the development of industries in rural_areas . The credit provdied by the first two services in the system outlined above is primarily for general agricultural purposes . The third credit service , Banks_for_Cooperatives , exists under authority of the Farm_Credit_Act_of_1933 . The Banks_for_Cooperatives were established to provide a permanent source of credit on a sound basis for farmers ' cooperatives .</context>

      <context> We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene . When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold_war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not_only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development . As a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world community . When we look_at countries like Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , and Burma , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern_men and of social overhead <head>capital</head> , and where institutions of centralized government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy . The men in power are committed in_principle to modernization , but economic and social changes are proceeding only erratically . Isolated enterprises have been launched , but they are not_yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern . The society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector , with very poor communications between the two .</context>

      <context> In the upper center of Braque 's first collage , Fruit_Dish ( in Douglas_Cooper 's collection ) , a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture_plane . The trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no_longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses , but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing_paper and establish depth on top of_it . Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper , and the only lesser immediacy of block_capitals that simulate window lettering , manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture_plane so that it does not `` jump '' . At_the_same_time , the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them , and by their placing in_relation_to the block_capitals ; and these <head>capitals</head> seem in_turn to be pushed_back by their placing , and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining . Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every_other part and plane ; and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface . And the same thing , more_or_less , can be said of the contents of Picasso 's first collage . In later collages of both masters , a variety of extraneous materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in_conjunction_with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think_of .</context>
