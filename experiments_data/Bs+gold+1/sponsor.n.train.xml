      <context> Under Formby 's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant_governor , speaker of the House , attorney_general and chief_justice of the Texas_Supreme_Court . State representatives decided Thursday against taking_a_poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State_Affairs_Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . Rep._Wesley_Roberts of Seminole , <head>sponsor</head> of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West_Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman_Bill_Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice .</context>

      <context> Dewey_Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas_Bankers_Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . `` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . `` You take out_of circulation many millions of dollars '' . Rep._Charles_E._Hughes of Sherman , <head>sponsor</head> of the bill , said a failure to enact it would `` amount to making a gift out_of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline_companies '' . His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott_Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor_B._Jones of Houston , J._B._Brady of Harlingen and Howard_Cox of Austin . Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday .</context>

      <context> Then O_'_Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds . This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more_or_less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek_by_jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928_-_29 '' . However , this inaugural feast did its <head>sponsors</head> no good whatever . O_'_Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal . On Election_Day - November 4 - he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes . The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates .</context>

      <context> What Joyce wanted me to do was go_to Thor 's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes - and handbag containing her identification . She realized I 'd have_to notify the police , but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name . Her impact in the ZING commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series , Underwater_Western_Eye , a documentary type show to be sponsored by Oatnut_Grits . But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the <head>sponsor</head> 's wife , Mrs._Oatnut_Grits . Or at_least not to Joyce . `` And I so want the part '' , she said . `` The commercials have just been for money , there has n't been any real incentive for me to do them , but in Underwater_Western_Eye I 'd have a chance to act .</context>
