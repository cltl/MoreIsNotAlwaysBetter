      <context> The architects do not believe that the education of the interior_designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round_tables , workshops or panel_discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled_down crux_of_the_matter is education . It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged <head>study</head> of structure . This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior_designer 's training . We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior_design student as not having serious bearing on the subject . The real question that follows is - how are those four years used and what is their value as training ?</context>

      <context> This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer . We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior_design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take_on the usual accompaniments of teaching - minimal income and minimal status among their confreres . Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such_as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable . In all `` degree '' courses in interior_design a number of `` academic '' or `` general <head>studies</head> '' courses are included . It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and_so_on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior_design , as are the art_teachers educated in the academic subjects . The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only_if this standard is observed . The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken_into_account .</context>

      <context> This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' . There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed_out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar . If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar . The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference * * f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence <head>studies</head> of fluids undergoing shear . Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45 ` to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear . According_to Philippoff , the recoverable shear s is given by * * f where |c is the angle_of_extinction . From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the * * f calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face .</context>

There is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as_such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields .</context>

      <context> These experiments can be considered exploratory only . However , they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper . They also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures . Such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as_well_as theoretical <head>studies</head> . The elasticity as a parameter of fluids which is not subject_to simple measurement at_present , and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials . Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such_as printing_inks , paints , adhesives , molten plastics , and bread_dough , for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed `` length '' , `` shortness '' , `` spinnability '' , etc. , which are usually judged by subjective methods at_present . The actual change * * f caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume , just_as_it_is for any gravitational or osmotic_pressure head .</context>

      <context> The saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect_Coombs_test in the following manner . The cells were washed three times with saline , anti human serum was added , the cells were resuspended , and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined for agglutination . The anti human sera used were prepared by injecting whole human serum into rabbits . Those antisera shown by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the `` broad spectrum '' type were selected for used in the present <head>study</head> . The red_cells for the Rh_antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the * * f cells , which had been glycerolized and stored at - 20 ` C for approximately 1 year . These cells were thawed at 37 ` C for 30 min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2 % ) . The cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended to 2 % in saline .</context>

      <context> As early as 1858 , Le_Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries in human_beings . In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz . The opposition to this point_of_view has its staunchest support in the work of Miller ( ' 50 ) . Apparently , however , Miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and cats , and he has been criticized for using pathologic human material in his normal <head>study</head> ( Loosli , ' 38 ) . Although Miller noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals , nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian lungs other_than in the dog and cat ( Miller , ' 13 ; ' 25 ) . The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial_artery as found in the horse is not clear . However , this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung .</context>

      <context> This involves step-by-step progress , and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry . If of the founders of glottochronology Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding , and Lees has repudiated his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should swerve . There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by Swadesh 's rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown so vast . It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic <head>studies</head> on a more humble , solid , and limited basis . I would propose , first , an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved . I would propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible . There would be no conceivable sense in going_to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable .</context>

      <context> His image of the_Virgin had always been that of a young_woman , even as had his memory of his mother . Jacopo_Galli introduced him into several Roman homes . Here he sketched , sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk , young_girls not_yet twenty , some about to be married , some married a year or two . Since the Santo_Spirito_hospital had taken only men , he had had no experience in the <head>study</head> of female anatomy ; but he had sketched the women of Tuscany in their fields and homes . He was able to discern the body lines of the Roman women under their robes . He spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together : a Mary who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; and a Jesus who , though lean , was strong even in death - a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead_room of Santo_Spirito . He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketches .</context>

      <context> Visually , these approximated what he was feeling within himself . At_the_same_time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping_at the stalls , storing up fresh impressions of what they looked_like , how they moved . In_particular he sought the gentle , sweet-faced nuns , with head_coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads , remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper . Discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a <head>study</head> of the anatomy of folds . He improvised as he went_along , completing a life-size clay figure , then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber , to the consistency of thick mud . No fold could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the Madonna 's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive support to Christ 's body , to intensify her inner turmoil . When the cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made .</context>

He was told to ask for Rabbi_Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon . Michelangelo found the rabbi in the room of <head>study</head> , a gentle old_man with a white beard and luminous grey eyes , robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head .
