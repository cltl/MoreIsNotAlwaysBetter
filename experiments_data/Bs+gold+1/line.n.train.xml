      <context> Fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them do n't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material . But there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts - one dominated_by money , the other by nineteenth century German scholarship . Both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found . Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage_system and the electric light <head>lines</head> . The commercial propagandist , who can n't afford to be critical , gets_along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst 's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine . His standards are , of_course , completely foreign to those of the analyst . To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications .</context>

      <context> Since the Supreme_Court 's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little_Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old_South . Belief in the traditional way_of_life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones . Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South_Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North_Carolina , and Alabama following along after them . Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; so_that a <head>line</head> running down the length of the South marking the upper_limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old_South from the new , but with , of_course , important minority enclaves . The long settled areas of states like Virginia and South_Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater . Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such_as the coastal lowlands centering_on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West_Indies than with the North even after independence . The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area .</context>

      <context> During the discharge the magnetic_forces set_up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center_line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera . Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60 - 80 microseconds . The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil . Besides the well-known hydrogen <head>line</head> at 21 cm wavelength , the spectra of extraterrestrial radio_sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small molecules . The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres . Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH ; somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH , SiH , and ScH . Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ; in interstellar gas , concentrations as low as * * f molecules / * * f may be sufficient , as compared to the * * f hydrogen_atoms * * f required for detection of the 21 - cm line .</context>

      <context> Mr._Speaker , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have . The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex - high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two . And the solutions to the problems of the commuter <head>lines</head> have been equally varied , ranging all_the_way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service . There have been a number of sound plans proposed . But none of these has been implemented . Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping_hand .</context>

Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General_Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend stemmed `` at_least in part '' from the needs of General_Motors outstripping du_Pont 's capacity .</context>

      <context> This claim , as submitted to the District_Court and dismissed by it , 126_F._Supp .235 , alleged violation not_only of 7 of the Clayton_Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman_Act . The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any <head>line</head> of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' .</context>

      <context> In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; and the dwindling built soap_powders as_well_as soap_flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . A well publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid_detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder / active ratio . Hard surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork . The better quality products in both of these <head>lines</head> contain phosphate builders . In_addition , many of the hard surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium_orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products . Many scouring powders now also contain phosphates . These hard surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28 .</context>

      <context> Would condemnation be fitting if , independently of the condemnation , there were nothing bad to condemn ? In such a case , any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other , which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point . Indeed we are forced to go much farther . If goodness and badness lie_in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them , those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible <head>line</head> . If there is nothing evil in these things , if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them , why should n't they be greeted with a cheer ? To greet them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something bad ; it would needlessly bring badness into the world ; and even on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright . On_the_other_hand , to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good ; it would bring goodness into the world .</context>

      <context> What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search . These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces . To interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period . The historian can only point_out those <head>lines</head> which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding . Throughout the Dark_ages , it is clear , the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently . The pace could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood_on_firm_ground . The landscape of Greek history broadens widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century B.C. , the age of Homer 's `` rosy fingered Dawn '' .</context>

      <context> Whenever artists , indeed , turned_to actual representations or molded three-dimensional_figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . At_the_least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter <head>line</head> . Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go_too_far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . The storms of the past had died_away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not_yet begun to disturb men 's minds .</context>

      <context> Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines . In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos . They had had_to work_on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses . The potters , in_particular , had virtually eschewed freehand drawing , elaborate motifs , and the curving <head>lines</head> of nature , while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe . In their vases were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization , at_first hesitantly in Protogeometric work , and_then more confidently in the initial stages of the Geometric style . By 800 social and cultural security had been achieved , at_least on a simple plane ; it was time to take bigger steps , to venture on experiments . Ripe_Geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited .</context>
