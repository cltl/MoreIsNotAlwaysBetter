      <context> Kerr , who set the world_record earlier this month in New_York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped_out Mills 's early pace and beat the young Big_10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal_Whitfield . Mills shot out in_front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race . Then Kerr , a graduate_student from Illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held_off Mills 's <head>challenge</head> on the final turn . Mills was timed in 1.10.4 . The crowd at the twenty-first annual K._of_C._Games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a_few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one week old world_record in the half-mile run . Mrs._Grace_Butcher , of nearby Chardon , a 27 - year old housewife who has two children , finished in 2.21.6 .</context>

      <context> These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post World_War_1 , era . Prokofieff 's outlook as a composer pianist conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant . Prokofieff 's Classical_Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well trained musician still in his twenties . To the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; to the Neo Classicists , it was a <head>challenge</head> to the pre-war world . What was it to Prokofieff ? A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18_th Century ideas ; a trial_balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; a brilliant piece_de_resistance ? Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon .</context>

      <context> Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing_tackle , windbreaks and sunshades . We saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70 mile long National_Seashore_Recreation_Area . Dealers would do_well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers . Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the <head>challenges</head> and possibilities facing the industry . Camping is big and getting bigger . No one knows where it will stop . Almost every official who reflects on_it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets .</context>

      <context> During the last years of Woodrow_Wilson 's administration , a red_scare developed in our country . Many Americans reacted irrationally to the <head>challenge</head> of Russia and turned_to the repression of ideas by force . Postmaster_General Burleson set_about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails . Attorney_General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more_than 4000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights . Then , not many years later , the Un-American_Activities_Committee , under the leadership of Martin_Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens .</context>

      <context> As shown earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple elements . Success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved . By the time the child first attacks the actual problem of reading , he is completely familiar and at_ease with all_of the elements of words . Apparently academic <head>challenge</head> in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so_that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or panicked . Sarason et_al. present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test like situation , and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher . Although the present study was not a direct replication of their investigations , the results do not confirm their conclusion . Observers , in the two school_systems studied here , judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and demanding , while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting .</context>
