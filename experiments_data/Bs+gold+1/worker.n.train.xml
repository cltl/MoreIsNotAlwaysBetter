      <context> West_Berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable . Nearly 18 per_cent of West_Berlin 's 2200000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12.8 per_cent are under fifteen . R._H._S._Crossman , M.P. , writing in The_Manchester_Guardian , states that departures from West_Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a week . The official statistics show that 60 per_cent are employed <head>workers</head> or independent professional people . Whole families are moving and removal_firms are booked for months ahead . The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each_week from West_Germany , but the hard truth , says Crossman , is that `` The closing_off of East_Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East_German , as distinct from Russian , troops was a major Communist victory , which dealt West_Berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow . The gallant half city is dying on_its_feet '' .</context>

Douglass has studied the crystal structure of **f by x-ray_diffraction . He finds the structure contains an **f bond with the **f distance of **f .

      <context> With detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a_few counts , the second and third Russian space_probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less_than that of larger ones . Being based on so few events , these results are of dubious validity . The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in_terms_of the particle parameters is very uncertain . Many <head>workers</head> believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities . However , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship . In the United_States , most_of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces . The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor .</context>

      <context> The Taylor_Scale was adapted from the Minnesota_Multiphastic_Personality_Inventory , with item selection based upon clinical definitions of anxiety . There is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees . Reliability and validation work with the Children 's Anxiety_Scale by Castaneda , et_al. demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale . Although the Taylor_Scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained <head>workers</head> who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items . The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . The two ratings yield a correlation of + .04 , which is not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics . In_theory , compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer .</context>

Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown .
