      <context> Without dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen._A._R._Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally_retarded in the Gulf_Coast district . Money for its construction will be sought later_on but in_the_meantime the State_Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site . Two tax revision bills were passed . One , by Sen._Louis_Crump of San_Saba , would aid more than 17000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise_taxes by eliminating the requirement that each <head>return</head> be notarized . Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $ 1000 fine . It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas_Research_League . The other bill , by Sen._A._M._Aikin_Jr. of Paris , would relieve real_estate_brokers , who pay their own annual licensing_fee , from the $ 12 annual occupation_license on brokers in such_as stocks and bonds .</context>

      <context> In the 355 years since the first Guy_Fawkes_Night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a reminder '' . The article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill King_James_/1_1 , . In_spite_of the increase in numbers and prestige brought_about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840 's and 1850 's , the Catholic segment of England one_hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per_cent , or 800000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public . The <head>return</head> of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked_upon with indignant disapprobation and , in_fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty . In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in_order_to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers . Now , in 1961 , the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per_cent , or 5 million ) ; yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population . A Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going_in and out of the Birmingham_Oratory ( Catholic ) Church on Sunday mornings .</context>

      <context> Production may fall far below expectations . Drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops . Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner 's earnings , even into his capital . <head>Returns</head> for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year . The high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis . Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities . Part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities .</context>

      <context> Consider what happened during World_War_1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress . Many_of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful . With over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . With the <head>return</head> of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens . The attempt to enforce that belief ushered_in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history . The so-called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end . That tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society .</context>

      <context> And yet amid all the gay hedonism in Pilgrimage and Wander-Years is a cycle of short poems , '' Thoughts_in_Loneliness `` , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing '' . Of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as `` Nameless_and_Immortal '' , which at_once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language . It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum , next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence . On the eve of his <head>return</head> to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection . The supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality . Not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal . `` The man 's true reputation is his work '' .</context>

      <context> I suppose we might classify Billy_Graham as an old liberal . And I would further note that they all - with one exception again - sang in one key or another the same song . Its refrain was : `` Let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation '' . Adlai_Stevenson expressed some reservations about this <head>return</head> . Others invoked technology and common_sense . Only Walter_Lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most_of what we used_to regard_as the program of our national purposes '' . But the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent .</context>

      <context> The appeal_board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation . In his answer thereto , he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 , and asserted that his only claim to `` pioneering '' was in 1952 . The appeal_board , however , unanimously concurred in the Department 's recommendation . Upon <head>return</head> of the file to the local board , petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so . Petitioner first contends that the Department denied him procedural due_process by not giving him timely opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal_board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching . But the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file . He admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times , and he could have rebutted it before the hearing_officer .</context>

      <context> Rector was often curious ; often tempted to ask questions but he never did . If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so unasked . Rector had no doubt that Hino would come_back from the village bursting with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellished with his active imagnation . When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village , Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his <head>return</head> , for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector 's office rarely rang unless it was important . He was surprised to find Kayabashi 's secretary on the other end of the line . He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted . The oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries , the secretary said , businessmen from Tokyo for_the_most_part , and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission .</context>

Pausing in the doorway he said : `` The form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , is the most challenging loveliness in all nature '' .

By odd coincidence , on the evening of her <head>return</head> Shelley chose to read Parisina , which was the latest of the titled poet 's successes . As he declaimed the sonorous measures , it was as_much_as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting_out with her dramatic tidings . `` Although it is not the best of which he is capable '' , said Shelley as he closed the book , `` it is still poetry of a high order '' . `` If he would only leave the East '' , said Mary .</context>

Below these particulars was a series of alpha beta gammas connected by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed . Alex 's instruction was rapid , for the doctor had_to go_off to the Rue_Ecole_de_Medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all . But after the doctor 's <head>return</head> that night Alex could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels , apparently giving its egg hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen . A knocking at Alex 's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning . It was the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in_haste . The doctor stood about , waiting for Alex to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the still dark hallways , past the bedroom of the patronne , and so into the street .</context>

While they were away Blanche came into the office every morning , running things as she had always run them for Stanley , going_through the week in a dazed stupor , getting things done automatically , out of habit . For exactly one week , she was able to continue in this manner . On the morning of Stanley 's <head>return</head> , however , her strength left her . Two hours of watching his serenely happy face , listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled figures , and Blanche had_to leave . She stayed away for ten days .

      <context> After a_few tortuous moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that Neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in_the_eyes_of a mute piece of sculpture . The effect , needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at_times a_bit obscure , the film is certainly a much needed catharsis for the `` repressed '' movie-goer . THE MUSIC OF BINI_SALFININISTAS , CAPITAL_LP 63711 - R , one of the rare recordings of this titanic , yet unsung , composer . Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov_Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his <head>return</head> to public notice ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach lay_dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas passed_through his `` purgatory '' of neglect . But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc_Schlek_, Jr. , a major revival is under_way . As he leads the Neurenschatz_Skolkau_Orchestra , Schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor 's insistence . A major portion of the credit should also go to flautist Haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` Indianapolis '' movement in the Baslot .</context>
