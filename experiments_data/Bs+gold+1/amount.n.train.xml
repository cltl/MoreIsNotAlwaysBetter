      <context> This can be done by stories in your house_organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers ' homes as_well_as by_word_of_mouth through your chain of command . Some companies find a little imagination helpful . Hallmark_Cards_,_Inc. , Kansas_City , Mo. , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` Benefit_Bafflers '' , which it distributes to employees . M_+_R_Dietetic_Laboratories_,_Inc. , Columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook - each check showing the <head>amount</head> the company spends on a particular fringe . U._S._Rubber_Company , New_York , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits . The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for_example , costs $ 227.72 . Have the insurance_company or your own accounting department break_down the cost of your insurance package periodically .</context>

      <context> The check had been mailed from Chicago , the envelope bore no return_address , and the check was not signed . `` That 's Johnny '' , sighed the bank president , `` the best hearted boy in the world , but absent-minded '' . But Mercer 's explanation was simple : `` I made_out the check and carried it around a_few days unsigned - in_case I lost it '' . When he remembered that he might have not signed the check , Mercer made_out another for the same <head>amount</head> , instructing the bank to destroy the other - especially if he had happened_to have absent-mindedly signed both of them . When the family business failed , Mercer left school and on his mother 's urging - for she hoped that he would become an actor - he joined a local little theater group . When the troupe traveled_to New_York to participate in a one act play competition - and won - Mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in New_York . He had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah .</context>

In_order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational_rehabilitation services , Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on ( 1 ) need , as measured by a State 's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measured by its per_capita income . The Act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State . It stipulates , in_addition , that all <head>amounts</head> remaining as_a_result_of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums . These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per_capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State . The provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in State programs already in_operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone .

      <context> In 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at $ 18.9 billion , compared to $ 19.3 billion in 1960 . The decreases , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such_as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic_devices . Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 .

      <context> This , however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs . The face of one block contained a hole 1 16 '' in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure . Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types . Two of the fluids showed a high positive normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in_comparison_with the <head>amount</head> of the positive pressures generated by the other two . Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure .

A system had_to be used which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time .</context>

      <context> The market today for detergent_builders is quite diverse . The best_known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up_to 50 % by weight of sodium_tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium_tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium_pyrophosphate .

A well publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid_detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder / active ratio .
