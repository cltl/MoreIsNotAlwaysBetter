      <context> He had a 16 . Palmer 's dozen were honestly earned . Nor were there any rules to save him . If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the <head>code</head> as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book . This knowledge has come_in_handy , too . His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway . The ball floated downstream .</context>

      <context> It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel_de_Cervantes ' `` Don_Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide_screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth_Street and Sixty-eighth_Street_Playhouses . More_than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho_Panza , in seventeenth century Spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . Nikolai_Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander_Nevsky and Ivan_the_Terrible , performs the lanky Don_Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . His addle-brained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous <head>code</head> of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no_doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues . Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do . He treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect . Directed by Grigory_Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world .</context>

      <context> That society responds by condemning the private_eye as a threat to the status_quo , a potential criminal . If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society . He must , in_short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel . On_the_other_hand , if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession , he must abandon his own <head>code</head> and sacrifice his precious individualism . Dashiell_Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery_stories and turning_to other pursuits . His successors have adopted the opposite alternative . In_order to save the mystery_story , they have converted the private_detective into an organization man .</context>

      <context> He is , first_and_foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society . It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts_for the great appeal of the mythological detective . By_virtue_of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private_eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle_class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let_the_devil_take_the_hindmost . At_the_same_time , because the personal <head>code</head> of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle_class eyes a virtuous man . In this way , the private_detective gets the best of two possible worlds . He is an individualist but not an anarchist ; he is a public servant but not a cop . In_short , the fictional private_eye is a specialized version of Adam_Smith 's ideal entrepreneur , the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare .</context>

      <context> One would need_to test this proposition carefully ; after_all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) Reader 's Digest literature on the `` most unforgettable character I ever met '' deals with village grocers , country_doctors , favorite if illiterate aunts , and_so_forth . Scientists often turn_out to be idiosyncratic , too . But still , the proposition is worth examination . It is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some <head>code</head> of `` right '' and `` wrong '' . I do not know that this is true ; both Flugel and Ranyard_West deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologians as Niebuhr and Buber . It forms the core of many , perhaps most , problems of psychotherapy . I am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary_study in the development of conscience - most_of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life , or , for the theologians of_course , to the influence of religion .</context>

I am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary_study in the development of conscience - most_of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life , or , for the theologians of_course , to the influence of religion . Still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one 's ideas of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic_books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of_this influence . Probably the most important thing to focus_on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the <head>code</head> which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available . This is in large part a code_of_behavior and a glossary of values : what is it that people do and should do and_how one should regard it . In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint . Literature may be said to give people a sense_of_purpose , dedication , mission , significance .</context>

      <context> Stained or unstained sections were examined under dark_field_illumination in a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp ( Osram_HBO 200 ) . The light_beam from the lamp was filtered through a half standard thickness Corning 1840 filter . In the eyepiece a Wratten 2 B filter was used to filter off residual ultra-violet_light . A red filter , Zeiss barrier filter with the <head>code</head> ( Schott ) designation BG 23 , was also used in the ocular lens assembly as it improved the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence . In the first few experiments * * f was passed_through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet_clover tissue powder . The intermediate sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder . Sections of sweet_clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1 : 10 solution of * * f for 30_minutes , washed in buffered saline for 15_minutes , stained with * * f for 30_minutes , and washed for 15_minutes in PBS .</context>

      <context> The credo unifies and socializes men by attaching them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the firmer the group . The religious symbolism , and especially the closely related rites and worship forms , constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith . The religion , in_fact , is an expression of the unity of the group , small or large . The common <head>codes</head> , for religious action as_such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotees together . These are ways of jointly participating in significantly symbolized , standardized , and ordered religiously sanctified behavior . The codes are mechanism for training in , and directing and enforcing , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group .

His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit . This is brought_out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United_States ; and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds .</context>
