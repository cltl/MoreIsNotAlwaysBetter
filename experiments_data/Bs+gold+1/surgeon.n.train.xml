      <context> The peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across_the_nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy . In New_York_City in 1958 , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive_device . He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman_Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy . A year later in Albany , N._Y. , a Roman_Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic <head>surgeon</head> because of his connection with the Planned_Parenthood_Association . Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious_belief and conscience . These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue . It has flared_up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family welfare agencies .</context>

      <context> On May 11 , she reached Iceland . Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` Lousie_Bay '' . The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome .

The issue was settled on_shore , Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore , determined to catch the next fishing_boat back to England . With difficulty , Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship , and they sailed from Iceland . Early in June , the Discovery passed `` Desolation '' ( southern Greenland ) and in mid-June entered the `` Furious_Overfall '' .</context>

      <context> No group of officers came_in_for more spirited denunciation than the doctors . One Federal_soldier wrote : `` The docters is no_a_conte . hell will be filde with do_[_c_]_ters and offersey when this war is over '' . Shortly after the beginning of Sherman 's Georgia campaign , an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk : `` The <head>surgeon</head> insisted on Sending me to the hospital for treatment . I insisted on takeing_the_field and prevailed - thinking that I had_better die by rebel bullets than [ by ] Union quackery '' . The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward each other were very_much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred . The Rebs were , to a Massachusetts corporal , `` fighting madmen or not men at_all but whiskey + gunpowder put into a human frame '' .</context>

      <context> Argiento never left his side , keeping the water boiled , applying hot compresses throughout the night . By the second day Michelangelo began to worry ; and by the second night he was in a state of panic : he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye . At dawn Argiento went_to Jacopo_Galli . Galli arrived with his family <head>surgeon</head> , Maestro_Lippi . The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons . He told Argiento to take a bird out of the cage , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood gush into Michelangelo 's injured eye . The surgeon came_back at dusk , cut the vein of a second pigeon , again washed out the eye .</context>

      <context> He found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap , and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt , its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost . He hoped he was free_of self-deception . Here he was , suddenly caught_up in the delirium of a war , in the spite and calumny of Whigs and Tories . There would be great need soon for his skill as <head>surgeon</head> , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war . David_Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface . He knew that many were using it for their own ends . But it did not matter .</context>

      <context> But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or mess-hall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond . These letters became the center of my existence . I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer . My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when '' ; and_others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commencing again her piano_lessons , her private_school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a <head>surgeon</head> returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe . In my letters I took_on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real_life . Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after_school class I was enrolled . The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young_man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot_Sands - he of the porch steps anecdotes - who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked_off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them .</context>

Like Eliot , in my fantasies , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night 's climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love . The night after reading her letter about her <head>surgeon</head> uncle - it must have been late in September - I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and bloody , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life . For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in_that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie_awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep . The weeks went_by , and the longer our separation grew , the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became . They caused my love for Jessica to become warmer and at_the_same_time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again .</context>
