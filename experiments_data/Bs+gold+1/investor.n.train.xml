      <context> Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned_out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many_another intelligent , well-informed American . But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $ 2000000 profit on the stock_market . Every man who dabbles_in the market to make a_little easy_money on_the_side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb . <head>Investors</head> breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best_seller book to make some dough . People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's-eye achievements . The promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it . His answer was simple but honest .</context>

      <context> The Central has pointed_out . `` The logic of creating a strong , balanced , competitive two system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B._+_O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here . Detailed studies of the plan were well underway . Though far from completion , these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned , their <head>investors</head> , their customers , their users , and to the public at_large . Then , abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , B. + O. entered on-again-off-again negotiations with C. + O. which resulted in the present situation . In the light of the facts at_hand , however , New_York_Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two system eastern railroad structure in the public interest `` . The Interstate_Commerce_Commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed C._+_O._-_B. + O. merger on June 18 .</context>

      <context> Du_Pont would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General_Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of du_Pont could serve as a director of General_Motors without court approval . Du_Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General_Motors stock except through General_Motors ' distributions of stock or subscription_rights to its stockholders . On June 6 , 1958 , General_Motors submitted its objections to the Government 's proposal . It argued , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both General_Motors and du_Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent <head>investors</head> , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; that the tremendous volume of General_Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General_Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity . General_Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as_required by the mandate of_this Court . The decrees proposed by the amici_curiae were filed in August of 1958 . These plans , like du_Pont 's contained provisions for passing the vote on du_Pont 's General_Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their spouses , and other people living in their households , as_well_as other specified persons , were to be totally disenfranchised .</context>
