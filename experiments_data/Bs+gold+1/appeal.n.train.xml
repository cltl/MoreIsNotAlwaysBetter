      <context> To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications . Dominated_by the vicious_circle of the university promotion_system , the analyst looks_down_on and gets_along poorly with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector . The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a_few energetic amateurs and collectors . The work done by the analysts , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no_more <head>appeal</head> than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience . Publishers want books that will sell , recording_studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used_to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high_schools want quaint , but moral , material . The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit_in . As a result , most people do n't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is ; they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legends and patriotic anecdotes , with a superstition or remedy thrown_in here_and_there .</context>

      <context> However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including du_Pont 's competitors '' , 353_U._S._,_at_607 , outweighed the Government 's claim for relief . This claim , as submitted to the District_Court and dismissed by it , 126_F._Supp .235 , alleged violation not_only of 7 of the Clayton_Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman_Act . The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's <head>appeal</head> from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation .</context>

      <context> We found in Gonzales_v._United_States , supra , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant . We said there that it was necessary `` that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut [ the Department 's ] recommendation when it comes to the Appeal_Board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification '' . 348_U._S._,_at_412 . We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner 's contention , which was considered by the <head>appeal</head> board and denied by it . As was said in Gonzales , `` it is the Appeal_Board which renders the selective_service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact . Estep_v._United_States , 327_U._S._114_'' . 348_U._S._,_at_412_-_413 .</context>

      <context> While the regulations formerly required that the hearing_officer 's report be placed in the registrant 's file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952 . Moreover , the hearing_officer 's report is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney_General and , of_course , is not the recommendation of the Department . It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department_of_Justice , of which the Attorney_General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection . It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes_into the making of the final recommendation to the <head>appeal</head> board . It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing_officer 's notes were furnished to the appeal board . Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board . Petitioner knew that the Department 's recommendation was based not on the hearing_officer 's report but on the statement of the local board in his file .</context>

It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing_officer 's report and notes at the trial . In_addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes . While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process .</context>

Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing_officer as_well as at the trial . He did receive a resume of it - the same that was furnished the appeal board - and he made no claim of its inaccuracy . Even now no such claim is asserted .</context>

A sleepy voice answered . `` Le petit_dejeuner '' , Harold said , in an accent that did credit to Miss_Sloan , his high-school French_teacher . At_the_same_time , his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here , and conveyed an <head>appeal</head> to whatever is reasonable , peace-loving , and dependable in everybody . Since ordinary breakfast-table conversation was impossible , it was at_least something that they were able to offer Eugene the sugar_bowl with their sugar in it , and the plate of bread_and_butter , and that Eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first . Eugene put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water . Stirring , he said : `` I am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with you today '' .</context>
