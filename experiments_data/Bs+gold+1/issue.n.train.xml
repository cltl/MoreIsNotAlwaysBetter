      <context> The Georgia_Legislature will wind_up its 1961 session Monday and head for home - where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly . Before adjournment Monday afternoon , the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban_areas to determine what adjustments should be made . Gov._Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment . Vandiver likely will mention the $ 100 million highway bond <head>issue</head> approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . Meanwhile , it was learned the State_Highway_Department is very near being ready to issue the first $ 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test_suit to test the validity of the act , and_then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway_Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural_Roads_Authority bonds for rural road construction work .</context>

The department apparently intends to make the Rural_Roads_Authority a revolving_fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid_off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov._Marvin_Griffin .</context>

      <context> And they could n't have entrusted Henri to better hands because `` le_professeur '' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido_mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis_anticus of the leg - and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth . That 's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal_Health_Studio which is located at 1821 Mt._Royal_East in Montreal . Undoubtedly you have read the case_histories of some of his prize_winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) . There 's Gaetan_d'Amours who is our newest Mr._Canada ; Jean-Paul_Senesac , whose story appeared here two <head>issues</head> ago ; Jack_Boissoneault , who was with us last month ; Charles_Harve , who recently won the `` Most Muscular Man '' subdivision award in the Mr._Canada event ; and a host of others . Yesiree , the professor knows his muscles ! Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4 ' 10 '' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack_on some weight . About that time he began reading Mr._America and Muscle_Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight_gaining .</context>

      <context> These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case . It might be contended , of_course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism . But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben_Gurion and set_forth in the indictment . In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have_to be tied to the <head>issue</head> by argument . One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages . Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell_into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism . Yes , he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of_course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; but he believed in the Jew as enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things .</context>

      <context> And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons . The name presumably derives from the French royal_house which never learned and never forgot ; since Bourbon whiskey , though of Kentucky origin , is at_least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South . The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North . The race_problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , <head>issues</head> which may fundamentally be even more divisive . It is these other differences between North and South - other , that_is , than those which concern discrimination or social_welfare - which I chiefly discuss herein . I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience . A Southerner married to a New_Englander , I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity_men , and business_executives of egghead tastes .</context>

      <context> In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old_South . Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no_longer any hope of sharing_in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother_country . And no_doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . Among Bourbons the racial <head>issue</head> may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors . All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did . Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties . But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South - to use the moderate words favored by Mr._Thomas_Griffith - finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North .</context>

      <context> In every war of the United_States since the Civil_War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country . So instead of being tests of the South 's loyalty , the Spanish_War , the two World_Wars , and the Korean_War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion . And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold_war against Communism . Had the situation been reversed , had , for_instance , England been the enemy in 1898 because of <head>issues</head> of concern chiefly to New_England , there is little doubt that large_numbers of Southerners would have happily put_on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain . It is extraordinary that a_people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have . The North should thank_its_stars that such has been the case ; but at_the_same_time it should not draw false inferences therefrom . The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .</context>

      <context> So an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation . In_any_event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the `` disease '' , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical . Have not our physical_abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ? Hence the prime <head>issue</head> , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature . We are already committed to establishing man 's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social political economical context we are fond of today . Otherwise , we go_on endlessly trying to draw_the_line , color and other , as to which kind_of man we wish to see dominate . We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else .</context>

      <context> Efforts such_as the Community_Development_Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development . To achieve this goal of balanced development , communications between the central government and the local communities must be such_that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken_into_account . If modernization programs are imposed from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulties . Land_reform is likely to be a pressing <head>issue</head> in many of these countries . It should be American policy not_only to encourage effective land_reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society . As an isolated policy , land_reform is likely to be politically disruptive ; as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance . It should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone .</context>

      <context> The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . The two ratings yield a correlation of + .04 , which is not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics . In_theory , compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer . The <head>issue</head> of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken_up later . In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress , and the children 's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years . In establishing criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself . The predicted interaction effect should , if potent , extend its influence over all academic achievement .</context>

      <context> King_Muhammad /5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections on May_Day , 1957 . There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister_of_the_Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less_than enthusiastic . Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the_French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious . From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental <head>issues</head> in Moroccan politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government . Until the Charter_of_Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes . The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 , but the P.D.I. ( Parti_Democratique_de_l'Independance ) , the most important minor party at the time , objected to the Istiqlal 's predominance in the civil_service and influence in Radio_Maroc . There were rumors that the Ministry_of_the_Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings .</context>

      <context> Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied . In late 1957 the M.P. ( Mouvement_Populaire ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council_of_Government under Balafrej was formed without support from progressive elements in the party . The parties were on_the_whole unprepared for elections , while the people were still experiencing post independence let-down and suffering the after_effects of poor harvests in 1957 . Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central <head>issue</head> . They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held . But the eagerly sought `` homogeneity '' of the Balafrej Council_of_Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled over foreign_policy , labor politics and economic development . By December , 1958 , when ' Abdallah_Ibrahim became President_of_the_Council , elections had even greater importance .</context>

      <context> The epic_poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the rise of firm political_units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men - all these had to await the progress of following decades . What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search . These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces . To interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side <head>issues</head> and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period . The historian can only point_out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding . Throughout the Dark_ages , it is clear , the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently . The pace could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood_on_firm_ground .</context>

      <context> The layout of the sewer_lines was designed by Henry_W._Taylor , who was the engineer for the Manchester_Village disposal_plant . No figures were submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town . The 1958 town_meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facilities . The final step was a vote for a $ 230000 bond <head>issue</head> for the construction of a sewage_system by the 1959 town_meeting , later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special town_meeting June_21 , 1960 . There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams . Manchester 's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev._J._D._Wickham , headmaster of Burr and Burton_Seminary , was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , Samuel_F._B._Morse . At_any_rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington .</context>
