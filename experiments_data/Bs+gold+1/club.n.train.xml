Through the efforts of SAAMI 's shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a_few . The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many_of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it .</context>
