      <context> An attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as_such '' . His plan and intent were clearly charted . Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions . In one <head>debate</head> he supported the freedom of judgment as_opposed_to dogma , in another he held that the practice of science was in_fact an act of religious worship . He continued as a popular lecturer . He devised a detonating_fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric_current . In 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm , one of the Danish islands , being one of three scientists in the expedition .</context>

      <context> But is that not like going_to a chemistry_laboratory and blindly pouring_out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder_drug inevitably to result ? What of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? Is there some magic in it that assures results ? When Peter_B._Kyne ( Pride_of_Palomar , 43 ) informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike for the Japanese , did the heated <head>debates</head> of the Californians settle the truth or falsity of the proposition ? The Leopard 's_Spots came from the pen of Thomas_Dixon in 1902 , and in_this he announced an `` unchangeable '' law . If a child had a single drop of Negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3000 years . That doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ?</context>

      <context> The son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger_nails . In_time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child . Is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ? Will argument and <head>debate</head> decide its truth or falsity ? For answers to such questions we must turn_to the anthropologists , the biologists , the historians , the psychologists , and the sociologists . Long_ago they consigned the notions of Kyne and Dixon to the scrap_heap . False ideas surfeit another sector of our life .</context>

      <context> For several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship . The stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress . Children , conditioned by this mistaken notion , have feared stepmothers , while adults , by their antagonistic attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one . <head>Debate</head> is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild a happier one . Research , on_the_other_hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers . Helen_Deutsch informed us ( The_Psychology_of_Women , Vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many . Will mere debate on that proposition , even_though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ?</context>

      <context> But ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough . In the 1930 's , cures for the depression literally flooded Washington . For a time the President received hundreds of them every_day , most_of them worthless . Ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and <head>debate</head> . When some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for_instance , we do not turn_to free and open discussion as in a political_campaign . We have recourse to the scientifically trained specialist in the laboratory . The merits of the Salk anti polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children .</context>

In_truth , we can say that this broke the power of Senator_Joseph_McCarthy , who was finally exposed in full light to the American people .

It would be the most severe reprisal , short_of declared war , that the United_States could invoke against Castro .

As a possible course of action , it also is the center of <head>debate</head> and is raising many questions . Among these questions : Military experts say a tight naval_blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task_forces , each built around an aircraft_carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers . The Navy , on April 25 , announced it is bringing_back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean , increasing to four the number of attack_carriers in the vicinity of Cuba .</context>

With_respect_to this view , two points are worth making . First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title_page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' . It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' .</context>
