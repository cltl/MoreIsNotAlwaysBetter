In the Blue_Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting_precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according_to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents .</context>

      <context> Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 . The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New_York 's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . They honored the battling Billikens last night . <head>Speakers</head> at a Tipoff_Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St._Louis_University players who , in the words of Coach_John_Benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' .

      <context> She will sing `` La_Sonambula '' with it here next week . Anyone for musical Ping-pong ? It 's really quite fun_- as_long_as you like games . You will need a stereo music system , with <head>speakers</head> preferably placed at_least seven or eight feet apart , and one or more of the new London `` Phase 4 '' records . There are 12 of these to choose from , all_of them of popular_music except for the star release , Pass_in_Review ( SP 44001 ) . This features the marching songs of several nations , recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing_stand . Complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet_planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays London 's new technique to the best effect .</context>

      <context> Complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet_planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays London 's new technique to the best effect . All_of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program . No reference is made to the possibility of recording other_than popular_music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious_music . Directionality is greatly exaggerated most_of the time ; but when the sounds of the two <head>speakers</head> are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music . You definitely hear some of the instruments close_up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back . This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound . London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels .</context>

      <context> Of_course , something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology : consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and an individual component . But in_general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude . With tone , individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them . Pitch differences from one <head>speaker</head> to another , or from one emotional_state to another , may far exceed the small differences between tones . However , any such suggestion accounts_for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone , or in developing a realistic attitude about tone , but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded . A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands ' paper . Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed .</context>

      <context> Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt_Hall meeting `` brought_together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many_of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' . Seated on the platform were Amos_C._Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; Thomas_Davis , an uncompromising Garrisonian ; the Reverend_Augustus_Woodbury , a Unitarian minister ; the Reverend_George_T._Day , a Free-Will Baptist ; Daniel_w._Vaughan , and William_H._H._Clements . The latter two were appointed secretaries . The first <head>speaker</head> was Amos_C._Barstow who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting . He spoke of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared John_Brown of Harper_'s_Ferry to the John_Brown of Rhode_Island 's colonial period . Barstow concluded that as Rhode_Island 's John_Brown became a canonized hero , if not a saint , so would it be with John_Brown of Harper_'s_Ferry . The next speaker was George_T._Day .</context>

He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments .</context>

      <context> Ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference . Two friends were talking .
