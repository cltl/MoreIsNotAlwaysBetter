      <context> His pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale ; they universalize in_terms_of weather , skies , earth , and people . By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , Roy_Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art . Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all . The artist was_born in Gilbert_Mills , <head>New_York</head> , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California , he lived in western New_York , in Batavia . When I looked_up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 15_th , I realized that Roy was_born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist : the water sign of Pisces ( February 18 - March 20 ) . And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in American_Artist again , in his natal month of March !</context>

And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in American_Artist again , in his natal month of March ! Over the years , beginning in 1929 , Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals ; two Ranger_Fund_purchase_awards ; the Joseph_Pennell_Memorial_Medal ; two American_Watercolor_Society_prizes ; the Blair_Purchase_Prize for watercolor , Art_Institute of Chicago ; and_others in Buffalo , <head>New_York</head> , Chautauqua , New_Haven , Rochester , Rockport , and most_recently , the $ 300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna_Beach_Art_Association , He was elected to the National_Academy_of_Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger_Fund_Purchase_Prize at the Academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to Academicianship in 1940 . Other memberships include the American_Watercolor_Society , Philadelphia_Water_Color_Club , Allied_Artists_of_America , Audubon_Artists , Baltimore_Watercolor_Society .</context>

      <context> Mason had_to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting . Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family_business which , though it was allied to art of a kind - the design and production of engraved seals - bore no relation to the painting of pictures . But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial_art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia . On the death of their father , they returned to their home in Batavia , <head>New_York</head> . After more years of concentrated effort , Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family_business at the old stand . During all this time Roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and_then , as the family_business permitted , for longer periods . Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions .</context>

      <context> Close to two million game_birds were harvested on 1500 commercial and private shooting_preserves , and on State_Game_Commission controlled upland game areas during the 1960 - 61 season . The shooting development program of the Sporting_Arms_and_Ammunition_Manufacturers_'_Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers . The most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting_preserves . This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the <head>New_York</head> staff of the Sportsmen's_Service_Bureau , and the SAAMI shooting_preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 . Following the kick-off of SAAMI 's shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took_place in Washington , D._C. . The group known_as the American_Association_for_Health_,_Physical_Education_,_and_Recreation ( a division of the National_Education_Association ) initiated a conference which brought_together representatives of the National_Rifle_Association , SAAMI and the American_Fishing_Tackle_Manufacturers . This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known_as the Outdoor_Education_Project .</context>

      <context> In 1959 SAAMI 's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports . This program is now nationally known_as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' . Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied_Merchandising_Corporation . The first program was sponsored by Abraham_+_Strauss , Hempstead , <head>New_York</head> , under the direction of Special Events director Jennings_Dennis . Other pilot_programs were conducted by A_+_S , Babylon , New_York ; J._L._Hudson , Detroit ; Joseph_Horne , Pittsburgh .

SAAMI 's field men have served as consultants and / or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40000 enthusiastic young Americans .</context>

      <context> When we arrive_at the events concerned in the vanished majority , they , of_course , cannot impress us as anything familiar . Nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja_vu , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists . If deja_vu is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental_disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people . Chauncey_Depew , one-time runner-up for the Republican Presidential nomination , was attending a convention at Saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel_Theodore_Roosevelt for Governor of <head>New_York</head> when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met . After the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt . If Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja_vu . But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene .</context>
