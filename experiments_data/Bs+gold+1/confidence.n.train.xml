      <context> To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition . But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating . The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave_rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize . It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of <head>confidence</head> to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter_solstice . This and other fears of the solar_system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic_system and its built-in concept of periodicity and_then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions . This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls . In_fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers .</context>

      <context> He imagined they were the kind whose tax_returns were never examined ( if they were , they were never penalized ) , whose children had no unhappy romances , whose names never knew scandal . The equation was simple : wealth brought them happiness , and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had , let no_one in on the secrets . By comparison , Fritzie and Laura_Andrus were quivering fledglings . They possessed no outer fortifications , no hard shells of <head>confidence</head> ; they had enough difficulty getting from day to day , let_alone having an awful crime thrust upon them . Skopas expressed no curiosity over the case , offered no expression of sympathy , made no move to escort McFeeley to the door . All four remained impacted on the sofa until he had left . He had spoken_to Mrs._Emerson the previous day .</context>

      <context> `` Arigato gosaimasu '' . The secretary sighed with relief and_then the telephone clicked in Rector 's hand . Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission . For the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great <head>confidence</head> , and from all the available information it was probably the latter . Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in_order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village . At_the_same_time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out_of mere curiosity . No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived .</context>
