      <context> The Outdoor_Education_Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life . The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and <head>leadership</head> development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach .</context>

      <context> Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such_as the coastal lowlands centering_on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West_Indies than with the North even after independence . The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area . In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old_South . Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no_longer any hope of sharing_in the <head>leadership</head> of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother_country . And no_doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors . All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did .</context>

      <context> Thus , if corporations are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject_to public control and needs . In all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services . Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human_beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests . Such genuine human <head>leadership</head> the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot . It can project long-range goals for itself . Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e._g. , quarterly and annual dividend reports . Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ; corporations , being more amorphous , cannot .</context>

      <context> Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ; corporations , being more amorphous , cannot . Proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community . Corporations are apt by_nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public . The proprietor is able to create a <head>leadership</head> impossible in the corporate structure with its board_of_directors and stockholders . Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop . Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now . Hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest .</context>

      <context> Russell had reached the house as Cook surmised , dismounted , but just as the old trapper opened the door to receive him , he fell into the trapper 's arms - dead . A bullet fired by one of the Mexicans hiding in a little chicken house had passed_through his head , tearing a hole two inches square on the outgoing side . Finding him dead , Cook caught Russell 's horse and rode to the cattle foreman 's house to report the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins . Before daylight Sunday morning , a posse of twenty-three men under the <head>leadership</head> of Deputy_Sheriff_Frank_MacPherson of Catskill followed the trail to the house of Francisco_Chaves , where 100 to 150 Mexicans had gathered . MacPherson boldly approached the fortified adobe_house and demanded entrance . The men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even_though he offered medical_aid . The officer demanded the names of the injured men ; the Mexicans not_only refused to give them , but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it .</context>

      <context> Peasants puzzled Andrei . He wondered how they could go_on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish . Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long_ago . Tolek_Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine and , before the national <head>leadership</head> , exalted the miracles of drying_up swamps and irrigating the desert . A fund-raising_drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched . Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference . Had he found the meaning too late ?</context>
