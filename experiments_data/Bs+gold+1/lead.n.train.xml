      <context> George_Kerr , the swift striding Jamaican , set a meet record in the 600 - yard run in the Knights_of_Columbus track_meet tonight , beating Purdue 's Dave_Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . Kerr , who set the world_record earlier this month in New_York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped_out Mills 's early pace and beat the young Big_10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal_Whitfield . Mills shot out in_front and kept the <head>lead</head> through two thirds of the race . Then Kerr , a graduate_student from Illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held_off Mills 's challenge on the final turn . Mills was timed in 1.10.4 . The crowd at the twenty-first annual K._of_C._Games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a_few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one week old world_record in the half-mile run .</context>

      <context> The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton_Davidson throwing only 17 passes . `` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack '' , explained Stram . `` They can be going_along , doing little damage , then bang , bang - they can hit a_couple_of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in_trouble '' . The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final_period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a <head>lead</head> to hold them off . The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner_Haynes , the flashy halfback . He was called_upon 26 times - more than all_of the other ball carriers combined - and delivered 145 yards . The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver 's Al_Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave_Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al_Reynolds claimed it for Dallas .</context>

      <context> They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American_Association pack . Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley_Hinton in the third inning . He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . The Bears took the <head>lead</head> in the first inning , as they did in Sunday 's opener , and never lagged . Dick_McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don_Rudolph to open the Bear 's attack . After Al_Paschal grounded_out , Jay_Cooke walked and Jim_McDaniel singled home McAuliffe . Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line_drive to left .</context>

      <context> It was Gardner 's second run_batted_in of the game and his only ones of the year . Turk_Lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while Ray_Moore won his second game against a single loss . The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno_Bertoia beat_out a high chopper to third_base and scored on Lenny_Green 's double to left . The White_Sox had taken a 5 - 4 <head>lead</head> in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop_fly hits - a triple by Roy_Sievers and single by Camilo_Carreon - a walk and a sacrifice_fly . Jim_Landis ' 380 - foot home_run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1 - 0 lead , but Harmon_Killebrew came_back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob_Allison aboard . Al_Smith 's 340 - blast over left in the fourth - his fourth homer of the campaign - tied the score and Carreon 's first major_league home_run in the fifth put the Sox back in_front . A double by Green , Allison 's run scoring 2_baser , an infield single by Lemon and Gardner 's solid single to center put the Twins back in_front in the last of the fifth .</context>

      <context> The '52 Cards were 6 - 7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club 's top since 1949 . Then last season the_Birds tumbled as low as 11 - 18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . Since 1949 , the only National_League club that got_off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team . Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game <head>lead</head> by May 8 . The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New_York 's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . They honored the battling Billikens last night . Speakers at a Tipoff_Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St._Louis_University players who , in the words of Coach_John_Benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' .</context>

      <context> It was because of this chain-reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_objects , or at_least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there . Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities . Synthetic_Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this was the_point at which he finally took the <head>lead</head> in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it . But even before that , Picasso had glimpsed and entered , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him . It was as though , in_that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all_the_way back - or forward - to literal three-dimensionality . This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in_general ) literally into the literal space in_front of the picture_plane .</context>

      <context> The previous night 's horror - the absolute failure , overcast with the intrusions of the press , had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness , of play-acting . Sipping their coffee , discussing the weather , the day 's shopping , Fritzie 's commitments at the network ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoided the radio , the morning TV news_show , even the front page of the Santa_Luisa_Register , resting on the kitchen bar . Kidnapper Spurns Ransom ; Amy Still Missing . Once , Andrus walked by it , hastily scanned the bold black headline and the five column <head>lead</head> of the article ( by Duane_Bosch , staff correspondent - age not given ) , and muttered : `` We a buncha national celebrities '' . McFeeley told the parents he would escort them to police_headquarters in a half hour . Before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbors . He did not want_to bring the Andruses to the station_house too early - Rheinholdt had summoned a press_conference , and he did n't want them subjected to the reporters again .</context>

      <context> Eight or ten years ago , a_couple_of French hoods stole a priceless Khmer head from the Musee_Guimet , in Paris , and a week later crawled into the Salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy . Hell 's own amount of chaulmoogra_oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the Blessed_One to forgive their desecration . Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I 'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for_the_moment , let 's resume our catalogue . Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to <head>lead</head> , as a dealer in Khartoum assured me , I am not competent to say . Likewise the ivory Chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance Honan ) ; a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack . The three Indian brass deities , though - Ganessa , Siva , and Krishna - are an altogether different cup_of_tea . They hail from Travancore , a state in the subcontinent where Kali , the goddess of death , is worshiped .</context>
