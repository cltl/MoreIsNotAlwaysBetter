      <context> Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water_cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account_for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug . The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator . The power source was a commercial D.C. rectifier . At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less_than 0.5 V ( <head>peak</head> to peak ) with a resistive load . The current was regulated by_means_of a variable_resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter . The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders . Because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast_resistor was required for stability of operation .</context>

      <context> one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity . These have been labeled Regions 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in Fig. 1 . When the early part of the gradient was flattened , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` cone sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P._J. and R._S. , Fig. 1 and E._M. , Fig. 2 ) . The latter procedure gave_rise to a small active protein <head>peak</head> ( Region 1a ) between Regions 1 and 2 . In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected ( Region 3 , Fig. 1 ) . Moreover , after concentration using negative pressure dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated 2a ( donors P._J. , D._A. , and J._F. , Fig. 1 ) . Not all these regions exhibited equal agglutinating_activity , as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas .</context>

      <context> The temperature then is still very high . At the old nest , the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized eggs that will produce females . As a result , the proportion of males ( which leave the nest ) increases , and eventually the old colony will die_out completely . The nest itself , the structure that in some cases housed about 2000 individuals when the season was at its <head>peak</head> , is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain beetles and moths . Not always , though , does the development of a bumblebee colony take_place in the smooth fashion we have just described . Some members of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives . Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo_bumblebee '' as it is called in some European_countries .</context>

      <context> Underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the Clemence , two gray and white birds slept huddled_together in the cold winter air . John leaned upon the stone balustrade . He brushed back his black hair , shoving it under his pastor 's cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes . Below the moon_splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white <head>peaks</head> ; above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars . He stood very still , his arms at his sides , staring up at the heavens , then down at the blinking lights below . `` How long , my Lord ? How long ?</context>
