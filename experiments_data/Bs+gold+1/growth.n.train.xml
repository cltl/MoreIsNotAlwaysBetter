      <context> This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds . Ants carry_away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby . When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board . A light , porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of <head>growth</head> . I like sawdust for this , or hay . When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants , it 's time to set them out where they are to remain . Every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller .</context>

      <context> Has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yr. ? With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today - and it will be tougher in_the future . Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due_to the demanding combination of qualifications called_for by this type of management work . The <head>growth</head> of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties . Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management_personnel for the longer term ? Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? Every single problem touched_on thus_far is related to good marketing planning .</context>

      <context> The popularity of folklore in America stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in America . And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in_proportion_to the <head>growth</head> of American influence across the world . Thus , if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century , we will do_well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset . Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence . 1 ) Every age rewrites the events of its history in_terms_of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions .</context>

      <context> The thing is that these bees love a fine-grained soil that is moist ; yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either . They dislike dense vegetation . Where does one find such conditions ? The best chance , of_course , is offered by gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry , so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant <head>growth</head> .</context>

      <context> The major weakness of vocational training_programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands . This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country . Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained_workers . All the manuals for setting_up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the <head>growth</head> of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content . Furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys . Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded_as more hypothetical . While the U._S. Department_of_Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning .</context>

      <context> He no_longer sought to find the law ; he made it ; he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be . There was no law , domestic or international , except that willed by , acknowledged by , or consented to by states . Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence . Related_to , but distinguishable from , nationalism was the <head>growth</head> of democracy in one form or another . Increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions . The efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions , particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of industrialization , led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions . Law became a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking_to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms .</context>

      <context> The appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly_line and wants enough land_area to do the entire job on one floor . To light industry , the economies of being on one floor are much slighter , but efficiency_engineers usually believe_in them , and manufacturers looking_for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning_to efficiency_engineers . This movement of industry away from the central_cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe . It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog <head>growth</head> which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities . The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities - the rubber factories in Akron , Chrysler 's Detroit plants , U._S._Steel 's Pittsburgh works - often began on these sites at_a_time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( piers ) and power ( river ) . The `` leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam_turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not_yet blighted . The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in selecting his plant site .</context>
