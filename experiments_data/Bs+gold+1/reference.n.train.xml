      <context> The total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts . It was calculated from the temperature_gradient **f at **f inch as **f . The total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby **f The temperature distribution of figure 4 gives **f for all blowing rates , assuming **f . The temperature dependent value of |e was taken from <head>Ref.</head> 7 . The radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according_to **f where **f is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures **f and **f calculated analogously to equation ( 1 ) .</context>

      <context> 2 . Heat transfer by molecular conduction as_well_as by radiation from the arc column . The heat transfer to the anode in free_burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas_jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up **f . This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated in_detail by Maecker ( <head>Ref.</head> 1 ) . The pressure gradient producing the jet is_due to the nature of the magnetic_field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) . Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free_burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point . it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free_burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode .</context>

      <context> Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic_forces . 3 . Feed_back of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode . The third method was , to our knowledge , successfully applied for_the_first_time by C._Sheer and co-workers ( <head>Ref.</head> 2 ) . The purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as_well_as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage . Gas injection through a porous anode ( transpiration cooling ) not_only feeds_back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself . A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper .</context>

      <context> Sintered porous metals should be usable in_principle . However , technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots . The experimental arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free_burning arcs . Thus , direct comparisons can be drawn with free_burning arcs which have been studied in_detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( <head>Ref.</head> 3 ) . Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder . The cathode consisted_of a 1/4 '' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water_cooled copper tube . This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing .</context>

      <context> If the volume is the molal volume , then * * f is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists . Although the * * f calculation is obvious by_analogy_with that for gravitational_field and osmotic_pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects . Consider a shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of h ( referred to the same base as H ) and a cross-sectional area of a . If * * f is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and |r is the density of the fluid , then the total potential_energy of the system above the <head>reference</head> height is * * f . * * f is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h . The total volume of the system above the reference height is * * f , and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential_energy of the system in_terms_of H . The minimum total potential_energy is found by taking the derivative with_respect_to H and equating to zero .</context>

      <context> The O atoms in each sheet are close_packed and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of O atoms . The **f layers are stacked normal to the [ 111 ] axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers . The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen_bonds . A drawing of the structure is to be_found in <head>reference</head> 6 . The gross details of the structure appear reasonable . The structure appears to be unique among ROOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by **f . The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal .</context>

      <context> The DEAE-cellulose , containing 0.78 mEq of N / g , was prepared in our laboratory by the method of Peterson and Sober ( 7 ) from powdered cellulose , 100 - 230 mesh . The small amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting_buffer , centrifuged , resuspended in 2.5 ml of isotonic saline and tested for antibody activity . The chromatography was done at 6 ` C using gradient elution , essentially according_to Sober and Peterson . The deep concave gradient employed ( fig. 2 ) was obtained with a nine chambered gradient elution device ( `` Varigrad '' , <head>reference</head> ( 8 ) ) and has been described elsewhere . the other , a shallow concave gradient ( Fig. 1 ) , was produced with a so-called `` cone sphere '' apparatus , the `` cone '' being a 2 - liter Erlenmeyer_flask and the `` sphere , '' a 2 - liter round-bottom flask . Each initially contained 1700 ml of buffer ; in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer , 0.50 M in both * * f and Tris , pH 4.1 . A flow_rate of 72 * * f was used and 12 ml fractions were collected .</context>

      <context> The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 ) . Whether this abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH , or is , alternatively , normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible_for the blood activity with pituitary TSH . In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them . The introduction of the United_States_Pharmacopoeia <head>reference</head> standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid stimulating activity have made_it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time . We should_like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in_terms_of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units . For_the_most_part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard . The international unit ( u . ) , adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different laboratories ( Mussett and Perry , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the International_Standard_Preparation .</context>

      <context> But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or mess-hall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond . These letters became the center of my existence . I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer . My memory has catalogued for easy <head>reference</head> and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when '' ; and_others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commencing again her piano_lessons , her private_school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe . In my letters I took_on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real_life . Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after_school class I was enrolled . The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young_man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot_Sands - he of the porch steps anecdotes - who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked_off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them .</context>

      <context> This clergyman should have referred to Shakespeare 's dictum : `` So-so is a good , very good , very excellent maxim . And yet it is not . It is but so-so '' . Indefinite <head>reference</head> also carries double meaning where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer to another . A news item described the launching of a ship : `` Completing the ceremony , the beautiful movie_star smashed a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slid gracefully down the ways into the sea '' . This is not unlike the order received by the sergeant of an army motor_pool : `` Four trucks to Fort_Mason gym , 7 : 30 tonight , for hauling girls to dance . The bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped_off '' .</context>
