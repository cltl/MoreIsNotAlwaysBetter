      <context> Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double_play . Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting_up Tuttle 's 390 - foot homer over the wall in left center . If the Orioles are to break their losing_streak within the next two days , it will have to be at_the_expense_of the American_League champion New_York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night_game and a single test Sunday afternoon . The flavor of Baltimore 's Florida_Grapefruit_League <head>news</head> ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron_Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army 's military training_program and is ready for belated spring_training . Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove_in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average , completes the Birds ' spring squad at 49 players . The big , 22 - year old shortstop , the 1960 American_league `` rookie of the year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $ 15000 and was a spectator at tonight 's 5 - to 3 loss to Kansas_City - the winless Birds ' sixth setback in_a_row . The 6 - foot 3 inch Hansen checked_in close_to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting_weight last spring .</context>

      <context> Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities . I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town . I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in_detail , from the hodge-podge of <head>news</head> pictures I have seen . And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious_mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence . The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ?</context>

Because of this he was known_as Gimpy ( but , as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface , never in his presence ) . In his teens O_'_Banion was enrolled in the vicious Market_Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's_Cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North_Clark_Street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown_out . He then got a job with the Chicago_Herald-Examiner as a circulation_slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper 's <head>news</head> pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors . He was also at_the_same_time gaining practical experience as a safe_breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene_Geary , later committed to Chester_Asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor . O_'_Banion 's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell_Prison for three months for burglary ; two years later he served another three months for assault . Those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery .</context>

It is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere - about 30 per_cent of the women and 25 per_cent of the men in the graduating_class - the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed_up the estimate . `` Almost everybody in the senior_class is married '' , students say dogmatically . And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the House_Plan_Association ) that have good <head>news</head> to impart .

      <context> The property sales assistance program is designed to assist small business_concerns that may wish to buy property offered for sale by the Federal_Government . Under this program , property sales specialists in the Small_Business_Administration regional offices help small business_concerns to locate Federal property for_sale and insure that small firms have the opportunity to bid competitively for surplus personal and real_property and certain natural_resources , including timber from the national forests . SBA works closely with the principal property disposal installations of the Federal_Government in reviewing proposed sales programs and identifying those types of property that small business_concerns are most likely to be interested in purchasing . Proposed property sales of general interest to small business_concerns are publicized through SBA regional <head>news</head> releases , and by `` flyers '' directed to the small business_concerns . Each SBA regional office also maintains a `` want '' list of surplus property , principally machinery and equipment , desired by small business_concerns in its area . When suitable equipment is_located by the SBA representative , the small business_concern is contacted and advised on when , where , and how to bid on such property . Section 8 ( b ) ( 2 ) of the Small_Business_Act , as amended , authorizes the SBA to make a complete inventory of the productive facilities of small business_concerns .</context>

      <context> The Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace . On October 31 , 1859 , John_Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder . For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in_public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 . Upon receiving the <head>news</head> , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia . Although Rhode_Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John_Brown 's trial with extreme interest . On Wednesday morning , November_2 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fairer trial . The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted .</context>

And how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause ! And thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity , Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks . All these emotions were screwed_up to new heights when , after acceptance and the first rehearsals , there ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian music_lovers that Duclos had_to come running to Rousseau to inform him that the <head>news</head> had reached the superintendent of the King 's amusements , and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of Fontainebleau . Imagine the honor of_it ! `` What was your answer '' ? Jean_Jacques asked , striving to appear unimpressed .</context>

And of_course the <head>news</head> of who the composer was did finally begin to get_around among his closest friends . But they , naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at_large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles . How titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals . The furor was such_that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational .</context>

Now she could let out the three parakeets without_fear they would be stepped_on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors ; she could dust the plants , then break_off suddenly and pick_up an old novel and read from the middle on ; improvise cha-chas on the harp ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers , reading the ads as_well_as the <head>news</head> , registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire . She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting_to be . She fell_asleep leaning_on her hand , hearing the house creaking as_though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm . Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers .</context>

Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after_school class I was enrolled .
