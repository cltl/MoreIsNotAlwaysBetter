      <context> Vandiver likely will mention the $ 100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . Meanwhile , it was learned the State_Highway_Department is very near being ready to issue the first $ 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test_suit to test the validity of the act , and_then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway_Department source said there also is a <head>plan</head> there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural_Roads_Authority bonds for rural road construction work . The department apparently intends to make the Rural_Roads_Authority a revolving_fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid_off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov._Marvin_Griffin . The Highway_Department source told The_Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds .</context>

Schley_County_Rep._B._D._Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body 's action of Friday in voting itself a $ 10 per day increase in expense allowances . Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought . While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked_out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set_aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87 - 31 .</context>

Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it 's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash_register .

      <context> The real question that follows is - how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? The American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course . An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior_design , for_the_most_part schools accredited by membership in the National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art , and a further `` on_the_spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations . One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four year <head>plan</head> which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions . The suggested course of the A.I.D. was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities . Obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated . Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses - architecture versus interior_design - let us examine the educational needs of the interior_designer .</context>

      <context> Mr._Speaker , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have . The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex - high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two . And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all_the_way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service . There have been a number of sound <head>plans</head> proposed . But none of these has been implemented . Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping_hand . Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each_day has increased tremendously since World_War_2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957 .</context>

On motion of the amici_curiae , the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner_of_Internal_Revenue as to the federal income_tax consequences of the Government 's <head>plan</head> . On May 9 , 1958 , the Commissioner announced his rulings . The annual dividends paid to du_Pont stockholders in shares of General_Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of du_Pont 's earnings and profits . The measure , for federal income_tax purposes , of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market_value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution .</context>

The forced_sale of the General_Motors stock owned by or allocable to Christiana , Delaware , and the stockholders of Delaware , and deposited with the trustee , would result in a tax to those parties at the capital_gains rate . Du_Pont 's counterproposal was filed on May 14 , 1958 . Under its <head>plan</head> du_Pont would retain its General_Motors shares but be required to pass_on to its stockholders the right_to_vote those shares . Christiana and Delaware would , in_turn , be required to pass_on the voting_rights to the General_Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders . Du_Pont would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General_Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of du_Pont could serve as a director of General_Motors without court approval . Du_Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General_Motors stock except through General_Motors ' distributions of stock or subscription_rights to its stockholders .</context>

      <context> Du_Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General_Motors stock except through General_Motors ' distributions of stock or subscription_rights to its stockholders . On June 6 , 1958 , General_Motors submitted its objections to the Government 's proposal . It argued , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both General_Motors and du_Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; that the tremendous volume of General_Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General_Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity . General_Motors comprehensively contended that the Government <head>plan</head> would not be `` in the public interest '' as_required by the mandate of_this Court . The decrees proposed by the amici_curiae were filed in August of 1958 . These plans , like du_Pont 's contained provisions for passing the vote on du_Pont 's General_Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their spouses , and other people living in their households , as_well_as other specified persons , were to be totally disenfranchised .

Considering the high cost of the F-108 system - over $ 4 billion for the force that had been planned - and the time_period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project .

Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic_missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and deployed , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental_ballistic_missile .

Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends .
