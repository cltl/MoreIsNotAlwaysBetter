      <context> This dissatisfaction led to Howsam 's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game . The powerful New_York Yankees won their 19th world_series in a 5 - game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13 - 5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale . With Mickey_Mantle and Yogi_Berra both out_of_action due_to injuries , the American_League champs still mounted a 15 - hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game . Johnny_Blanchard , Mantle 's <head>replacement</head> , slammed a 2 - run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey_Jay in a 5 - run first inning . Hector_Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3 - run homer off Bill_Henry during another 5 - run explosion in the fourth . The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors . The crowd of 32589 had only two chances to applaud .</context>

      <context> Check your cafeteria location to make sure it 's convenient for most employees . You may save valuable production minutes with a change . Spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two_weeks . This will cut the expense of vacation <head>replacements</head> . And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates . Also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation . You might try providing standard vacation time_off but make the vacation pay depend_on the number of hours worked in the previous year .</context>

      <context> The coronary_arteries were sclerotic and diffusely narrowed throughout their courses , and the right_coronary_artery was virtually occluded by a yellow atheromatous plaque 1.5 cm. distal to its origin . The myocardium of the posterior base of the left_ventricle was replaced by gray scar tissue over a 7.5 cm. area . The valves were normal except for thin yellow plaques on the inferior surface of the mitral leaflets . Microscopically , sections from the posterior base of the left_ventricle of the heart showed several large areas of <head>replacement</head> of muscle by fibrous_tissue . In_addition , other sections contained focal areas of recent myocardial necrosis that were infiltrated with neutrophils . Many of the myocardial fibers were hypertrophied and had large , irregular , basophilic nuclei . The intima of the larger coronary_arteries was thickened by fibrous_tissue containing fusiform clefts and mononuclear cells .</context>

      <context> These changes were more marked in the atrophic right kidney than in the left . In_addition , there were 2 small papillary adenomas in the right kidney . The bone of the vertebral bodies , ribs , and sternum was soft and was easily compressed . The marrow of the vertebral bodies was pale and showed areas of fatty <head>replacement</head> . Microscopically , there were many areas of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity . The cells of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic series were normal except for their numbers . There was no evidence of fibrosis .</context>

      <context> 22 % of his total list as against 3.5 % in mine . Or the exception may be_due to a particular durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb . More word_class ratios determined in more languages will no_doubt ultimately answer the question . If word_classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem <head>replacement</head> within meaning slot , it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans lingually . Hoijer 's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings ( with allowance for several near synonyms like stomach belly , big large , long far , many much , die dead , say speak ) . For Yokuts , I tabulated these 71 items in five columns , according_as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more_than 4 stems . The totals for these five categories are not too uneven , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively .</context>
