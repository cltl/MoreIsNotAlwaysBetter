      <context> Television has yet to work_out a living_arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family . There seems to be an unfortunate <head>assumption</head> that an hour of Chicago style jazz in prime evening time , for_example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary . At_least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' , presented on NBC - TV Nov. 26 . The program came_out of the NBC Special Projects department , and was slotted in the Du_Pont_Show of the Week series . Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines .</context>

These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism .</context>

      <context> And if he is so scornful of the rights of states , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ? I am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal 's attitude toward the South . It appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends . His <head>assumption</head> seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at_least partly in_sympathy_with his views . Time 's editor , Thomas_Griffith , in his book , The Waist High Culture , wrote : `` most of what was different about it ( the Deep_South ) I found myself unsympathetic to '' . This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement . Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism .</context>

      <context> Therefore , neglecting the extreme outbursts , reflected solar_radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter - and decimeter wave-length range . Radio_observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave_lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm , and the results are summarized in Table 1 . Observations have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques ( Sinton , 1955 , 1956 , ; see_also chap. 11 ) . Not all the observers have used the same procedures or made the same <head>assumptions</head> about the lunar brightness distribution when reducing the data , and this , together with differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers , must account_for much of the disagreement in the measured radio_brightness temperatures . In the observations at 4.3 mm ( Coates , 1959 a ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , 6 ' .7 , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface , and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases . These observations indicate that the lunar maria heat_up more rapidly and also cool_off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions . Mare_Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it .</context>

      <context> The relation between osmotic_pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way . In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics_of_equilibrium ( referred to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady state . This can be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared . This has an interesting analogy with the <head>assumption</head> stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' . There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed_out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar . If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar . The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference * * f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear .</context>

      <context> ( B ) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions . ( C ) The kinetic effects are negligible . ( D ) Since the shape of the drop conforms_to the force field , it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid . These are reasonable <head>assumptions</head> with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear . Just as the pressure exerted by surface_tension in a spherical drop is * * f and the pressure exerted by surface_tension on a cylindrical shape is * * f , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is * * f , where |g is the interfacial_tension and * * f and * * f are the two radii_of_curvature . This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason . If a is the major_axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes , the radius_of_curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis is * * f , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axes is * * f .</context>

      <context> One sees that this happens because the null_space of * * f has dimension 1 only . On_the_other_hand , the null_space of * * f and the null_space of * * f together span V , the former being the subspace spanned by * * f and the latter the subspace spanned by * * f and * * f . This will be more_or_less our general method for the second problem . If ( remember this is an <head>assumption</head> ) the minimal polynomial for T decomposes * * f where * * f are distinct elements of F , then we shall show that the space V is the direct_sum of the null_spaces of * * f . The diagonalizable operator is the special case of this in which * * f for each i .

      <context> The great majority of present-day linguists fall_into one or more of a number of overlapping types : those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed , those who are personally scared of tone and tone_languages generally , those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter . The result has been neglect , fumbling efforts , or superficial treatment . As these maladies overlap , so must the cure . Analyses such_as these four will simultaneously combat the <head>assumptions</head> that tone is impossible and that it is simple . They will give suggestions that can be worked_up into field procedures . Good field techniques will not_only equip linguists for better work , but also help them overcome negative attitudes .

      <context> For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs . Productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time_period is not even well_known to the industry , much_less to the union or to the public . Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit_margins related to a productivity increase should be shared . The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the <head>assumption</head> that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity share increases as distinct from a cost raising increase in the basic wage rate . We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price level increases may offset wage rate increases , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate . For internal political reasons , the union asks for ( and accepts ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up_to the discretion of the companies of the industry . Changes in the basic wage rate are cost raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices .</context>

      <context> The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . In_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells_out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages . Part 1 , below describes this abstract model by spelling_out its <head>assumptions</head> . Part 2 , discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant conclusions . Part 3 , discusses the empirical relevance and policy implications of the conclusions . Part 4 , is a brief summary .</context>

      <context> Part 2 , discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant conclusions . Part 3 , discusses the empirical relevance and policy implications of the conclusions . Part 4 , is a brief summary . The Mathematical Appendix presents the rigorous argument , but is best read after Part 1 , in_order that the <head>assumptions</head> underlying the equations may be explicit . The industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry , producing a substantial share of gross_national_product . Price_competition is lacking . For the purposes of setting the product price , the industry behaves as a single entity .</context>
