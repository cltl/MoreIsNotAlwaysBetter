      <context> This is when his troubles begin , not_to_mention a fledgling artist who he hires , and who turns_out to have ideas of his own , with particular respect_to the hero 's sweetheart secretary . John_Heffernan , playing Larry_Larkin , the cartoonist , carries_the_show in marvelous fashion . His portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless . This may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of David_Hedison , Providence 's <head>contribution</head> to Hollywood , who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th_Century-Fox . Not that Mr._Hedison does not make the most of his role . He does , and more . But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way .</context>

      <context> This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced . And although Schnabel 's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert 's dynamic markings and phrase indications . The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives . About the Pro_Arte 's <head>contribution</head> I am less happy . I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group . From a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro_Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here . The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy .</context>

      <context> Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought_out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout . Some of Curzon 's playing strikes me as finicky , however . Why , for_example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ? The assisting musicians from the Vienna_Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their <head>contribution</head> is rustic and appealing . ( Special compliments to the double_bass playing of Johann_Krumpp : his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance . ) The Glazer-Fine_Arts edition ( Concert-Disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization .</context>

      <context> At its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares . Everything else is closed away . This is the ideal . But marriage experts say that such mutual <head>contribution</head> and mutual joy are seldom achieved . Instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual_relationship . In the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive . But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed .</context>

      <context> We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter - the two-way B. +_O._-_C._+ O. merger , or the three_way New_York_Central B._+_O._-_C._+_O. merger . Which will serve not_only the best interest of the stockholders , but the interests of all the traveling public ? Mr._Speaker , I rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper , the New_York_Times , on the occasion of a major change in its top_executive command . Arthur_Hays_Sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major <head>contribution</head> to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement . I am pleased to note that Mr._Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman_of_the_board of the New_York_Times . Mr._Sulzberger 's successor as publisher is Mr._Orvil_E._Dryfoos , who is president of the New_York_Times_Co. , and who has been with the Times since 1942 . Mr._Dryfoos ' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world 's great newspapers will be maintained .</context>

      <context> Every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer . Unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present . The movement of events is so fast , the pace so severe , that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present . If there is anything which we can do in the executive_branch of the Government to speed_up the processes by which we come_to decisions on matters on_which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major <head>contribution</head> to the conduct of our affairs . Action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control . There will of_course be times for delay and inaction . What I am suggesting is that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties .</context>

      <context> One other paper deals with a phonologic problem : Vowel_Harmony_in_Igbo , by J._Carnochan . This restates the already widely known facts in_terms_of prosodies . As a restatement it makes only a small <head>contribution</head> to knowledge of Igbo . But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of Igbo phonology . The paper has a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach , particularly since it treats a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional ( though not structural ) statement . It does show one feature of the system that has not been previously described .</context>

      <context> Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence , which weights not_only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative_frequency . Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is : stem identical in 8 languages , 100 % ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86 % ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , 64 % ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57 % . His formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material . But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; and Gleason presumably is on_the_way with a further <head>contribution</head> in this area . As to relative_frequencies of competing roots ( 7 - 1 vs. 4 - 4 , etc_. ) , Thomas with his ' weighting ' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have . The problem needs further exploration . I was at_least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication , in which , in listing ' Two_Stem_Meanings ' , I set_off by asterisks those forms in which n of stem B was * * f of stem A_3 , the unasterisked ones standing_for * * f ; or under ' Four_Stems ' , I set_off by asterisks cases where the combined n of stems * * f was * * f .</context>

      <context> Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here presented . The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price_competition , but which is so basic that its wage price policies are held in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . The <head>contribution</head> of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . In_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells_out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages . Part 1 , below describes this abstract model by spelling_out its assumptions .</context>

      <context> Wage price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces - no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant <head>contribution</head> to explaining the wage price behavior of a_few very important industries . While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United_States since World_War_2 , . Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here presented .

In_fact , he intimated clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had been sent here - to make a larger contribution of dollar money . Wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was , they must have a better church , a more business-like conduct of the church organization , and an effort to get this religious center out_of its rut of wild worship into a modern church organization . He emphasized to the Presiding_Elder the plan of giving_up the old church and moving across the river .</context>
