      <context> Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , he purchased great blocks of the Company's stock with the view to controlling its policies . Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116000 square_miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . The grant , which stretched southward to Lake_Traverse - the headwaters of the Red - was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York_Factory on Hudson_Bay . Thus at the same time that William_Henry_Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana_Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon <head>settlement</head> made a great leap into the center of the North_American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier . Seven hundred miles south of York_Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 . By October the little colony about Fort_Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 . Within a_few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called Meurons .</context>

      <context> For many years the Northwest_Company had its southern headquarters at Prairie_du_Chien on the Mississippi_River , some 300 miles southeast of present-day St._Paul , Minnesota . When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United_States , its British born employees , now become American citizens - Joseph_Rolette , Joseph_Renville and Alexis_Bailly - continued in the fur business . On Big_Stone_Lake near the headwaters of the Red_River , Robert_Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian_Department of Canada , had a trading_post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces . His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red_River and from Selkirk's <head>settlement</head> he brought them south in carts . These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander_Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk colony was begun . In 1802 Henry referred to `` our new carts '' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much_as a horse could pack . They were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills .</context>
