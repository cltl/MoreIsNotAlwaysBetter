      <context> The Bayreuth_Festival opens July 23 with a new production of `` Tannhaeuser '' staged by Wieland_Wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by Wolfgang_Sawallisch . Sawalisch also conducts `` The_Flying_Dutch '' , opening July 24 . `` Parsifal '' follows July 25 , with Hans_Knappertsbusch conducting , and he also conducts `` Die_Meistersinger '' , to be presented Aug. 8 and 12 . The `` Ring '' <head>cycles</head> are July 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and Aug. 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 . Rudolf_Kempe conducts . No casts are listed , but Lotte_Lehmann sent_word that the Negro soprano , Grace_Bumbry , will sing Venus in `` Tannhaeuser '' . Remember how BY a series of booking absurdities Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi_Ballet ?</context>

      <context> To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition . But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating . The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave_rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize . It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly <head>cycle</head> did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter_solstice . This and other fears of the solar_system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic_system and its built-in concept of periodicity and_then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions . This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls . In_fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers .</context>

      <context> No attempts to measure the radio_emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small diameters , or low_temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave_lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity . In_spite of this , the very large radio_reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio_emission of most of the planets in a_few years . The study of the radio_emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25 - cm wave_length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 ) . This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25 - cm emission of the moon over three lunar <head>cycles</head> by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) . They deduced from their measurements that the radio_emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less_than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared_emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio_emission came about 3 - 1 2 days after Full_Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared_emission , which reaches its maximum at Full_Moon . Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing_out that rocklike materials which are likely to make_up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio_waves , although opaque to infrared_radiation . The infrared_emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due_to solar_radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase .</context>

      <context> Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water_cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account_for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug . The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator . The power source was a commercial D.C. rectifier . At 100 Amp the 360 <head>cycle</head> ripple was less_than 0.5 V ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load . The current was regulated by_means_of a variable_resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter . The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders . Because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast_resistor was required for stability of operation .</context>

      <context> Whosoever violates our rooftree , the legend states , can expect maximal sorrow . The teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles , his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers , and a trolley_car will grow in his stomach . Furthermore - and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note - it shall avail the vandals naught to throw_away or dispose of their loot . The <head>cycle</head> of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation . Sort_of remorseless , is n't it ? Still , there it is . Now , you no_doubt regard the preceding as pap ; you 're tooling_around full of gage in your hot_rods , gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like Ubermenschen .</context>
