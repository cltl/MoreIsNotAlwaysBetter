      <context> Skorich began his new job auspiciously today . At a ceremony in the reception_room of Mayor_Richardson_Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William_A._Bill_Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night 's thirty-eighth annual <head>dinner</head> and show of the New_York Chapter , Baseball_Writers_Association_of_America , at the Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel .

      <context> Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 . The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New_York 's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . They honored the battling Billikens last night . Speakers at a Tipoff_Club <head>dinner</head> dealt lavish praise to a group of St._Louis_University players who , in the words of Coach_John_Benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' . The most_valuable_player award was split three ways , among Glen_Mankowski , Gordon_Hartweger and Tom_Kieffer . In_addition , a special award was given to Bob_(_Bevo_) Nordmann , the 6 - foot - 10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury . `` You often hear people talk_about team_spirit and that sort of thing '' , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a_little different .</context>

      <context> Thus , in `` The_Story_of_Ruth '' we have Ruth , Naomi , and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic . But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline - i.e. , that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound_up with Boaz - the film version has little to do with the Bible . And in the new `` King_of_Kings '' the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the Gospels . Earlier this month Edward_R._Murrow , director of the United_States_Information_Agency , came to Hollywood and had <head>dinner</head> with more_than 100 leaders of the motion_picture industry . He talked_about unauthentic storylines too . He intimated that they were n't doing the country much good in the Cold_War . And to an industry that prides itself on authenticity , he urged greater realism .</context>

      <context> Certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking . Bob_Carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to LaGuardia as Tom_Bosley does , but I was amazed at the way he became more_and_more Fiorello as the evening progressed , until one had to catch_one's_self_up and remember that this was n't really LaGuardia come_back among us again . Then Rudy_Bond was simply grand as Ben , the distraught Republican_Party district chieftain . And Paul_Lipson , as Morris , the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley 's <head>dinner</head> , was fine , too . As for the ladies , they were full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man . Charlotte_Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie , who became the second Mrs._LaGuardia , singing and acting with remarkable conviction . Jen_Nelson , as Thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive .</context>

      <context> In_fact , O_'_Connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $ 2500 diamond stickpin . There was a brief interruption while one of O_'_Banion 's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip . Then O_'_Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds . This <head>dinner</head> was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more_or_less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek_by_jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928_-_29 '' . However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever . O_'_Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal .</context>

      <context> He had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah . But Mercer hung_on , living , after_a_fashion , in a Greenwich_Village fourth flight walk-up . `` The place had no sink or washbasin , only a bathtub '' , his mother discovered when she visited him . `` Johnny insisted on cooking a chicken <head>dinner</head> in my honor - he 's always been a good cook - and I 'll never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub '' . A story , no_doubt apocryphal , for Mercer himself denies it , has him sporting a monocle in those Village days . Though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade_mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers . One day in a bar , so the legend goes , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monocle and broke it .</context>

      <context> The chief , annoyed by these questions , knocks Voltaire down and shouts at him that he not_only never went_to any school , but never even learned how to read .

For it is such a distinguished place , with such fine works_of_art and such a big library , that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become depraved by all this culture . To Voltaire 's surprise , however , their host gives them fresh clothes to put_on , opens his purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good <head>dinner</head> . Immediately after dinner , however , Rousseau asks for still another favor . Could he have pen and paper , please ? He is in a hurry to write another essay against culture .</context>

Then she went_back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water . `` My nephews will be coming_down '' , she said that evening as Angelina brought her <head>dinner</head> into the dining_room , the whole meal on a vast linen covered tray . She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years ; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had faded to a near absence of color which had , possibly from her constant looking_at the water , something of the light of the sea in them . Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew_off the cloth . She smiled , and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face .</context>

      <context> She was forty-nine at this time , a lanky woman of breeding with an austere , narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long_ago for a stubborn sort of prayer . Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders . There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the startled horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are_born at the end of an ancestral line long_since divorced from money-making and which , besides , has kept its estate intact . She was personally sloppy , and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist , and when she gardened she would eat <head>dinner</head> with dirt on her calves . But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come_down bathed , brushed , and taking_breaths of air , and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy , a grace of history , so_to_speak , and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value . She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp . `` Now drive carefully , for_God's_sake '' ! she called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure .</context>

She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting_to be . She fell_asleep leaning_on her hand , hearing the house creaking as_though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm . Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for <head>dinner</head> and bringing three guests of hers . Then she fell_asleep again as suddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes . She stood_up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming_in or going_out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in_a_moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests . She went_into the living_room and turned_on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned_on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway .</context>
