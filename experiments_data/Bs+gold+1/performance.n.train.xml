      <context> It was the first time we 've been ahead this season ( when John_Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field_goal ) '' . Assistant coach John_Cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , I think , on the part of the coaches and the players . We needed it and we got it '' . Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive <head>performances</head> of end Happy_Nelson and halfback Billy_Gannon . Both turned_in top jobs for the second straight game . `` Nelson played magnificent football '' , Meek praised . `` He knocked_down the interference and made key stops lots_of times .</context>

Yes , with Bob_Grove , Carl_Hubbell , Herb_Pennock , Art_Nehf , Vernon_Gomez , et_al . Spahn not_only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball_player 's ball_player , as they say in the trade . I remember his beardown <head>performance</head> in a meaningless exhibition_game at Bears_Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18792 . `` Spahnie does n't know how to merely go_through_the_motions '' , remarked Enos_Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse . The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big_leagues come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home_runs in a span of nine innings . Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience .</context>

      <context> We 'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say , ' Do n't worry , Coach - we 'll get 'em all_right '' ' . The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob_Broeg , sports_editor of the Post-Dispatch . Kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as_well as his all-round excellent play . Mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his <head>performance</head> against Bradley in St._Louis_U. 's nationally televised victory . Benington said , `` I 've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day '' . Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills . After the coach listed all the boy 's faults , Hartweger said , `` Coach before I leave here , you 'll get to like me '' .</context>

      <context> But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems . Since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall_into the category of chamber_music - yet it calls_for a double_bass , an instrument generally regarded_as symphonic . Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather_than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . The many and frequent <head>performances</head> of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing . Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free_rein . Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation . In these readings , the double_bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown 's attire - the musical equivalent of a bull_in_a_china_shop .</context>

      <context> As a boy Roy_Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods . His father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting_expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature . Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on_the_wing - almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . It is this subject_matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional <head>performance</head> with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors . Mason had_to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting . Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family_business which , though it was allied to art of a kind - the design and production of engraved seals - bore no relation to the painting of pictures . But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial_art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia .</context>

      <context> Isolated enterprises have been launched , but they are not_yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern . The society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector , with very poor communications between the two . Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted . Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social_system without the modern standards of <head>performance</head> required to make them effective . In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them - and that with independence free_men do not have_to work to realize the benefits of modern life . For_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement .</context>

      <context> American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies . We should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call_for effort as_well_as enthusiasm . Above_all , we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible_for their fates . Only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of <head>performance</head> can we provide telling assistance . With_respect_to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their illusions , we can afford to wait , for in_time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see . Our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments . We should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities , state and provincial governments , rural communities , and other smaller groups , making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected .</context>

      <context> ( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade . Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line_of_work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation requiring a great_deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour . It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more_than the foregoing facts [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the <head>performance</head> capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , - that_is , from one end to the other - was unimpaired '' . If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense_of_touch can be explained by his defective visual condition . But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at_hand . In what ways , then , did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself ?</context>

The hen appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle_down to the <head>performance</head> of them . One part of her audience was totally engaged , the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the connoisseur , attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in_that which he does not fully understand . The spectacle progressed towards a denouement which was obviously still remote ; the audience attended . Time elapsed but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature .</context>

      <context> After a_few tortuous moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that Neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in_the_eyes_of a mute piece of sculpture . The effect , needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at_times a_bit obscure , the film is certainly a much needed catharsis for the `` repressed '' movie-goer . THE MUSIC OF BINI_SALFININISTAS , CAPITAL_LP 63711 - R , one of the rare recordings of this titanic , yet unsung , composer . Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the <head>performance</head> of his work at the Brest-Silevniov_Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach lay_dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas passed_through his `` purgatory '' of neglect . But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc_Schlek_, Jr. , a major revival is under_way . As he leads the Neurenschatz_Skolkau_Orchestra , Schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor 's insistence . A major portion of the credit should also go to flautist Haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` Indianapolis '' movement in the Baslot .</context>
