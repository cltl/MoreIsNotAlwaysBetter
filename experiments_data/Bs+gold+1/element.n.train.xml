      <context> Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement . Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes . In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose . A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an <head>element</head> of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever_changing land . But we must never forget , most_of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends . Parson_Weems 's George_Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting States . Abraham_Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution .</context>

      <context> This is the rate of projection ; it is also the rate of photographing . Time is built into the motion_picture , which cannot exist without time . Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end - elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence . The `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to_be_sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; the cinematic <head>element</head> of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo . In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film . Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time . This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician 's tricks produced on film .</context>

      <context> An exhaustive survey was made of the literature , and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued . Selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation . A wall stabilized high current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen . This apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large_number of other <head>elements</head> . A study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about * * f percent . A set of tables containing spectral intensities for 39000 lines of 70 elements , as observed in a copper matrix in a d-c arc , was completed and published . Studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities .</context>

      <context> The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called_in and notices of further investigation appeared from_time_to_time . In January , 1958 , the Minister_of_the_Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied . In late 1957 the M.P. ( Mouvement_Populaire ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council_of_Government under Balafrej was formed without support from progressive <head>elements</head> in the party . The parties were on_the_whole unprepared for elections , while the people were still experiencing post independence let-down and suffering the after_effects of poor harvests in 1957 . Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue . They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held .</context>
