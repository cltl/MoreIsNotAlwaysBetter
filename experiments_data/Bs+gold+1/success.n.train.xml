      <context> But if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously . Not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the Soviet sphere . Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent_on following compulsively in his footsteps . When one powerful nation strives to emulate the <head>success</head> of another , it is only natural . Thus , when the Russians sent up their first sputnik , American chagrin was human enough , and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable . But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly . When East_Germans fled to the West by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists .</context>

      <context> We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano_sonatas , chamber_music , gavottes , and marches ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities . We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers . Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms . So young Prokofieff was the darling of <head>success</head> : in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting_grounds of `` Uncle_Sam '' ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought . Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing . In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native_land .</context>

      <context> The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the <head>success</head> of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach . In 1959 SAAMI 's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports .</context>

      <context> These thermometers have now been sent to the United_Kingdom for calibration at the National_Physical_Laboratory . During the last week of march 1961 , Columbus , Ohio was the site of the Fourth_Symposium_on_Temperature , Its_Measurement_and_Control_in_Science_and_Industry . The Symposium , which was jointly sponsored by the American_Institute_of_Physics , the Instrument_Society_of_America , and the National_Bureau_of_Standards , attracted nearly one_thousand registrants , including many from abroad . The Bureau contributed to the planning and <head>success</head> of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr._W._A._Wildhack , General_Chairman , and Dr._C._M._Herzfeld , Program_Chairman . Dr._A._V._Astin , NBS_Director , opened the 5 - day session with introductory remarks , following which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week by NBS scientists , from both the Washington and Boulder_Laboratories . In_addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards , spectroscopy , solid_state physics , interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress , the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics . The programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared , the application of infrared techniques to solid_state studies , and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation .</context>

      <context> The best_known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up_to 50 % by weight of sodium_tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium_tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium_pyrophosphate . In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; and the dwindling built soap_powders as_well_as soap_flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . A well publicized entrant which has achieved <head>success</head> only recently is the built liquid_detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder / active ratio . Hard surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork . The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders . In_addition , many of the hard surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium_orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products .</context>

      <context> In litters of eight mice from similar parents , the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer from 0 to 8 . What probabilities should be attached to these possible outcomes ? When three dice are tossed repeatedly , what is the probability that the number of aces is 0 ( or 1 , or 2 , or 3 ) ? More generally , suppose that an experiment consists_of a number of independent trials , that each trial results in either a `` <head>success</head> '' or a `` non success '' ( `` failure '' ) , and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial . In the examples above , the occurrence of a bull's-eye , a straight haired mouse , or an ace could be called a `` success '' . In_general , any outcome we choose may be labeled `` success '' . The major question in this chapter is : What is the probability of exactly x successes in n trials ?</context>

      <context> The United_States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face . At_the_same_time , we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts . It may seem to some of them that <head>success</head> can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing_up to the intractable tasks at_home . We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene . When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold_war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not_only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development . As a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world community .</context>

      <context> The drive along Massachusetts ' Route_128 , the by-pass which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown Boston , may be a vision of the future . The future could be worse . The plants along Route_128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New_England rocks and trees . They can even be rather grand , like Edward_Land 's monument to the astonishing <head>success</head> of Polaroid . But they deny the values of the city - the crowded , competitive , tolerant city , the `` melting_pot '' which gave_off so many of the most admirable American qualities . They are segregated businesses , combining again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work_force from segregated communities . It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts ' Route_128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements , or from the exploitation of patents which grant at_least a partial monopoly .</context>

      <context> `` There are other Mr._Thynnes . Not everyone is bewitched by Byron 's caliphs and harem beauties '' . Mary 's super critical attitude toward Byron had nothing to_do_with his moral disrepute . She was resentful of his easy <head>success</head> as compared with Shelley 's failure . The same month that Alastor was published , Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The_Siege_of_Corinth , a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley 's generosity rebelled at . The lordly poet was at low-water_mark . The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent .</context>

      <context> He was in his mid_fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once_again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn_off lecturing . There was never a doubt any_more how his structures would be received ; it was always the same unqualified <head>success</head> now . He could no_longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here_and_there he was taken_to_task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no_longer disputable as to its other values . Stowey_Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality . He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rose at half past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn_flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald_Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh_Gazette , then put_on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop .</context>

      <context> She told me . ZING was the creation of two men , Louis_Thor and Bill_Blake , partners in ZING ! , Inc. . They 'd peddled the soap virtually alone , and without much <head>success</head> , until about a year ago , when - with the addition of `` SX-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising_campaign - sales had soared practically into orbit . Their product had been endorsed by Good_Housekeeping , the A._M._A. , and the Veterinary_Journal , among other repositories of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you did n't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friends would think you did n't bathe . My lovely caller - Joyce_Holland was her name - had previously done three filmed commercials for ZING , and this_evening , the fourth , a super production , had been filmed at the home of Louis_Thor . The water in Thor 's big swimming_pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds - fashioned , of_course , from ZING - Joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious `` bath '' while cameras rolled .</context>
