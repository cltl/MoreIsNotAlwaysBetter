      <context> State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called_for yesterday in a report of a `` blue_ribbon '' citizens_committee on the aid to dependent children program . The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New_York_City welfare consulting_firm , listed 10 long_range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case_load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C._Virgil_Martin , <head>president</head> of Carson_Pirie_Scott_+_Co. , committee chairman . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend_upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' .</context>

      <context> Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully - and with some imagination ? In your sales_force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make_out better with a larger number of lower paid salesmen ? Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in_return_for some benefit they can share ? In one company covering the country with a high quality sales_force of 10 men , the <head>president</head> personally phones each major account every 6 mos. . As a result , distribution_costs were cut , customer relations improved . Distribution_costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties - and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job . From the manufacturer 's point_of_view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties .</context>

      <context> I am naive , they say , to make use of such words . I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? - liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as_well_as democratic processes may have to yield before it . This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a <head>President</head> of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme_Court . As for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms . The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one . Why , in_the_first_place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ?</context>

      <context> I will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year . The earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise , sponsored by Life magazine , under the title of the National purpose . The contributors to this testament were all well-known : a former Democratic candidate for <head>President</head> , a New_Deal poet , the magazine 's chief editorial writer , two newspaper_columnists , head of a national broadcasting_company , a popular Protestant evangelist , etc. . What I want to point_out here is that all_of them are ex liberals , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception . I suppose we might classify Billy_Graham as an old liberal . And I would further note that they all - with one exception again - sang in one key or another the same song .</context>

The check had been mailed from Chicago , the envelope bore no return_address , and the check was not signed . `` That 's Johnny '' , sighed the bank <head>president</head> , `` the best hearted boy in the world , but absent-minded '' . But Mercer 's explanation was simple : `` I made_out the check and carried it around a_few days unsigned - in_case I lost it '' .

      <context> For_example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . Let us now put some flesh_on_the_theoretical_bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . One should keep in mind that many_of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas . The <head>president</head> of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive - and the rate_of_attrition due_to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high . It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired - and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed . Roleplaying was offered as a solution - and the procedure worked as_follows : all candidates were invited to a hotel conference_room , where the president explained the difficulty he had , and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work_out .</context>

The batting_average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three . The <head>president</head> of the firm , calculating expenses alone , felt his costs had dropped one-half while success in selection had improved over one_hundred per_cent . The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers . They were , in_a_sense , `` tried_out '' in realistic situations . From the point_of_view of the applicants , less time was wasted in being evaluated - and they got a meal out of it as_well_as some insights into their performances .</context>
