      <context> A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday , but attention quickly turned from Saturday 's victory to next week 's problem : Rice_University . The Mustangs do n't play this week . `` We 're just real happy for the players '' , Coach Bill_Meek said of the 9 - 7 victory over the Air_Force_Academy . `` I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the <head>pressure</head> on . It was the first time we 've been ahead this season ( when John_Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field_goal ) '' .

      <context> If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand . The appointment of U_Thant of Burma as the U.N.'s Acting Secretary_General - at this writing , the choice appears to be certain - offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends . Mongi_Slim of Tunisia and Frederick_Boland of Ireland were early favorites in_the_running , but France did n't like the former and the Soviet_Union would have none of the latter . With the neutralists maintaining <head>pressure</head> for one of their own to succeed Mr._Hammarskjold , U_Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto . What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy . In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers_game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat . He has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future .</context>

Whether the compromises - on both sides - that made_possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen . Mr._Khrushchev 's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ; the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U_Thant represents . In_a_sense , the showdown promised by Mr._Hammarskjold 's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; no precedents have been set as_yet ; structurally , the U.N. is still fluid , vulnerable to the <head>pressures</head> that its new and enlarged membership are bringing_to_bear upon it .

      <context> Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands .

In_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation .

      <context> The threat of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of endangering relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases . For the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry limited price ( but not below average_cost ) . For such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs ( due_to rising wages , etc . ) . Thus , if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this <head>pressure</head> is itself a function of the wage rate .

      <context> We shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation . Obviously , a satisfactory answer to the third question is imperative , if the argument is to get under_way at_all , for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient 's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital lesion , any findings whatsoever in regard_to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of_course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion . The answer the authors give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance . It is as_follows : `` The usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness ( <head>pressure</head> , pain , temperature ) , as_well_as the kinesthetic sensations ( muscular feelings , feelings in the tendons and joints ) , were , as_such , essentially intact , although they seemed , in_comparison_with normal reactions , to be somewhat diminished over the entire body . The supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member , as_well_as the direction and scope of a movement , passively executed ( with one of his members ) , proved to have been , on_the_contrary , very considerably affected '' . The authors insist , however , that these abnormalities in the sense_of_touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight . First_of_all , what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged ?</context>
