      <context> Pelham pointed_out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . A veteran Jackson_County legislator will ask the Georgia_House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . Rep._Mac_Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided_that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in <head>Washington</head> who would_like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday . It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the State_Board_of_Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises .</context>

      <context> Thanks to Spoken_Arts_Records , history buffs may hear Lincoln 's `` most memorable speeches and letters '' in a two disc set , interpreted by Lincoln authority and lecturer Roy_P._Basler . As a contemporary bonus , the set includes Carl_Sandburg 's address at a joint session of Congress , delivered on Lincoln 's birthday two years ago . For those who `` like poetry but never get_around_to reading it '' , the Library_of_Congress makes it possible for poets to be heard reading their own work . The program was instituted in 1940 , and releases are available only from the Recording_Laboratory of the Library_of_Congress , <head>Washington</head> 25 , D._C. A catalogue is available on_request . Newest on the list are John_Ciardi , W._D._Snodgrass , I._A._Richards , Oscar_Williams , Robert_Hillyer , John_Hall_Wheelock , Stephen_Vincent_Benet , Edwin_Muir , John_Peal_Bishop and Maxwell_Bodenheim . Two poets are paired on each record , in the order given above . Decca is not the only large commercial company to impart instruction .</context>

      <context> leaves_of_absences , illnesses , and layoffs . Consider adopting a system of holidays in which time_off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant . It 's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods . For_example , the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for <head>Washington</head> 's birthday . This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups . Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay . This cuts the absentee_rate .</context>

      <context> Dozens of seemingly small matters go_wrong all_over the world . Sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them . I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come_across little things going_wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them . If the Department_of_State is to take primary responsibility for foreign_policy in <head>Washington</head> , it follows that the ambassador is expected to take_charge overseas . This does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion . He is expected to know about what is going_on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed in his country . He is expected to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can .</context>

      <context> It lacks pollen baskets and possesses only a large_number of long , branched hairs on its legs , on which the pollen grains will collect . Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks_like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind . Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali_bees . Nomia_melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United_States west of the Great_Plains , for_example , in Utah and central <head>Washington</head> . In the United_States Department_of_Agriculture 's Yearbook_of_Agriculture , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects , George_E._Bohart mentions a site in Utah which was estimated to contain 200000 nesting females . Often the burrows are only an inch or two apart , and the bee cities cover several acres . The life_history of the alkali_bee is similar to that of Andrena , but the first activity of the adults does not take_place until summer , and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage .</context>
