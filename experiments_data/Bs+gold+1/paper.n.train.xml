O_'_Banion 's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell_Prison for three months for burglary ; two years later he served another three months for assault . Those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery .</context>

      <context> ( This provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality '' . ) But the inner , formal_logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shaping their decision . When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesized '' - into larger planar shapes themselves simply in_order to maintain the integrity of the picture_plane . Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut_away too abruptly into depth ; and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted <head>paper</head> would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump_out of plane . Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to_the_extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) . It was because of this chain-reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_objects , or at_least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there .</context>

      <context> These areas by_virtue_of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued - and set to shuttling again - only by conventional perspective ; that_is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in_order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on <head>paper</head> , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas . It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's , which would confirm the date he assigns it . But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as_well_as of typography ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 .</context>

Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every_other part and plane ; and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface .

      <context> It 's not too_much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will Mr._Average_Citizen . You have your paper horn clutched in your big , craggy fist , and for your entrance you have planned a noisy , colorful and exuberant greeting to your friends and tenants . You find your house a focus of public and police attention .

Maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness . You shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door . You identify yourself and ask him what 's going_on .</context>

      <context> He stared at the report in Killpath 's hand , sure it was written by Accacia - just as sure as if he 'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand . He sucked_in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the gold wire stems of his glasses around his ears and_then , eying the report as it lay before him on the desk , intoned , `` Acting_Lieutenant_Gunnar_Matson one failed to see that the station_keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station 's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide_Detail of the Inspector's_Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying_on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting_Captain_O._T._Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known_as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six '' - he leaned_back and peeled_off his glasses `` - failed to co-operate with the Acting_Captain by returning promptly when so ordered . What have you to say to_that , Sergeant '' ? Killpath sailed the <head>paper</head> across the desk , but Matson did n't pick it up or even glance at it . `` Well '' ? `` I did n't think Accacia knew so many big words , Lieutenant '' .

      <context> The herd was watered and_then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night 's bedground . Two of the new hands , a Mexican named Jose_Amado and a kid known only as Laredo , were picked for the first trick of riding night herd . The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda . They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie 's fire , rolled and lighted brown <head>paper</head> cigarettes , lounged_about . There was some idle_talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day 's drive . But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the boss 's wife and son to join the outfit .</context>

      <context> He turned his attention to the workbench . Perhaps that was the first thing to do . A workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole_thing did n't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned_on it ? Mr._Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of <head>paper</head> and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn_into a workbench . They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . Mr._Crombie poked_at it gingerly with his foot . How could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ?</context>

      <context> Journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips . Not long_ago a newspaper advised those taking_part in a contest that `` snapshots must be of a person not larger than * * f inches '' . Classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions . Readers of the Reader_'s_Digest are familiar_with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips , like the ad in a California <head>paper</head> that advertised `` House for rent . View takes_in five counties , two bedrooms '' . Since brevity is the soul of ambiguity as_well as wit , newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples . `` Officials Meet on Rubbish .</context>
