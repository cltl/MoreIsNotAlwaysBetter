      <context> It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . To do this , it is sufficient to point_out that if the <head>principle</head> in_terms_of which alternatives are to be conceived is such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question . Thus , if what is at_issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either case the judgment in_question is false . Hence , if what is in_question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a_little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded . Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on_the_one_hand , by the two at_least apparently self-consistent but mutually_exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on_the_other_hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann .</context>

      <context> This happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior_Mr._Canada - Henri_de_Courcy . Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments . Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority , Professor_Roland_Claude . And they could n't have entrusted Henri to better hands because `` le_professeur '' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido_mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis_anticus of the leg - and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider <head>principles</head> to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth . That 's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal_Health_Studio which is located at 1821 Mt._Royal_East in Montreal . Undoubtedly you have read the case_histories of some of his prize_winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) . There 's Gaetan_d'Amours who is our newest Mr._Canada ; Jean-Paul_Senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago ; Jack_Boissoneault , who was with us last month ; Charles_Harve , who recently won the `` Most Muscular Man '' subdivision award in the Mr._Canada event ; and a host of others .</context>

      <context> Remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds . The flowers will be huge . Pansies have character . They stick_to their <head>principles</head> , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it . Treat them right and they 'll make a showing every_month in the year except the frigid ones . Give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they 'll repay your solicitude with beauty . A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special .</context>

      <context> In total , these increases in operating_costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such_as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed_Forces . In the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 ) . This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying_out certain transactions involving real_property unless they come into agreement with the Committees_on_Armed_Services of the Senate and the House_of_Representatives . As I have stated previously , the Attorney_General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional <head>principles</head> . Accordingly , if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise . Basic long line communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army , Air_Force , and Federal_Aviation_Agency . The growing communications needs of this new State can best be met , as they have in other States , through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise .</context>

      <context> Whenever artists , indeed , turned_to actual representations or molded three-dimensional_figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . At_the_least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; their <head>principles</head> of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go_too_far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . The storms of the past had died_away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not_yet begun to disturb men 's minds .</context>

      <context> At the rear of the auditorium , upstairs , some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor . It would not give . A Dr._Charles_Taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to hoist him up to the box . In the audience a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob , on the same <head>principle</head> which had led Miss_Harris to demand water . Someone opened the corridor door from the inside , and called_for a doctor . Somehow Dr._Charles_Leale was forced through the mob and squeezed_out into the dingy corridor . He went straight to the Presidential box .</context>

      <context> The policeman walked on , but he looked_back once . That had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred . Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; and they had told their mother about the tumbles . In matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; and so they were consistently true to their <head>principles</head> . `` Never_mind_'' , Arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having pursued the usual unco-operative course of grownups . `` Never_mind . I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' .</context>
