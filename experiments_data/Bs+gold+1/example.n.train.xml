      <context> Another source of NBC pride was its rare film_clip of Bix_Beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew_by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted_out the entire glimpse . Similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz_groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal . `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' may have wound_up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer . By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today 's artists , the program turned_out to be a not quite perfect <head>example</head> of either . Still , the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated . Even Joan_Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan_Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti 's `` Lucia_di_Lammermoor '' Sunday night . The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing_ovation as Miss_Sutherland took curtain_call after curtain_call following a fantastic `` Mad_Scene '' created on_her_own and with the help of the composer and the other performers .</context>

      <context> Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public_press of mid Victorian England . There was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on B.B.C. , where comments were equally made by an Anglican parson , a Free_Church minister and a Catholic priest . Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television_programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen . A notable <head>example</head> of this was the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool , Dr._Heenan , and the Anglican Archbishop of York , Dr._Ramsey , recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury . The good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well_known in England .

Occasionally there are <head>examples</head> of prevision which cannot be pushed_aside without confessing an unscientific attitude . One day Maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in_advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified . Rudyard_Kipling 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ?

      <context> There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud . And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact . Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man . Constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor_unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world_courts , and the veto power in world_councils are but a_few <head>examples</head> . Most_of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it .

Just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding .</context>

      <context> There is evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William_Gilmore_Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such_as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him . Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus_Baldwin_Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy_Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an <head>example</head> followed by many after him . Others who wrote_of low characters and low life included Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , creator of the Big_Bear of Arkansas and Tom_Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson_Jones_Hooper , whose character Simon_Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem_Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried_out his will ; and George_Washington_Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut_Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner 's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a_hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner 's time . Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long established literary precedent .</context>

In much the same way , we recognize the importance of Shakespeare 's familarity with Plutarch and Montaigne , of Shelley 's study of Plato 's dialogues , and of Coleridge 's enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from Plato to Schelling and William_Godwin , through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of English men_of_letters .

      <context> This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons_systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_systems which have been overtaken by events . Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated . For_example , the importance of the Regulus_2 , , a very promising aerodynamic ship to surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic_missile launched by submerged submarines . Another <head>example</head> is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long range interceptor with a speed three_times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid 1960 's .

As an <head>example</head> of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion .

The constancy of p and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in_practice . Obviously , very slight changes in p do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference . ( For_instance , see <head>Example</head> 2 of Section 5 - 5 , on red cards in hands of 5 . ) On_the_other_hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical_phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a baseline for comparative purposes ; that_is , we may discuss the phenomenon in_terms_of its departures from the binomial model .

      <context> Each of the n trials is either a success or a failure . `` Success '' and `` failure '' are just convenient labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk_about binomial trials in_general . These words are more expressive than labels like `` A '' and `` not - A '' . It is natural from the marksman 's viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success , but in the mice <head>example</head> it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse . The word `` binomial '' means `` of two names '' or `` of two terms '' , and both usages apply in our work : the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial , and the second to the terms p and * * f that represent the probabilities of `` success '' and `` failure '' . Sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial , we group these outcomes into two classes , as in the example of the die , where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes `` ace '' and `` not ace '' . We classify mice as `` straight haired '' or `` wavy haired '' , but a hairless mouse appears .</context>

      <context> If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states . However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment . Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the <head>example</head> of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . This probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment_compensation or a Youth_Conservation_Corps . A maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from home .

      <context> Indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society . Government itself was based upon contract ; business_organization - the corporation - was analyzed in contractual terms ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement . It is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in_terms_of contract . In_fact , some - Anzilotti is the principle <head>example</head> - went so far as to say that all international_law could be traced to the single legal norm , Pacta sunt Servanda . The displacement ( at_least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international_law theory and doctrine . In_the_first_place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal_system . One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded_as the law_of_nations .</context>

Though the spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not_yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the Cyclades , which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century . As the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident .

Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times - granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside - are correct ; but all_too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took_place in the early first millennium . The focus of novelty in this world now lay_in the south-eastern districts of the Greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean , always excepting its northern shores , had accepted the Geometric style of pottery . While Protogeometric vases usually turn_up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as_many or more <head>examples</head> of local stamp , these `` non Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century . In their place came local variations within the common style - tentative , as_it_were , in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed . Attica , though important , was not the only teacher of this age . One can take a vase of about 800 B.C. and , without any knowledge of its place_of_origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable .</context>
