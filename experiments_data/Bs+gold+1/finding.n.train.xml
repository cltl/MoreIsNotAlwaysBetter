      <context> It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing_officer 's notes were furnished to the appeal board . Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board . Petitioner knew that the Department 's recommendation was based not on the hearing_officer 's report but on the statement of the local board in his file . Having had every opportunity to rebut the <head>finding</head> of the local board before both the hearing_officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due_process because he did not succeed . It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing_officer 's report and notes at the trial . In_addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes . While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process .</context>

      <context> For_example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related_to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such_as those found in types 1 , and 3 , . One might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse . In_addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog . Anatomically , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our <head>findings</head> in the horse with those of others ( Birnbaum , ' 54 ) in the human_being . The only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard_to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries . As early as 1858 , Le_Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries in human_beings . In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz .</context>

      <context> He paused . `` That 's_about_it . Oh , the time of death . The duration of the digestive process varies , the pathologist says , but the empty stomach and the <head>findings</head> in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that Mrs._Meeker died several hours after her seven o_'_clock dinner . Probably around midnight , give_or_take an hour either way '' . Pauling paused again . `` So there it is '' , he said .</context>
