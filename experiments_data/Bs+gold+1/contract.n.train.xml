      <context> Gov._Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment . Vandiver likely will mention the $ 100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . Meanwhile , it was learned the State_Highway_Department is very near being ready to issue the first $ 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test_suit to test the validity of the act , and_then the sales will begin and <head>contracts</head> let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway_Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural_Roads_Authority bonds for rural road construction work . The department apparently intends to make the Rural_Roads_Authority a revolving_fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid_off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov._Marvin_Griffin .</context>

      <context> If the Orioles are to break their losing_streak within the next two days , it will have to be at_the_expense_of the American_League champion New_York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night_game and a single test Sunday afternoon . The flavor of Baltimore 's Florida_Grapefruit_League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron_Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army 's military training_program and is ready for belated spring_training . Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove_in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average , completes the Birds ' spring squad at 49 players . The big , 22 - year old shortstop , the 1960 American_league `` rookie of the year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his <head>contract</head> for an estimated $ 15000 and was a spectator at tonight 's 5 - to 3 loss to Kansas_City - the winless Birds ' sixth setback in_a_row . The 6 - foot 3 inch Hansen checked_in close_to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting_weight last spring . He hopes to melt_off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks_camp three weeks hence . When he was inducted into the Army at Fort_Knox_, Ky. , Hansen 's weight had dropped to 180 - `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said .</context>

      <context> SBA serves also as a clearing_house for information on products and processes particularly adaptable for exploitation by small firms . This may be helpful in improving the competitive position of established firms through diversification and expansion or through more economical utilization of plant capacity . Production specialists are_available in SBA regional offices to help individual small business_concerns with technical production problems . These problems frequently arise where a firm is making items for the Government not directly along the lines of its normal civilian business or where the Government specifications require operations that the firm did not understand when it undertook the <head>contract</head> . Production assistance often takes the form of locating tools or materials which are urgently needed . Advice is given also on problems of plant location and plant space . The property sales assistance program is designed to assist small business_concerns that may wish to buy property offered for sale by the Federal_Government .</context>
