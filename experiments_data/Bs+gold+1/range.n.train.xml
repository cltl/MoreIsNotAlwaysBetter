      <context> Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines . If so , it might be worth_while to assign a future jazz show to a different department - one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut_down on the number of performers and give them a_little room to display their talents . As_a_matter_of_fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results . A_few years ago a `` Timex All Star Jazz Show '' offered a broad <head>range</head> of styles , ranging from Lionel_Hampton 's big_band to the free-wheeling Dukes_of_Dixieland . An enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live '' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance . About that same time John_Crosby 's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing_space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do . In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods .</context>

      <context> One of the script 's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today . NBC had gathered a_lot of historical material which it was eager to share . For_example , there was sheet_music with the word `` jazz '' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took_hold . Samples zoomed into closeup <head>range</head> in regular succession , like telephone_poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 's . However well_chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening 's main business , which ( considering the talent at_hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style . Another source of NBC pride was its rare film_clip of Bix_Beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew_by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted_out the entire glimpse . Similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz_groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal .</context>

      <context> This difference is made_up of many factors . Some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings .

Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests . Yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records .

      <context> Richards ' view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety : for him it constitutes , in part , the organization of impulses . A sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have_to take_account of all_of these . But there is one in_particular which , it seems to me , deserves special attention . In the wide <head>range</head> of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate . The study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way . William_Wimsatt and Cleanth_Brooks , it seems to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in_which this control is effected : `` For if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation ) - then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affections at_all . Something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like '' expressions `` of these emotions , without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement '' .</context>

      <context> The intra nasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organisms . The importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated . The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory_tract , such_as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi , are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence . Very small particles , however , in a size <head>range</head> of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar_bed of the lungs . This area is highly susceptible to infection . The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intra tissue inoculation . The relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in Table 1 .</context>

      <context> These dosages could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case . The behavior of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field_trial conducted with a non pathogenic organism . An aqueous suspension of the spores of B. subtilis , var. niger , generally known as Bacillus_globigii , was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles . A satisfactory cloud was produced even_though these nozzles were only about 5 per_cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size <head>range</head> of 1 to 5 microns . In this test , 130 gallons of a suspension , having a count of * * f organisms per ml , or a total of approximately * * f spores , was aerosolized .

      <context> A Colombian female 's brood of sixteen boa_constrictors born in the Staten_Island_Zoo averaged 20 inches . This birth length seems to be typical .

The <head>range</head> is from 14 to 25 inches ; the former figure is based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a Central_American female ( see chapter on Laying , Brooding , Hatching , and Birth ) , the latter on a `` normal '' newly born individual . However , as so many of the records are not certainly based on newborn snakes , these data must be taken tentatively ; final conclusions will have_to await the measurements of broods from definite localities .

      <context> Data on the former are scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length . For four of the six ( the anaconda and the amethystine_python cannot be included for lack of data ) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa_constrictor being the smallest and the Indian_python the next in size at the former stage . Let us speculate a_little on the maximum size of the anaconda . If , in a certain part of the <head>range</head> , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet . When it comes_to rate of early growth , the Indian_python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per_year for the first two years , more_or_less . The African rock_python , a close second , is followed in_turn by the reticulate python . There are few data on the boa_constrictor , those for the anaconda are unconvincing , and there is nothing at_all on the amethystine_python .</context>

      <context> Furthermore , a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety . Although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present , different autonomic somatic patterns underlie aggression and anxiety , respectively , as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines , the state of the muscle_tone , and the Mecholyl_test . The psychological incompatibility of these emotional_states seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference . In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological <head>range</head> , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems , respectively . We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic somatic downward discharge as_well_as regarding the hypothalamic cortical discharge . Although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first approximation , it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic cortical discharges account_for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances , in experimental and clinical neurosis , and as the result of psychopharmacological agents . In_view_of the important role which emotional_disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes .</context>

      <context> This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value_orientation elsewhere ; for_example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism . In America also all_of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common religion . Even the non church_members - the freewheelers , marginal religionists and_so_on - have the values of Christian civilization internalized in them . Furthermore , religion tends to integrate the whole <head>range</head> of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values ; for_example , those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends . Finally , it gives sanctity , more than human legitimacy , and even , through super empirical reference , transcendent and supernatural importance to some values ; for_example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the state as a divine instrument . It places certain values at_least beyond questioning and tampering . Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends .</context>
