      <context> State_Party_Chairman_James_W._Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking_up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen._John_Tower will be the featured speaker . In the Blue_Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting_precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according_to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the <head>race</head> , it voted no - and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system - a system which the party opposes in its platform . Sam_Caldwell , State_Highway_Department public_relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd 's campaign .</context>

      <context> The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test_suit to test the validity of the act , and_then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway_Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural_Roads_Authority bonds for rural road construction work . The department apparently intends to make the Rural_Roads_Authority a revolving_fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid_off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his <head>race</head> for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov._Marvin_Griffin . The Highway_Department source told The_Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds . Schley_County_Rep._B._D._Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body 's action of Friday in voting itself a $ 10 per day increase in expense allowances . Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought .</context>

Toying_with her field in the early stages , Garden_Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip_Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3 - 5 for the 7 furlongs . Richard_M._Forbes 's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in_front of Glen_T._Hallowell 's Milties_Miss . A bright sun and brisk wind had the track in a fast condition for_the_first_time this week and 8280 St._Patty_Day celebrants bet $ 842617 on the well prepared program .</context>

      <context> Since 1949 , the St._Louis club has been below .500 on May 1 just four times . The '49 team was off to a so-so 5 - 5 beginning , then fell as low as 12 - 17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories . The '52 Cards were 6 - 7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club 's top since 1949 . Then last season the_Birds tumbled as low as 11 - 18 on May 19 before recovering to make a <head>race</head> of it and total 86 victories . Since 1949 , the only National_League club that got_off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team . Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 . The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New_York 's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 .</context>

      <context> The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries . There is much truth in both these charges , and not many Bourbons deny them . Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites . Most_of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best <head>race</head> in the world and that it should remain pure . Many Northerners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly . The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives . But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this .</context>

      <context> Occasionally , you may come_across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning_over sods in your garden , but you have_to be a really keen observer to see them at_all . They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in_spite_of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . I must add at_once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . It is on them alone that the future of their <head>race</head> depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold_weather . Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50 ` F and there is not too_much wind . Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a_couple_of those wonderful flowering currants such_as the red Ribes_sanguineum of our Pacific_Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy_willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins .</context>

      <context> Such was the impromptu that Voltaire gave to howls of laughter at Sans_Souci and that was soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of Europe , to be printed sometime later , but with the name of Timon_of_Athens , the famous misanthrope , substituted for that of Rousseau . How cruel ! But at_the_same_time how understandable . How could the rich , for whom life was made so simple , ever understand the subterfuges , the lies , the frauds , the errors , sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the <head>race</head> of life ? How , for_example , could a Voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a Rousseau would find himself when , soon after the furor of his first Discourse , he acquired still another title to fame ? This time as a musician . As a composer .</context>
