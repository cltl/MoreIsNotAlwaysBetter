      <context> In their book American_Skyline , Christopher_Tunnard and Henry_Hope_Reed argue that Franklin_Roosevelt 's New_Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility - a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote . The first superhighways - New_York 's Henry_Hudson and Chicago 's Lake_Shore , San_Francisco 's Bay_Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania_Turnpike - were built as part of the federal works_program which was going_to cure the depression . At_the_same_time , Roosevelt 's Federal_Housing_Administration , coupled with Henry_Morgenthau 's cheap-money policy , permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes . Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U._S. government ; householders who had been unable to pick_up the burden of short-term high interest <head>mortgages</head> found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per_cent , under government aegis .</context>

When it was proposed to rebuild the church , Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high . He was sure that he could do better if he went_to Atlanta to get the deal financed . But when this proposal was made to his Deacon_Board , he met unanimous opposition .</context>
