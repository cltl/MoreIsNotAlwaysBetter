      <context> These are mentalities which crave action - and they are beginning to get_it , as Messrs._Salsich and Engh report on page 372 . Even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately ? ) left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading . Friends , a <head>picture</head> magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary_organization of employees of the Gulf_Telephone_Company at Foley , Alabama . `` If the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf_Coast '' , the account reads , `` they can count_on heavy opposition from a group of commando trained telephone employees - all girls . Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast moving Civil_Defense outfit , 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move_into action at a minute 's notice '' . According_to Friends , the unit was organized by John_Snook , a former World_War_/2 , commando who is vice_president and general_manager of the telephone_company .</context>

      <context> Now again in 1961 , in England , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity . The Church_Unity_Octave , January 18 - 25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches . Many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 . But it must be readily seen that the religious <head>picture</head> in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at_least on the Catholic side . For `` the_tide_is_well_on_the_turn '' , as the London_Catholic_weekly_Universe has written . I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal_Newman . As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated country .</context>

      <context> I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal_Newman . As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated country . Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England . In representing part of this new <head>picture</head> , I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments ; but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican_Churches and about the present religious state of England . Since the Protestant clergy for_the_most_part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my Roman_collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman_Catholic cleric . In_any_case , I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen , even in Devonshire and Cornwall , where anti Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest . Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism .</context>

      <context> Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities . I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town . I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in_detail , from the hodge-podge of news <head>pictures</head> I have seen . And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious_mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence . The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ?</context>

      <context> What happened to the fourteen missing men ? These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of_all_time . For hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted_of ( 1 ) the captain 's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man 's desk on_board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports . All_told , they offered a highly confused <head>picture</head> . But since 1927 , researchers digging_into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information . Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage .

      <context> Not discussed here are some military problems of modern_times such_as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision_making are not the bottlenecks . Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain_forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach . This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for_example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry . We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all <head>picture</head> and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes . This problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis . Since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it . First , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist .</context>

      <context> In free_burning electric arcs , for_instance , approximately 90 % of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving_rise to local heat fluxes in excess of **f as measured by the authors - the exact value depending_on the arc atmosphere . In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high_temperature research tools often more than 50 % of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode . The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical_phenomena occurring in free_burning arcs . In plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the <head>picture</head> somewhat . The heat transfer to the anode is_due to the following effects : 1 . Heat_of_condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic_energy of the electrons impinging_on the anode . This energy transfer depends_on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode sheath .</context>

      <context> Bernard_Heuvelmans also treats of the largest snakes , but on the third level , and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda . He reasons that as anacondas 30 feet long are often found , some might be 38 , and occasional `` monstrous freaks '' over 50 . He rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more . His thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength , but these seem to be given to complete his <head>picture</head> , not to be believed . Detailed information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows . Discussions of the giants one_by_one will include , as_far_as_possible , data on these aspects of growth : size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; time required to reach maturity ; rate_of_growth both before and after this crucial stage ; and maximum length , with confirmation or amplification of Oliver 's figures .</context>

      <context> The dictionary is a form dictionary , at_least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary_entries . Also , the dictionary is divided into at_least two parts : the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms . A more detailed description of dictionary operations - text lookup and dictionary modification - give a clearer <head>picture</head> . Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists_of three steps . The first is compiling a list of text forms , assigning an information cell to each , and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence . For this step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the W_region are used for storage of the forms in the text form list ; cells in the X-region and Y_region are reserved as information cells for text forms .</context>

      <context> If the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar_volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put_in the bank . In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated . No suburban shopping-center branch - not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store . Telephone_orders distort the <head>picture</head> : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather_than a central city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminates city sales_tax . The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened . Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are .</context>

      <context> And it is thought by many who think_about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet , progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso , and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De_Kooning . Quasimodo defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' . `` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to Franz_Kline and myself , `` the nothing that_is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non time '' . It is his relentlessness and unwavering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such <head>pictures</head> as `` The_Invasion_of_Cuba '' . In this work , his use of non color is startling and skillful . The sweep of space , the delicate counterbalance of the white masses , the over-all completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece . I asked Quasimodo recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and_then had her breathe on the canvas '' , which was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity .</context>
