      <context> Indications as_late_as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory drought as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage . Over the first five frames , Jack_Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in_the_middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American_League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick_Hyde , submarine_ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock . A two run homer by Norm_Siebern and a solo_blast by Bill_Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight <head>starts</head> . With one down in the eighth , Marv_Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . Catcher Frank_House 's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . Then Heywood_Sullivan , Kansas_City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run .</context>

      <context> Richard_M._Forbes 's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in_front of Glen_T._Hallowell 's Milties_Miss . A bright sun and brisk wind had the track in a fast condition for_the_first_time this week and 8280 St._Patty_Day celebrants bet $ 842617 on the well prepared program . Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James_P._Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . Garden_Fresh , the result of a mating of Better_Self and Rosy_Fingered , seems to improve with each <head>start</head> and appeared to win the St._Patrick's_Day_Purse with some speed in reserve . She was moving_up to the allowance department after winning a $ 10000 claiming event . George_Kerr , the swift striding Jamaican , set a meet record in the 600 - yard run in the Knights_of_Columbus track_meet tonight , beating Purdue 's Dave_Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . Kerr , who set the world_record earlier this month in New_York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped_out Mills 's early pace and beat the young Big_10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards .</context>

      <context> End Gene_Raesz , who broke a hand in the Owl 's game with LSU , was back working_out with Rice_Monday , and John_Nichols , sophomore guard , moved_back into action after a week 's idleness with an ankle injury . The Texas_Aggies got a day_off Monday - a special gift from Coach Jim_Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night , but Myers announced that halfback George_Hargett , shaken_up in the Tech game , would not play against Trinity Saturday . Halfback Bud_Priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly mending sprained ankle , joined TCU 's workout Monday . The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American_Football_League <head>starts</head> - a 19 - 12 triumph over the Denver_Broncos - but their visit will be a short one . The Texans have two more road_games - at Buffalo and Houston - before they play for the home_folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank_Stram 's men will meet the Bills just_as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings . Buffalo coach Buster_Ramsey , who has become one of the game 's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex National_Football_Leaguers , M._C._Reynolds and Warren_Rabb . Rabb , the former Louisiana_State field_general , came_off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22 - 12 upset victory over the Houston_Oilers , defending league champions .</context>

      <context> The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick_Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park . It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . THE DENVER-AREA TV_audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home_runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob_Howsam that the games are not to be blacked_out when his Bears are playing at_home . This rule providing_for a blackout of televised baseball 30_minutes before the <head>start</head> of a major or minor_league game in any area comes from the game 's top rulers . The last couple of years the Bears management got_the_business from the `` Living_Room_Athletic_Club '' when games were cut_off . Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy . This year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide_by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here .</context>

      <context> Solly_Hemus announced a switch in his starting_pitcher , from Bob_Gibson to Ernie_Broglio , for several reasons : 1 . Broglio 's 4 - 0 won-lost_record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; 2 . The desire to give Broglio as many <head>starts</head> as possible ; 3 . The Redbirds ' disheartening 11 - 7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday . Manager_Hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment . After Thursday 's open date , Solly plans to open with Larry_Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night .</context>

      <context> Despite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky_Burgess .455 , Gino_Cimoli .389 , Bill_Virdon .340 , Bob_Clemente and Dick_Groat , each .323 , Dick_Stuart .306 , Don_Hoak .280 and Bob_Skinner .267 . Bill_Mazeroski with .179 and Hal_Smith with .143 were the only Pirates dragging_their_feet . Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit_out most of the series is Bob_Friend , who was beaten by The_Man twice last season on dramatic home_runs . Friend is off to a great <head>start</head> with a 4 - 0 record but is n't likely to see action here this week . `` We 're getting Friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good '' , Murtaugh said . `` Virdon has been blasting the ball . No plunkers for him '' .</context>

The '52 Cards were 6 - 7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club 's top since 1949 . Then last season the_Birds tumbled as low as 11 - 18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories .

Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 .

There was a brief interruption while one of O_'_Banion 's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip . Then O_'_Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds . This dinner was the <head>start</head> of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more_or_less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek_by_jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928_-_29 '' . However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever . O_'_Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal .</context>
