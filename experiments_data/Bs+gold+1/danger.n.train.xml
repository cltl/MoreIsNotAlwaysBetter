      <context> The architects do not believe that the education of the interior_designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round_tables , workshops or panel_discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled_down crux_of_the_matter is education . It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . The element of public <head>danger</head> which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior_designer 's training . We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior_design student as not having serious bearing on the subject . The real question that follows is - how are those four years used and what is their value as training ?</context>

      <context> Accordingly Selkirk 's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by October , John_Halkett had torn_down both posts , floating the timber to `` the Forks '' in rafts . `` I have done everything '' , he wrote , `` to break_up the whole of that unfortunate establishment '' . Despite Company threats , duly carried_through , to cut_off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing_nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village . They would attempt to bring supplies from St._Louis or Prairie_du_Chien at `` great expense as well as <head>danger</head> '' . At Fort_Garry some of the_Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United_States , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort_Snelling . The disasters of 1825 - 1826 caused more to leave . After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick .</context>

      <context> This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast_Survey stations in the Pacific which are equipped with seismographs . Its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami . By means of charts showing wave travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time_of_arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under_way at any spot in the Pacific . The civil and military authorities are then advised of the <head>danger</head> , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps . All_of these activities are geared to a top priority communication_system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly . Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence . On November 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka_Peninsula .</context>

      <context> It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter_solstice . This and other fears of the solar_system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic_system and its built-in concept of periodicity and_then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions . This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls . In_fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no <head>dangers</head> . There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision . A meteor could fall on San_Francisco . Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .</context>

      <context> He is , like Phillip_Marlowe , too alienated to be reliable . Finally , in The Maltese_Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam_Spade becomes the chief murder_suspect . In_order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl_friend . What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock_Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private_eye is in <head>danger</head> of turning_into his opposite . It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery_story which creates this fatal dilemma . By upholding his own personal code_of_behavior , the private_detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption . That society responds by condemning the private_eye as a threat to the status_quo , a potential criminal .</context>

      <context> She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man . Women themselves have come to look_upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld . She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done . One who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the <head>danger</head> .

He has_to cope_with frustration and other emotional_disturbance and anomie .

      <context> The sheriff and District_Attorney_Mills hastily swore_out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed , according_to signed statements by Chavez and Dr._I._P._George , and ordered Deputy_Barney_Clark of Raton to rescue the posseman . Traveling all night , Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock May 22 . Occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a number of horsemen were sighted on the hills , disappearing at the posse 's approach . A Mexican justice_of_the_peace had issue a writ against Chavez for taking_part in the `` murder '' of Manuel_Gonzales so he and his father were anxious to be taken_out of <head>danger</head> . The men helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to Raton along with three other families desiring to leave . The ten or more dangerous parties singled_out for prosecution were still at_large , and Pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe_houses , defending themselves through loopholes , it would be most difficult to capture them .

      <context> Scotty did not go_back to school . His parents talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the University_Hospital - Mr._McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family - and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off , spend a_lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty_much as he chose - provided , of_course , he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating . His teacher and his school_principal were conferred_with and everyone agreed that , if he kept_up with a certain amount of work at home , there was little <head>danger</head> of his losing a term . Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments . He was discharged from the hospital after a two day checkup and he and his parents had what Mr._McKinley described as a `` celebration lunch '' at the cafeteria on the campus .
