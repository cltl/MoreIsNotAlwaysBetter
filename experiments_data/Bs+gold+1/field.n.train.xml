      <context> On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought_out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make_up this nation . On the other we have the flag_wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways . After_all , the <head>field</head> is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates . In_addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever expanding and changing society .

      <context> The outlook for the amateur , for_instance , is usually dependent_on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque . His love of folklore has romanticism in it , and he does n't care much about the dollar_sign or the footnote . Folklore is his hobby , and he , all_too rightly , wishes it to remain as such . The amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more_than the amateur who has taken_to the <head>field</head> . The collector enjoys the contact with rural life ; he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream '' reasons that many persons hunt game ; and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located . Fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them do n't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material . But there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts - one dominated_by money , the other by nineteenth century German scholarship .</context>

In the <head>field</head> of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large_numbers from the simple-minded , one minute shows . In response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion_picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day . Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at_heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short_story . Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .</context>

      <context> If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . First , T may not have a single characteristic value ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar_field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed . Second , even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely over F into a product of polynomials of degree 1 , there may not be enough characteristic vectors for T to span the space V ; this is clearly a deficiency in T . The second situation is illustrated by the operator T on * * f ( F any <head>field</head> ) represented in the standard basis by * * f . The characteristic polynomial for A is * * f and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for A ( or for T ) . Thus T is not diagonalizable . One sees that this happens because the null_space of * * f has dimension 1 only .</context>
