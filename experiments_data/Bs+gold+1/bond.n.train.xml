      <context> Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen._Parkhouse . The bill would increase from $ 5000000 to $ 15000000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water_project . Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas . Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water_program by local <head>bonds</head> , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten 's attack . The bill 's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J._W._Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio_(_Kika_)_de_la_Garza of Mission , Sam_F._Collins of Newton and Joe_Chapman of Sulphur_Springs . `` This is a poor boy 's bill '' , said Chapman . `` Dallas and Fort_Worth can vote bonds .</context>

      <context> One , by Sen._Louis_Crump of San_Saba , would aid more than 17000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise_taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized . Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $ 1000 fine . It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas_Research_League .

      <context> O_'_Banion 's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell_Prison for three months for burglary ; two years later he served another three months for assault . Those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery . But by now O_'_Banion 's political pull was beginning to be effective . On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $ 10000 <head>bond</head> was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle_prossed . On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come_upon by a Detective_Sergeant_John_J._Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the Postal_Telegraph_Building ; the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $ 30000 in bribes , it was estimated . As promptly as Torrio , O_'_Banion jumped into bootlegging . He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the Sicilians , but he had his huge North_Side portion to exploit and he made a great_deal of money .</context>

      <context> For him Mercer produced the lyric to `` Out_of_Breath_Scared_to_Death_of_You '' , introduced in that most successful of all the Gaieties , by Sterling_Holloway . This 1930 edition also had songs in it by Vernon_Duke and Ira_Gershwin , by E._Y._Harburg and Duke , and by Harry_Myers . Entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged the burgeoning song_writer to take a wife , Elizabeth_Meehan , a dancer in the Gaieties . The Mercers took_up residence in Brooklyn , and Mercer found a regular job in Wall_Street `` misplacing stocks and <head>bonds</head> '' . When he heard that Paul_Whiteman was looking_for singers to replace the Rhythm_Boys , Mercer applied and got the job , `` not for my voice , I 'm sure , but because I could write songs and material generally '' . While with the Whiteman band Mercer met Jerry_Arlen . He had yet to meet Harold_Arlen , for although they had `` collaborated '' on `` Satan 's Li ' l Lamb '' , Mercer and Harburg had worked from a lead_sheet the composer had furnished them .</context>

      <context> It appears possible to set a lower_limit of about * * f for the activation_energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon_tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form * * f radical . The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions . Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon_tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data . It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical_reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation_energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free_radicals , as_well_as information on the heat_of_dissociation of the carbon halogen <head>bond</head> . The reaction of chlorine with carbon_tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies . It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid . It should be possible to free carbon_tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine .</context>

      <context> The layout of the sewer_lines was designed by Henry_W._Taylor , who was the engineer for the Manchester_Village disposal_plant . No figures were submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town . The 1958 town_meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facilities . The final step was a vote for a $ 230000 <head>bond</head> issue for the construction of a sewage_system by the 1959 town_meeting , later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special town_meeting June_21 , 1960 . There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams . Manchester 's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev._J._D._Wickham , headmaster of Burr and Burton_Seminary , was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , Samuel_F._B._Morse . At_any_rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington .</context>
