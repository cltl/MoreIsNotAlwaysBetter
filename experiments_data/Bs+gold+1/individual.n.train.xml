Representing as_it_did the efforts of only unauthorized <head>individuals</head> of the Roman and Anglican_Churches , and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in_fact , was condemned by the Holy_Office in 1864 .

The Church_Unity_Octave , January 18 - 25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches . Many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 .</context>

      <context> Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states . Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart <head>individuals</head> and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the nations .</context>

      <context> There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting <head>individuals</head> and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . ) In a mobile society , congregational health depends_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like elements will have_to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .</context>

      <context> I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand_out quite clearly .

They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not_only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the <head>individual</head> or group . Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized . Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act . To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .</context>

Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to <head>individuals</head> ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services . Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry_out the provisions of the Act .</context>

The significant things in it , at the higher religious levels , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of self-preservation , self pacification , and self completion .

      <context> The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit . The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem . Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced . The <head>individual</head> with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination . But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple . As shown earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple elements .

      <context> The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality . It lost sight of the <head>individual</head> almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action . To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy . First , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity .</context>
