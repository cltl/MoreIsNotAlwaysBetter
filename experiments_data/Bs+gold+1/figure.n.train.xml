      <context> `` It is possible that I over corrected '' , he said ruefully . Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes . So he wound_up with a dozen . `` It was a nice round <head>figure</head> , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too_much perturbed . From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben_Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas_open . The idol of the hackers , of_course , is Ray_Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United_States_Open . Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie_Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock strewn gully .</context>

      <context> Almost every official who reflects on_it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets . You read various guesses on how many Americans are camping . The number depends_on who is talking at the moment . The <head>figures</head> range as high as 15 million families . I 've heard 10 million mentioned often , but I 'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping . Seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more . Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable .</context>

      <context> Authorities believe that many_of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business . Look_at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland . Sarah_Gross , a dress_shop proprietor , paid $ 1020 to a masseur , and Mr._A. , a laborer , paid $ 4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines - the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' . Multiply these <head>figures</head> by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually . You will come_up with a frightening total . That 's why the FDA , the American_Medical_Association ( AMA ) , and the National_Better_Business_Bureau ( BBB ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $ 610 million or_so paid to medical charlatans annually . The Postmaster_General recently reported that mail_order frauds - among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently - are at the highest level in history .</context>

      <context> A band viscometer is shown in <head>Figure</head> 2 . It consists_of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . A tape of cellulose_acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks .</context>

      <context> At_the_same_time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping_at the stalls , storing up fresh impressions of what they looked_like , how they moved . In_particular he sought the gentle , sweet-faced nuns , with head_coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads , remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper . Discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a study of the anatomy of folds . He improvised as he went_along , completing a life-size clay <head>figure</head> , then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber , to the consistency of thick mud . No fold could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the Madonna 's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive support to Christ 's body , to intensify her inner turmoil . When the cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made . `` So that 's sculpture '' , commented Argiento wryly , when he had sluiced down the floor for a week , `` making mud pies '' .</context>

      <context> For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile . She would have said triumph . Then Angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen . Jessica_Packard lifted her head and followed the retreating <head>figure</head> , her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips . For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; then she snorted and groped_for her fork . There 's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green_beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling_away of a family . Procreation , expansion , proliferation - these are the laws of living_things , with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments : oblivion .</context>

      <context> date of laying , length of incubation_period , number of chicks reaching the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of rooster 's wattles and_so_on , all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese than English , the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen . Below these particulars was a series of alpha beta gammas connected by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed . Alex 's instruction was rapid , for the doctor had_to go_off to the Rue_Ecole_de_Medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all . But after the doctor 's return that night Alex could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar <head>figure</head> crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels , apparently giving its egg hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen . A knocking at Alex 's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning . It was the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in_haste . The doctor stood about , waiting for Alex to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the still dark hallways , past the bedroom of the patronne , and so into the street .</context>

      <context> He had only a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short . It was almost as white as his teeth . For a man of his mass he was curiously short . He was n't a dwarf but he was a_bit of a comic <head>figure</head> . A man with so big and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms is expected to stand taller than five feet five . For Felix it was a_bit of a stretch to make even that measurement . The man was just this side of being a freak .</context>

      <context> Fing , a lean , chiseled , impeccable gentleman of the old_school who was once mistaken on the street for Sir_Cedric_Hardwicke , is responsible_for the rediscovery of Verdi 's earliest , most raucous opera , Nabisco , a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent_of the Mudugno version of `` Volare '' . Miss_Pulova has a voice that Maria_Callas once described as `` like chipping teeth with a screw_driver '' , and her round , opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the emotions demanded by the role of Rosalie . The Champs_Elysees is literally littered this summer with the prostrate bodies of France 's beat-up beatnik jeunes_filles . Cause of all this commotion : squat , pug-nosed , balding , hopelessly ugly Jean-Pierre_Bravado , a Bogartian <head>figure</head> , who plays a sadistic , amoral , philosophic Tasti-Freeze salesman in old New-Waver Fredrico_de_Mille_Rossilini 's endlessly provocative film , A_Sour_Sponge . Bravado has been alternately described as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of France and myself '' ( De_Gaulle ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob '' ! ( Norman_Mailer ) , but no one can deny that the screen crackles with electricity whenever he is on it . Soaring to stardom along with him , Margo_Felicity_Brighetti , a luscious and curvaceously beguiling Italian starlet , turns_in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic .</context>
