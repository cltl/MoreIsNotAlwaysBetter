      <context> Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according_to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county <head>unit</head> system - a system which the party opposes in its platform . Sam_Caldwell , State_Highway_Department public_relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd 's campaign . Caldwell 's resignation had been expected for some time . He will be succeeded by Rob_Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years .</context>

      <context> Carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that RA berth , and he wanted to play it cool . So Mel_Chandler set_out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before . When the Korean_war began , on June 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day Custer had gone_down fighting at the Little_Big_Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World_War_2 , , the 7_th_Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition . Its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another <head>unit</head> , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World_War_2 , . Just a month after the Korean_War broke_out , the 7_th_Cavalry was moving_into the lines , ready for combat . From then on the Fighting_Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in Korea . One night on the Naktong_River , Mel_Chandler called_on that fabled esprit_de_corps .</context>

      <context> Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk_officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces . The next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding_officer of Troop_H , 7_th_Cavalry , in_the_middle of corps maneuvers in Japan . Outside of combat , he could n't have landed in a tougher spot . First_of_all , no <head>unit</head> likes to have a new CO brought_in from the outside , especially when he 's an armchair trooper . Second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull_the_rug_out_from_under him , it 's on maneuvers . In combat , helping your CO make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed . But in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all_the_time , it 's easy .</context>

      <context> One wonders about its applicability to people . Will advances in human sciences help us build social_structures and governments which will enable us to cope_with people as_effectively_as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic_acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? The answer is of_course yes . For the family is the simplest example of just such a <head>unit</head> , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people . Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes . But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides . We have ample light when the sun sets ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; the range of our voice ignores distance .</context>

      <context> Also , the program for fleet modernization will be stepped_up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures . Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year . Other factors increasing operating_costs include the higher unit_cost of each flying hour , up 11 % in two years , and of each steaming hour , up 15 % . In total , these increases in operating_costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such_as reduced numbers of <head>units</head> and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed_Forces . In the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 ) . This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying_out certain transactions involving real_property unless they come into agreement with the Committees_on_Armed_Services of the Senate and the House_of_Representatives . As I have stated previously , the Attorney_General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles .</context>

      <context> If the volume is the molal volume , then * * f is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists . Although the * * f calculation is obvious by_analogy_with that for gravitational_field and osmotic_pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects . Consider a shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of h ( referred to the same base as H ) and a cross-sectional area of a . If * * f is the change per <head>unit</head> volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and |r is the density of the fluid , then the total potential_energy of the system above the reference height is * * f . * * f is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h . The total volume of the system above the reference height is * * f , and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential_energy of the system in_terms_of H . The minimum total potential_energy is found by taking the derivative with_respect_to H and equating to zero .</context>

      <context> Thus the first lines of one of Charles_Wesley 's hymns are as_follows . `` A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify '' . In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . Dominant stress is of_course more than extended duration , and normally centers_on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer <head>units</head> they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center_on its first syllable rather than its last . But the parallel is significant . When the answer to what 's wrong now ? is Bill 's broken a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair .</context>

      <context> Other examples follow . `` I 'll come by Tuesday . I can n't be happy long without drinking water '' . In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent_to on Tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken_language ; but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a prepositional <head>unit</head> used as an adjunct , by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at_most . In the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking_water is equivalent_to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water . But the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for_example , can undermine distinctions such_as these . And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by_any_means .</context>

Syllables are genuine <head>units</head> , but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties . Sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear . Doubt on this point is strongest before / l / and / / or / r / . From the point_of_view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables .</context>

      <context> Still , even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect . A third explanation is suggested by Richardson 's analysis of Sukuma tone . There we see a basically simple phonemic_system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic_system . While the phonemes can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in_some_way to morphemic <head>units</head> , i._e. until the morphophonemics is worked_out , or at_least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success . In the `` typical tone_language '' , tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics . The phonemic_systems which must support these morphophonemic_systems , however , are very different . The inventory of tones is much smaller , and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension , pitch level .</context>

      <context> This can only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are insufficiently general . If , as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems . One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems . Since tone_systems typically comprise fewer <head>units</head> than either consonant or vowel_systems , we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis . Actual practice does not often work_out this way . Tone_systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal_systems . Welmers has suggested one explanation .</context>
