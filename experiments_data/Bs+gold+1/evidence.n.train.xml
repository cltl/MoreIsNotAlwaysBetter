      <context> The Fulton_County_Grand_Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary_election produced `` no <head>evidence</head> '' that any irregularities took_place . The jury further said in term end presentments that the City_Executive_Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City_of_Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . The September October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior_Court_Judge_Durwood_Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate_Ivan_Allen_Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of_this city '' .</context>

      <context> For several days , she was ill as a result of Lee 's treatment . Mrs._Shaefer never got_around_to joining the thousand or_so people who paid Lee some $ 30000 for his ozone machines . For Mrs._Shaefer - who had been given a clean bill_of_health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee - and her friend were agents for the California_Pure_Food and Drug_Inspection_Bureau . And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the <head>evidence</head> of Lee 's quack shenanigans , gathered by the tape_recorder under her friend 's clothing , proved adequate in court for convicting Franklin_D._Lee . The charge : violation of the California Medical_Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs . The sentence : 360 days ' confinement in the county jail .

      <context> The Final_Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others . Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once_and_for_all by showing how representative types of `` mere '' anti-Semites were drawn step_by_step into the program of skull bashings and gassings ? The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' . But if there was <head>evidence</head> at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann 's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it . Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states . Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors .</context>

      <context> Those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery . But by now O_'_Banion 's political pull was beginning to be effective . On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $ 10000 bond was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle_prossed . On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come_upon by a Detective_Sergeant_John_J._Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the Postal_Telegraph_Building ; the jury wanted better <head>evidence</head> than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $ 30000 in bribes , it was estimated . As promptly as Torrio , O_'_Banion jumped into bootlegging . He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the Sicilians , but he had his huge North_Side portion to exploit and he made a great_deal of money . Unlike the Sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution .</context>

      <context> But there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult . At his trial , petitioner sought to secure through subpoena_duces_tecum the longhand notes of the Department 's hearing_officer , Evensen , as_well as his report thereon .

He alleged no specific procedural errors or <head>evidence</head> withheld ; nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation reports might disclose . Section 6_(_j_) of the Act , as we have held , does require the Department 's recommendation to be placed in a registrant 's file . Gonzales_v._United_States , supra .

      <context> Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing_officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due_process because he did not succeed . It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing_officer 's report and notes at the trial . In_addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes . While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable <head>evidence</head> developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process . Moreover , his testimony at trial never developed any such facts . In the light of these circumstances , as_well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department 's recommendation , which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no relevancy in the hearing_officer 's report and notes . Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing_officer as_well as at the trial .</context>

      <context> For this period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; the ceramic material of the age is more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative_of the hopes and fears of its makers , who begin to show scenes of human life and death . Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece ; objects in gold , ivory , and bronze grow more numerous . Since writing was practiced in the Aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful . Though it is not easy to apply the <head>evidence</head> of the Iliad to any specific era , this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by 750 . The Dipylon_Geometric pottery of Athens and the Iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of Greek civilization ; but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending . Greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution , in which the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth . The revolution was well under_way before 700 B.C. , and premonitory signs go_back virtually across the century .</context>
