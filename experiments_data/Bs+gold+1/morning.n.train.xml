      <context> The return of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked_upon with indignant disapprobation and , in_fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty . In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in_order_to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers . Now , in 1961 , the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per_cent , or 5 million ) ; yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population . A Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going_in and out of the Birmingham_Oratory ( Catholic ) Church on Sunday <head>mornings</head> . She found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per_cent of English_people are churchgoers . She may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less_than ten . From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all_but empty during services .</context>

      <context> An area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use . The direction , velocity , and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area . Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call_for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable . Sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade , <head>morning</head> sun , or whatever may be most_desirable for the use intended . - Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , utilities , cleared land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site .</context>

The regiment was dug_in on the east_side of the river and the North_Koreans were steadily building_up a concentration of crack troops on the other side .

      <context> My great_grandmother , I have been told , made her garden her great pride ; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar ; she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden_heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed , and the plantain_lilies along the west_side of the house . These my grandmother left in their places ( they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man ) and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending . Three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment : the roses , whose petals might_not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume or rose tea to drink ; the peonies , whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying_on of_a finger , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them ; and the poppies . I have more_than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer <head>morning</head> and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals . Other flowers we might gather as we pleased : myrtle and white_violets from beneath the lilacs ; the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for_the_most_part beyond our reach ; snowballs ; hollyhock blossoms that , turned upside_down , make pink petticoated ladies ; and the little , dark_blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere . More potent a charm to bring back that time_of_life than this record of a_few pictures and a_few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in_the_beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them .

      <context> Henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe 's older and more serious brother , Morris , who was just_about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa , when he substituted for Rabbi_Jastrow at Rodeph_Shalom_Temple there during its Rabbi 's absence in Europe . Young Morris , who , while attending the University_of_Pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write Henrietta twenty page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of Sarah_Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` Sulamith '' on the Jewish reform_movement being promulgated by the Hebrew_Union_College in Cincinnati . Unlike his younger brother , Joe , he never presumed_to address her more familiarly than as `` My dear friend '' , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style . And when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the <head>morning</head> as she and Papa did . One thing Papa had not taught Henrietta was how to handle a young_man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself . She could not resist the opportunity `` of showing her superiority in argument over a man '' which she had remarked as one of the `` feminine follies '' of Sara_Sullam ; and in her forthright way , Henrietta , who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think_of men as the privileged '' and `` women as submissive and yielding '' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris_Jastrow took the slightest exception - he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair , as_well_as on the radical reforms of Dr._Wise of Hebrew_Union_College - until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given_up hope they would ever agree on anything . But that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard_Street .</context>

Before daylight Sunday <head>morning</head> , a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of Deputy_Sheriff_Frank_MacPherson of Catskill followed the trail to the house of Francisco_Chaves , where 100 to 150 Mexicans had gathered . MacPherson boldly approached the fortified adobe_house and demanded entrance . The men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even_though he offered medical_aid . The officer demanded the names of the injured men ; the Mexicans not_only refused to give them , but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it .</context>

      <context> There was never a doubt any_more how his structures would be received ; it was always the same unqualified success now . He could no_longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here_and_there he was taken_to_task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no_longer disputable as to its other values . Stowey_Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality . He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rose at half past six every <head>morning</head> , made himself some French coffee , had his corn_flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald_Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh_Gazette , then put_on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop . This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil_geologist . The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window_sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting_out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass_through a whole house , visible all_the_way up through wire gratings on each floor . His files , desk , drafting_board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos .</context>

Alex returned to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospects of a role , in the late afternoon , but found the doctor in an ebullient mood .

But after the doctor 's return that night Alex could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels , apparently giving its egg hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen . A knocking at Alex 's door roused him at six o'clock the following <head>morning</head> .

The doctor paid the bill and they repaired_to the hotel , room number nine , to initiate Alex further into these undertakings . The doctor opened the smallest of his cases , an unimposing straw bag , and exposed the contents for Alex 's inspection . Inside , carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside ; to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens ' eggs .</context>

One <head>morning</head> , we discovered not_only that the pennies were missing from the idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed_out in its lap . `` Now he 's bought_it '' , said my wife contentedly . `` No divinity will hold_still_for that .
