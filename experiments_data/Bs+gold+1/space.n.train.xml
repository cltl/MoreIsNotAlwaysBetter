      <context> We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound_waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite . So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states_of_matter , successive one_after_another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies . This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness . <head>Space</head> in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions . If the fourth_dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? It is not through space nor time that the time_machine most approved by science_fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever existent past fantasy future . Three seconds flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events .</context>

      <context> There are hordes of nubile young_women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry . It is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere - about 30 per_cent of the women and 25 per_cent of the men in the graduating_class - the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed_up the estimate . `` Almost everybody in the senior_class is married '' , students say dogmatically . And the school newspaper sells <head>space</head> to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the House_Plan_Association ) that have good news to impart . These announcements are , in_effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage_marts . There are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings , pinnings , ringings , engagements , and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity . `` Witt_House happily announces the engagement of Fran_Horowitz to Erwin_Schwartz of Fife_House '' .</context>

      <context> If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about * * f km of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic_energy less than their potential_energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . De_Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more_and_more eccentric without changing the semi major_axis . This effect can give_rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth . Since there is a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in <head>space</head> because of the radiation effects , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary_space . There are several possible sources . According_to Whipple ( 1955 ) , cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state . Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material .</context>

      <context> According_to Whipple ( 1955 ) , cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state . Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material . It is also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon . One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in <head>space</head> . Even in the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at_least four orders_of_magnitude . This large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved . Beyond a_few million kilometers from the Earth , but still in the region of the Earth 's orbit , a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable .</context>

      <context> There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment . Direct information has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors . In_addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain . From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal_light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of <head>space</head> near the ecliptic plane . Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component . The cores of deep sea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category . The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth .</context>

      <context> In the examples above , the occurrence of a bull's-eye , a straight haired mouse , or an ace could be called a `` success '' . In_general , any outcome we choose may be labeled `` success '' . The major question in this chapter is : What is the probability of exactly x successes in n trials ? In Chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples , usually by counting points in a sample <head>space</head> . Fortunately , a general formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind . Before deriving this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind '' . Experiments are often composed of several identical trials , and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated .</context>

      <context> Part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of Mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations . The Old_Ones neither helped nor hindered this plan ; time was not_yet . Their meditations were approaching a violent cusp that would shape Martian art for many millennia . On Earth elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited_edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation_marks and <head>spaces</head> ; Time_magazine reviewed it and suggested that the Federation_Assembly_Daily_Record should be translated into the medium . A colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs of plants and Mrs._Joseph_Shadow_of_Greatness_Douglas was quoted as saying : `` I would no_more sit_down without flowers on my table than without serviettes '' . A Tibetan swami from Palermo , Sicily , announced in Beverly_Hills a newly discovered , ancient yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and cosmic attraction between sexes . His chelas were required to assume the matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while he read aloud from Rig-Veda and an assistant guru examined their purses in another room - nothing was stolen ; the purpose was less immediate .</context>

      <context> `` What were they doing here '' ?

      <context> `` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to Franz_Kline and myself , `` the nothing that_is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non time '' . It is his relentlessness and unwavering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` The_Invasion_of_Cuba '' . In this work , his use of non color is startling and skillful . The sweep of <head>space</head> , the delicate counterbalance of the white masses , the over-all completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece . I asked Quasimodo recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and_then had her breathe on the canvas '' , which was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity .</context>
