      <context> Many things need to be checked . The size of the area alone can be a determining_factor . An area may be too small for the needs of the project . Areas should be large enough to include the attractions , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the <head>values</head> of the area from encroachment by private developments . Acreage in_excess_of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones . Shape of the area is also related_to the use attractions and needs of the development . A large picnic_area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in_width in_preference_to a long narrow area less_than one_hundred feet wide .</context>

      <context> A large picnic_area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in_width in_preference_to a long narrow area less_than one_hundred feet wide . This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions . However , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman 's trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit . The <head>values</head> of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there . For_instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might_not . The utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site . - Topography is very important .</context>

      <context> Inspiring - yes ; instructive - maybe ; duplicable - no ! But for the technical fact , we have the artist 's own testimony : `` Of_late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors . First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately * * f inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple <head>values</head> - the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark - by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns . If a human figure or wild_life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch . For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose . `` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .</context>

      <context> Some companies find a little imagination helpful . Hallmark_Cards_,_Inc. , Kansas_City , Mo. , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` Benefit_Bafflers '' , which it distributes to employees . M_+_R_Dietetic_Laboratories_,_Inc. , Columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook - each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe . U._S._Rubber_Company , New_York , passes out a form itemizing the <head>value</head> of benefits . The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for_example , costs $ 227.72 . Have the insurance_company or your own accounting department break_down the cost of your insurance package periodically . You may find certain coverage costing much more_than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions .</context>

      <context> Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development . This is a highly speculative venture . Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract .

If you have a year-round , full-time job you can n't expect to grow much more than your family uses - unless other members of the family do a good_deal of the work or you hire help .

In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 .</context>

      <context> Observing their distressing condition , Colonel_Snelling allowed these half starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation . As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota , Dousman of Michilimackinac , Michigan , and Prairie_du_Chien was traveling_to Red_River to open a trade in merchandise . Early in 1822 he was at Fort_Garry offering to bring_in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco . Alexander_McDonnell , governor of Red_River , and James_Bird , a chief factor of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , ordered such `` sundry articles '' to a <head>value</head> of 4500 . For its part the Hudson's_Bay_Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement . As the time drew_near for the drawing of the British American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the Pembina_colony - its own post and Fort_Daer - was on American territory . Accordingly Selkirk 's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by October , John_Halkett had torn_down both posts , floating the timber to `` the Forks '' in rafts .</context>

      <context> This combined experience , on a foundation of very average , I assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against . Perhaps a list of some of the `` practices '' of my company will help here . The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles . From an initial investment of $ 1200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present <head>value</head> estimated by some as exceeding $ 10000000 ( we do n't disclose financial figures to the public ) . Its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth ; and no limitation is in_evidence .

      <context> Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45 ` to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear . According_to Philippoff , the recoverable shear s is given by * * f where |c is the angle_of_extinction . From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the * * f calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face . There is another means which should show the direction and relative <head>value</head> of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as_such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields . These droplets are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one 's hands . These droplets appear to be ellipsoids , and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are . If they are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation .</context>

      <context> The new interchange among the four Los_Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square_mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller_Center in New_York . It is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls `` the highest and best use '' of centrally located urban land . As it affects the city 's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . Subways improved land <head>values</head> without taking_away land ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by_a_long_shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed . Downtown Los_Angeles is already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking_lot and garage - one of those preposterous `` if '' statistics has already come to pass . The freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access problem , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , isolating boundary . City planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might .</context>
