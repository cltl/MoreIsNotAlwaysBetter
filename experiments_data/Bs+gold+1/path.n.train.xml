      <context> `` Only a discontinuity can end it '' , Professor_Morrison writes . `` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' . Morrison points_out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet_Union or Red_China , it is the most vulnerable of the great_powers - Europe of_course must be written_off out_of_hand . He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United_States is the least risky <head>path</head> our government can take . His proposal is opposed to that of Richard_Nixon , Governor_Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic_Energy_Commission , Dr._Edward_Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold_war . These gentlemen are calling_for a resumption of testing - in the atmosphere - on the greatest possible scale , all in_the_name_of national security . Escalation is their first love and their last ; they will be faithful unto death .</context>

      <context> It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins ' pronouncement in Pleas_of_the_Crown from a metaphysical point_of_view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married_couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such_that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal_law as if there were no marriage . By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the <head>path</head> charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of law '' .</context>

      <context> Can the President or the Secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required ? Should the action be unilateral or multilateral ?

For , if so , the <head>path</head> leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem . What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in_general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it .

      <context> The bronchus and pulmonary_artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . The pulmonary_vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct <head>path</head> to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) . Another marked difference is noted here . The pulmonary_artery , in_addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) . The bronchial_artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply .</context>

      <context> First_of_all there was the parsonage , an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live_in , originally poorly conceived , apparently not repaired for years , with no plumbing or sewage , with rat-holes and rot . It was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church , a woman named Catt who , as Wilson afterward found , was briefly referred to as The_Cat because of her sharp_tongue and fierce initiative . Ann_Catt was a lonely , devoted soul , never married , conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church , but a perpetual dissenter and born critic . She soared over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the <head>path</head> and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository . Then Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition . The salary of the pastor had for years been $ 500 annually and even this was in_arrears . Wilson made_up_his_mind that he must receive at_least $ 2500 , but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said nothing .</context>

      <context> However , the litter remained , augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers . The street_cleaner had not_yet been around . One of the reporters called to him : `` Anything new , Lieutenant '' ? And he ignored him , skirting the parked cars and walking up the <head>path</head> to the Skopas house . When McFeeley was halfway to the door , the proprietor emerged - a mountainous , dark man , his head thick_with resiny black hair , his eyes like two of the black_olives he imported in boatloads . McFeeley identified himself . The master of the house , his nourished face unrevealing , consented to postpone his departure a_few minutes to talk to the detective .</context>

      <context> But the scene was not the quiet , calm scene I 'd expected . Four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars . Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds . I followed a shrubbery lined gravel <head>path</head> alongside the house to the pool . Two uniformed officers , a_couple_of plain-clothesmen I knew , and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left . At the pool 's far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned , and on the water 's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp looking lather . A_few yards beyond the group of men , a man 's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra .</context>
