      <context> A story , no_doubt apocryphal , for Mercer himself denies it , has him sporting a monocle in those Village days . Though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade_mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers . One day in a bar , so the legend goes , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monocle and broke it . The innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of <head>honor</head> found in bars , insisted upon replacing the destroyed monocle - and did , over the protests of the former owner - with a square monocle . Mercer is_supposed_to have refused it with , `` Anyone who wears a square monocle must be affected '' ! Everett_Miller , then assistant director for the Garrick_Gaieties , a Theatre_Guild production , needed a lyricist for a song he had written ; he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however . For him Mercer produced the lyric to `` Out_of_Breath_Scared_to_Death_of_You '' , introduced in that most successful of all the Gaieties , by Sterling_Holloway .</context>

      <context> The Providence_Daily_Journal , however , stated that Brown 's courage , bravery , and heroism `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; it gives something of dignity even to a bad one '' . The Woonsocket_Patriot admitted that John_Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no_more be hung than Henry_A._Wise or James_Buchanan '' . The Newport_Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him . In her letter to John_Brown , `` E._B. '' , the Quakeress from Newport , had suggested that the American people owed more <head>honor</head> to John_Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George_Washington . During the latter days of November to the day of Brown 's execution , it seems that most Rhode_Islanders did not concur in `` E._B. 's '' suggestion . On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown 's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions . A week later the Daily_Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John_Brown on the day of his execution .</context>

      <context> `` I must n't tell , I must n't tell '' , she repeated to herself . `` I promised him I would n't '' . Winter came , and with it Mary 's baby - a boy as she had wished . William , he was called , in <head>honor</head> of the man who was at_once Shelley 's pensioner and his most bitter detractor . With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter : `` Fanny and Mrs._Godwin will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement , and that her child is well '' . At_the_same_time another child - this one of Shelley 's brain - was given to the world : Alastor , a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind 's musings .</context>
