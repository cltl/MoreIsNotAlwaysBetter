      <context> There is no framework or structure of thought with_respect_to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with_respect_to which we can refer this experience . Science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives . The situation in which we find ourselves is brought_out with dramatic force in Arthur_Miller 's play The_Crucible , which deals with the Salem witch trials . As the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of Salem in Puritan <head>America</head> at the end of the eighteenth century . Aside_from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community . The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age . There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people .</context>

      <context> To say this , of_course , is to take_up a position on one side of a controversy going_on now for some two hundred years , or , at_any_rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought . We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at_least , Bultmann . It is to this same tradition that most_of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong . For we must number here not_only the names of Bushnell , Clarke , and Rauschenbusch , not_to_mention those of `` the Chicago_School '' and Macintosh , but those of the brothers Niebuhr and ( if <head>America</head> may claim him ! ) Tillich as_well . Finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that developed at the University_of_Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred_North_Whitehead . What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged_to it have been profoundly in_earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern_world .</context>

      <context> Your invitation to write_about Serge_Prokofieff to honor his 70_th Anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya_Muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because I admire the music of Prokofieff ; and with sober purpose , because the development of Prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics . The Serge_Prokofieff whom we knew in the United_States_of_America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur - and very capable as a professional musician . These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post World_War_1 , era . Prokofieff 's outlook as a composer pianist conductor in <head>America</head> was , indeed , brilliant . Prokofieff 's Classical_Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well trained musician still in his twenties . To the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; to the Neo Classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world . What was it to Prokofieff ?</context>

Certainly , <head>America</head> took Prokofieff and his Classical_Symphony seriously , and with a good_deal of pleasure . His life-long friend , Serge_Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , New_York , and Washington , D._C. , to_which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation . Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world_premiere of the Love_for_Three_Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third_Piano_Concerto . `` Uncle_Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden_Twenties '' .</context>

      <context> `` Uncle_Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden_Twenties '' . We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano_sonatas , chamber_music , gavottes , and marches ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities . We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers . Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich <head>America</head> - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms . So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting_grounds of `` Uncle_Sam '' ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought . Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing .</context>

Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing .

      <context> Nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of American life , that learned societies such_as the American_Folklore_Society and the American_Historical_Association were founded in the 1880's , or that courses in American literature , American civilization , American anything have swept our school and college curricula . Of_course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth century United_States . Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man_in_the_street . It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time <head>America</head> is spreading her dominion over palm and pine .

      <context> Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter . In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this . Enthusiastically , Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul_Bunyan tales , Abe_Lincoln anecdotes and labor_union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition . Nor have we remembered that in the melting_pot of <head>America</head> the hundreds of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material .

      <context> And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free_world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . In the recent political_campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus . One was demonstrably false ; the other , for_the_most_part , true . The first was that <head>America</head> had become - or was in_danger_of becoming - a second-rate military power . I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention . You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment - I certainly do - but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United_States not_only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U._S. - Soviet relations for the foreseeable future . I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr._Jameson_Campaigne has done it well in his new book American_Might_and_Soviet_Myth .</context>

Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep_abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength . If we look_at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev 's nightmarish worries - or , at_least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage . The other charge was that <head>America</head> 's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years . The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world_affairs can quarrel with it . The argument was typically advanced in_terms_of U._S. `` prestige '' . Prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ; and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading .</context>

      <context> All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did . Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties . But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South - to use the moderate words favored by Mr._Thomas_Griffith - finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North . And this , in_effect , means most of modern <head>America</head> . It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise . And therein , I feel , many Northerners delude themselves about the South .

They believe that if the South had been let_alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern <head>America</head> . As_it_is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in_spite_of its high standard_of_living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter . The South 's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure . Their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners ; and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as_much_as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home_town .</context>

      <context> In a book review of `` The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State_Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West_Contacts_Staff in_order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy_and_Bess ' overrode the State_Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz_musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo_montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry_Ford , Hugh_Cooper , Thomas_Campbell , the International_Harvester_Co. , and David_W._Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of <head>America</head> in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' . Perhaps the public 's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no_more exists in America . In his stead is a milquetoast version known_as `` the corporation '' . But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ; and our loss of `` prestige '' abroad is the direct result .</context>

      <context> The religion supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values . Even in the united_states , with its freedom of religious_belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values . This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value_orientation elsewhere ; for_example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism . In <head>America</head> also all_of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common religion . Even the non church_members - the freewheelers , marginal religionists and_so_on - have the values of Christian civilization internalized in them . Furthermore , religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values ; for_example , those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends . Finally , it gives sanctity , more than human legitimacy , and even , through super empirical reference , transcendent and supernatural importance to some values ; for_example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the state as a divine instrument .</context>

      <context> A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and <head>America</head> , broke this unity and this universality . It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action . To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy .</context>

      <context> If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children 's clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too_much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount_business in big-ticket items . Department_stores were built_on dry_goods , especially ladies ' fashions , and in this area , in_the_long_run , the suburban branches will be hard_put to compete against downtown . If this analysis is correct , the suburban branches will turn_out to be what management 's cost_accountants refuse to acknowledge , marginal operations rather_than major factors . Historically in <head>America</head> the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered . `` How ya gonna keep ' em down on the farm '' ? was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree . Though Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious_belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown .</context>

      <context> This set his tone : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as_well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off 's rent for a year . He was fifteen years older than I - forty four - but full of spring and sparkle . He did n't look_like what I thought_of as an old_man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger . He was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in <head>America</head> ; you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every_month . Life had included him in its `` Modern American Artists '' series and had photographed him at his studio in the East_Sixties ; the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have Velasquez in it painting the royalty of Spain . I had a long talk with him . We went_into Mrs._Monmouth 's library , which had low bookshelves all along the walls , and above them a Modigliani portrait , a Jackson_Pollock twelve feet long , and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow background , that looked_like an inscription from a Martian tomb .</context>
