      <context> The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior_designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into <head>focus</head> one important difference_of_opinion . The architects do not believe that the education of the interior_designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round_tables , workshops or panel_discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled_down crux_of_the_matter is education . It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more .</context>

      <context> The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia . This patient was a 65 - year old white male accountant who entered the New_York_Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . In 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood_transfusions were given over a period of 4 years . Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered <head>foci</head> of fibrosis '' suggestive_of myelofibrosis . No additional transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily . This medication was continued until February , 1958 . In February , 1958 , the patient suffered a myocardial_infarction complicated by pulmonary edema .</context>

      <context> They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held . But the eagerly sought `` homogeneity '' of the Balafrej Council_of_Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled over foreign_policy , labor politics and economic development . By December , 1958 , when ' Abdallah_Ibrahim became President_of_the_Council , elections had even greater importance . They were increasingly looked_upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the <head>focus</head> of a new , constructive national effort . To minimize the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government was formed a titre personnel and a special office was created in the Ministry_of_the_Interior to plan and to conduct the elections . By this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete . There remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws through the labyrinth of Palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions .</context>

      <context> Thus , besides the training provided to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts . Few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry . The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad_hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment_training_programs that my be quickly set_up in a community to aid a new industrial plant . The major weakness of vocational training_programs in labor surplus areas is their <head>focus</head> on serving solely local job demands . This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country . Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained_workers . All the manuals for setting_up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the growth of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content .</context>

      <context> A related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided . There is little evidence that existing public or private training_programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs , even though they must pay tuition , receive no subsistence payments , and are not guaranteed a job . However , there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training . Again , one major difficulty is the local <head>focus</head> . A training_program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community . If there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere , many_more workers can be expected to respond . Another problem is who will pay for the training .</context>

      <context> Local school districts are hard_pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training . Programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business_leaders demand it . Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in_sight and requests it . State_governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational_schools , but their <head>focus</head> is still on area job opportunities . Only the Federal_government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs . If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states . However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment .</context>

      <context> Much which was in_embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 . In this process the Minoan Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected ; the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800 . Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times - granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside - are correct ; but all_too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took_place in the early first millennium . The <head>focus</head> of novelty in this world now lay_in the south-eastern districts of the Greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean , always excepting its northern shores , had accepted the Geometric style of pottery . While Protogeometric vases usually turn_up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as_many or more examples of local stamp , these `` non Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century . In their place came local variations within the common style - tentative , as_it_were , in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed . Attica , though important , was not the only teacher of this age .</context>
