The grand_jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton_County purchasing_departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' . However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' . The City_Purchasing_Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel <head>policies</head> '' . It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem . Implementation of Georgia 's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury . It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so_that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' .</context>

      <context> Check to see if some of your benefits - such_as on-the-job disability pay - can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you . Use deductable insurance wherever feasible . It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates . Also , beware of open_end <head>policies</head> , especially in the medical field . This will mean that every time there 's an increase in hospital rates your cost will go_up in like manner . Put a dollar and cents limit on benefits . Do n't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death .</context>

      <context> Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant - in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the United_Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences - preferably at the highest level . The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first_step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West . Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country . The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in_fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet <head>policy</head> . And this may be as far as the process will go . The Kremlin 's goal is the isolation and capture , not of Ghana , but of the United_States - and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a `` neutralist '' mask , yet in_fact are dependable auxiliaries of the Soviet Foreign_Office . To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring .</context>

      <context> Six years ago French_Indochina , though in troubie , was in the Western camp . Today Northern_Vietnam is overtly Communist ; Laos is teetering between Communism and pro Communist neutralism ; Cambodia is , for_all_practical_purposes , neutralist . Indonesia , in the early_days of the Republic , leaned toward the West . Today Sukarno 's government is heavily besieged by avowed Communists , and for all_of its `` neutralist '' pretensions , it is a firm ally of Soviet <head>policy</head> . Ceylon has moved from a pro Western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West . In the Middle_East , Iraq , Syria and Egypt were , a short while ago , in the Western camp . Today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West , are dependent for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel ; in almost every particular follow the Kremlin 's foreign_policy line .</context>

      <context> These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism . This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in_practice , antithetical to these conditions ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization . Moreover , as Communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro_rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote . It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant , proximate goal of American <head>policy</head> . Proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive '' ends we seek , to which victory over Communism is but a means . But dominant in the sense that every other objective , no_matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it . Peace is a worthy objective ; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin , then we must fight .</context>

      <context> Freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ; but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit , then Algerian freedom must be postponed . Justice is a worthy objective ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union_of_South_Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer . Prosperity is a worthy objective ; but if providing higher standards_of_living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made . It may be , of_course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a <head>policy</head> designed to overthrow Communism ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in_favor_of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of Soviet Communist power . This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used . This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power . I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be .</context>

      <context> I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them . If they were , Walter_Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George_Sokolsky , and Herblock would have nothing to draw cartoons about . I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions . The ultimate objective of American <head>policy</head> is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity ; and in_particular - since this is our special responsibility - that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United_States . I speak_of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved - ever - reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human_beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around . These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism .

      <context> Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence . Related_to , but distinguishable from , nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another . Increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions . The efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions , particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of industrialization , led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby <head>policy</head> could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions . Law became a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking_to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms . Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no_longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed .

      <context> The legislative mills have been grinding ever since , and when its cumbersome processes were no_longer adequate_to the task , a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another , to the executive . Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law . Indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific . In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize <head>policy</head> by increasing the power of parliament - the elected representatives - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary . When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit - when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands - two purposes were served : Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law became a rational system for implementing that will , for serving conscious goals , for embodying the `` public policy '' . It is true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , inhibited the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy . Law was seen as an emanation of the `` sovereign will '' .</context>
