      <context> The appointment was announced at a news_conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw 's staff - Jerry_Williams and Charlie_Gauer . Williams is a defensive coach . Gauer works with the ends . The <head>selection</head> had been expected . Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm_Van_Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching_job with the Minnesota_Vikings , the newest National_Football_League entry . Van_Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player .</context>

      <context> Fourth , the two indicators are for_the_most_part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center . The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood . Onsets , Completions , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile . It may be assumed that differences in ratings due_to <head>selection</head> of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according_to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body . Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence . It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as_well_as Hand , it seems to be the method_of_choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood .</context>

      <context> Even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt 's motel has been relatively painless ; the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every_year . What hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing , especially in those cities where public_transit is feeble . Some retailing , of_course , always spreads with the population - grocery_stores , drugstores , local haberdasheries and dress_shops , candy_stores and the_like . But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago - a new bedroom_set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior - the family set_off for the downtown department_store , where the <head>selection</head> would be greatest . Department_stores congregated in the `` one_hundred per_cent location '' , where all the transit_lines converged . These stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more_and_more dry_goods . If the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar_volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put_in the bank .</context>
