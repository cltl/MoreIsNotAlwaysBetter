      <context> `` I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going_to be any 25th man on the ball_club '' . This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout . Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a .130 batting average in the first 12 games . He took a midnight train out of <head>Cleveland</head> Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across_the_nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe_Ann_Olsen , awaited . She said , when she learned Jackie was heading_home : `` I'm just speculating , but I have_to think Jack feels he 's hurting Boston 's chances '' .

      <context> His plunder is therefore far higher - running into hundreds of millions . According_to the Food_and_Drug_Administration ( FDA ) , `` Doctor '' Ghadiali , Dr._Albert_Abrams and his clique , and Dr._Wilhelm_Reich - to name three notorious device quacks - succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines . Authorities believe that many_of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business . Look_at the sums paid by two device quack victims in <head>Cleveland</head> . Sarah_Gross , a dress_shop proprietor , paid $ 1020 to a masseur , and Mr._A. , a laborer , paid $ 4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines - the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' . Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually . You will come_up with a frightening total .</context>

      <context> The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of_course . But it is our health - more precious than all the money in the world - that these modern witch_doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away . By preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical_care , these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity . Typically , Sarah_Gross and Mr._A both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their <head>Cleveland</head> quacks . Sarah_Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her . As a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor '' was using were phony . She suffered a nervous_breakdown and had to be institutionalized .</context>
