      <context> Regarding Atlanta 's new million dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes_charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' .

      <context> `` I feel good physically '' , Hansen added , `` but I think I 'll move better carrying a_little less weight than I'm carrying now '' . The rangy , Albany ( Cal. ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as_well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding '' as his 1961 goal . `` I think I can do a better job with the glove , now that I know the hitters around the league a_little better '' , he said . Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami_Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two game <head>weekend</head> series with the New_York Yankees . Skinny_Brown and Hoyt_Wilhelm , the Flock 's veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the American_League champions in tomorrow 's 8 P.M. contest . Ryne_Duren and Roland_Sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15 - 1 record last year for the Yanks ' Auburn ( N.Y. ) farm_club of the Class - D New_York-Pennsylvania_League , are the probable rival pitchers . Twenty-one year old Milt_Pappas and Jerry_Walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers ' Art_Ditmar in Sunday 's 2 P.M. encounter .</context>

Ralph_Houk , successor to Casey_Stengel at the Yankee helm , plans to bring the entire New_York squad here from St._Petersburg , including Joe_Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both <head>weekend</head> games . The famed Yankee_Clipper , now retired , has been assisting as a batting_coach . Pitcher Steve_Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army 's accelerated wintertime military course , also at Fort_Knox , Ky. . The 22 - year old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen .</context>

      <context> I can't throw . Suddenly my reflexes are gone . Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . And so it was over the <head>weekend</head> what with 40 - year old Warren_Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants ' Willie_Mays retaliating with a record tying 4 - homer spree Sunday . Both , of_course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . It was a real stimulant to a_lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2 - score year milestone .</context>

      <context> `` He should be getting_back in_the_groove before_long . Our pitching is much better than it has shown '' . The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch_Stadium yesterday . Until the Bucs ' bats quieted_down a_bit in Cincinnati over the <head>weekend</head> , the champions had eight men hitting over .300 . Despite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky_Burgess .455 , Gino_Cimoli .389 , Bill_Virdon .340 , Bob_Clemente and Dick_Groat , each .323 , Dick_Stuart .306 , Don_Hoak .280 and Bob_Skinner .267 . Bill_Mazeroski with .179 and Hal_Smith with .143 were the only Pirates dragging_their_feet . Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit_out most of the series is Bob_Friend , who was beaten by The_Man twice last season on dramatic home_runs .</context>

      <context> But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial_art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia . On the death of their father , they returned to their home in Batavia , New_York . After more years of concentrated effort , Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family_business at the old stand . During all this time Roy continued to paint , first only on <head>weekends</head> , and_then , as the family_business permitted , for longer periods . Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions . But even on these , the palette often takes_over while the shotgun cools_off ! Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey_Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had - and this was limited to a_few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together - Roy developed his art by himself .</context>

      <context> Seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more . Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable . Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with . They are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned_away , especially on holiday <head>weekends</head> . The National_Parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure . The National_Park_Service hopes by 1966 to have 30000 campsites available for 100000 campers a day - almost twice what there are at_present . The U._S._Forest_Service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests and is increasing its facilities steadily .</context>

      <context> Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $ 10.50 food bill along with most_of the tip money . The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can n't either eliminate or pare_down drastically by camping along the way . Where Americans used_to think_of a single vacation each summer , they now think_about how many vacations they can have . Long <head>weekends</head> enable many to get_away from home for three or four days several times a year . And even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces . It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they 're buying the comforts of home . They 're not .</context>

      <context> Though Bob_Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown_off by the exploding grenade , he lived . Today he is a major - in the Regular_Army . So filled was Mel_Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was over , he took_on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment . After years of digging , nights and <head>weekends</head> , he put_together the big , profusely illustrated book , Of_Garryowen_and_Glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military_unit . The battle of the Naktong_River is just one example of how the battle_cry and the spirit of The Fighting_Seventh have paid_off . For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment . Take the case of Major_Marcus_A._Reno , who survived the Battle_of_The_Little_Big_Horn in 1876 .</context>

      <context> Warm clothing and bedding , of_course , are essential . Open flame heating or cooking should be avoided . A flame would use_up air . Some families already have held <head>weekend</head> rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need . Few areas , if any , are as_good_as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about . A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation . On the ground_floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside .</context>

      <context> Jane nodded with a pleasant smile . `` All_right . There was a sniper 's nest in a mountain cave , and it was picking_off our men with devilish accuracy . The Colonel ordered that it be wiped_out , and I suggested , ' You ask for volunteers , and promise each man on the patrol a quart of whisky , ten dollars and a <head>week-end</head> pass to Davao ' . Trig was one of the five volunteers . The patrol snaked around in back of the cave , approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls . You could hear them from our outpost .</context>

Still , just for the ladies , and just for this once , for this one <head>weekend</head> in the country , he would make a little piece out of his melodies . The ladies were delighted and Jean_Jacques was applauded . And everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote . But then , after the little operetta had been given its feeble amateur rendering , everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever , and that the Royal_Academy_of_Music must now have the manuscript in_order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited .</context>

      <context> For Felix it was a_bit of a stretch to make even that measurement . The man was just this side of being a freak . We waited till he had finished laughing , and that gave us a_few moments for taking_stock of him . He was dressed in a manner Esquire might suggest for the outdoor_man 's country <head>weekend</head> . Dark gray sports_jacket , lighter gray slacks , pink flannel shirt , black silk necktie . His eyes were clear . He was freshly shaved , and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have missed detecting some scent of_it on the massive gusts of his laughter .</context>
