      <context> Strange , but true - authenticity and realism often are n't related at_all . Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic - in_fact , impeccably so . In any given period_piece the costumes , bric-a-brac , vehicles , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity . The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this <head>matter</head> . During the making recently of an important Biblical film , some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not_only of costumes and interiors , but of architectural developments , sports_arenas , vehicles , and other paraphernalia were compiled , consulted , and complied with . But , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set 's edge .

      <context> The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester_Guardian and the Sunday_Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic_Church is now at_least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches . On successive Sundays during October , 1960 , Paul_Ferris ( a non-Catholic ) wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen of the Church_of_England , the Church_of_Rome and the Nonconformist_Church . The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came_out the best . There were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious <head>matters</head> and without really very_much to do as clergyman . Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public_press of mid Victorian England . There was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on B.B.C. , where comments were equally made by an Anglican parson , a Free_Church minister and a Catholic priest . Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television_programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen .</context>

      <context> Every dream , and this is true of a mental_image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic_phenomenon for which no explanation is available . In most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects . But these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we do n't remember having seen in real_life . For_instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and , with photographic realism , sees Smith driving the car ; whereas , it is a <head>matter</head> of fact that Smith cannot drive a car . There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams . The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental_image can find no logical support . A `` mental_image '' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at_all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth_dimension .</context>

In_other_words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted_on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder . This , in_fact , it turned_out to be . Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed_forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of_it , conscious accomplices of Hitler 's crimes ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a <head>matter</head> to be determined individually .

      <context> Repeated polls have disclosed that most married_couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth_control . For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and <head>matters</head> of theological belief . Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil_law is concerned with public crimes . Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil_authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin . Among the chief victims of such an ill_conceived imposition would be religion itself .</context>

Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached . `` All_too frequently '' , points_out James_O'_Gara , managing_editor of Commonweal , `` Catholics run_roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this <head>matter</head> , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth_control has changed in recent decades '' . All_too often our language is unduly harsh . The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family_planning . Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .</context>

His denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no_doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the South or have written_about the South .</context>
