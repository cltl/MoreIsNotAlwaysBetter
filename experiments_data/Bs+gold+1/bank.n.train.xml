      <context> Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal_year next Aug. 31 . He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on_the_books `` since Texas was a republic '' . It permits the state to take_over bank_accounts , stocks and other personal_property of persons missing for seven years or more . The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force <head>banks</head> , insurance_firms , pipeline_companies and other corporations to report such property to the state_treasurer . The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . Dewey_Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas_Bankers_Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . `` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said .</context>

      <context> It is , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not_only has Mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure .

      <context> As they were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two bluffs , a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers . Not a bullet touched Cook who was nearer the ambush , but one hit Russell in the leg and another broke his arm , passing_on through his body . With the first reports , Russell 's horse wheeled to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook , followed by a hail of bullets , raced towards the arroyo of Salyer_'s_Canyon immediately in_front_of him , just reaching it as his horse fell . Grabbing his Winchester from its sheath , Cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo <head>bank</head> . Bullets were so thick , throwing sand in his face , that he found it difficult to return the fire . Noticing Russell 's horse in_front_of the long log building , he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put_up a good fight , so he began working his way down the ditch to join him . At a very shallow place , two Mexicans rushed into the open for a shot .</context>

      <context> At_any_rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington . In 1846 Matthew_B._Goodwin , jeweler and watchmaker , became the town 's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the Equinox_House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont '' . Goodwin was telegrapher for the `` American_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Troy_and_Canada_Junction_Telegraph_Company '' . Shares of capital_stock at $ 15 each in the latter company were payable at the Bank_of_Manchester or at various other Vermont <head>banks</head> . A message of less_than fifteen words to Bennington cost twenty-five cents . By 1871 L._C._Orvis , manager of the `` Western_Union_Telegraph_Company '' , expressed willingness to send emergency telegrams on Sundays from his Village drugstore .

      <context> But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago - a new bedroom_set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior - the family set_off for the downtown department_store , where the selection would be greatest . Department_stores congregated in the `` one_hundred per_cent location '' , where all the transit_lines converged . These stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more_and_more dry_goods . If the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar_volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put_in the <head>bank</head> . In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated . No suburban shopping-center branch - not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store . Telephone_orders distort the picture :</context>
