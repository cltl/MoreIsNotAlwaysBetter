      <context> He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due_to glaucoma . The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in Fig. 6 . The transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown . For display , Dr._Baum uses a portion of an * * f , an airborne radar <head>indicator</head> , and_then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record . A typical `` sonogram '' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in Fig. 5 . The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc. and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter . The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90 - degree arc in_front_of the eye to `` look_into '' all corners .</context>

      <context> Figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for each growth center . Forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this monograph have been included in the Appendix . The principles used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of Figures 5 and 6 as_well_as all figures in the Appendix . One growth center in a short_bone - distal phalanx of the second finger - was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion , the maturity <head>indicator</head> for Completion in long and short_bones , occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage . Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , dietary patterns , and health during adolescence . The following summary , based on Figures 5 and 6 , is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with_respect_to the appropriate mean age for each growth center . At the top of Figure 5 , for_example , the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according_to their mean and standard_deviation values in Table 1 .</context>

      <context> Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence . It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as_well_as Hand , it seems to be the method_of_choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood . As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions - particularly the former - provide a different tool or <head>indicator</head> of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period . Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress . It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2 . As one approach to doing this , Figures 3 and 4 have been constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 .</context>

      <context> This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock_therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl_test . Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl_test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm . Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not_yet been tested on an adequate number of patients . The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable <head>indicators</head> of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable . It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep wakefulness cycle . A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting . In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such_as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs .</context>
