      <context> The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League_clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas_City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . Indications as_late_as the <head>top</head> of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory drought as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage . Over the first five frames , Jack_Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in_the_middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American_League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick_Hyde , submarine_ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock . A two run homer by Norm_Siebern and a solo_blast by Bill_Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts .</context>

      <context> Rookie Ron_Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made_it two straight over Indianapolis , 5 - 3 . The husky 6 - 3 , 205 - pound lefthander , was in command all_the_way before an on_the_scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . It was Nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight . They now lead Louisville by a full game on <head>top</head> of the American_Association pack . Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley_Hinton in the third inning . He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday 's opener , and never lagged .</context>

      <context> A year later they were 4 - 13 . Since 1949 , the St._Louis club has been below .500 on May 1 just four times . The '49 team was off to a so-so 5 - 5 beginning , then fell as low as 12 - 17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories . The '52 Cards were 6 - 7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club 's <head>top</head> since 1949 . Then last season the_Birds tumbled as low as 11 - 18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . Since 1949 , the only National_League club that got_off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team . Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 .</context>

      <context> We put a light mulch over the seedlings ; now we must use a heavy one . Three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool . When winter comes be ready with additional mulch . I like hay for this and apply it so_that only the <head>tops</head> of the plants show right after a good frost . That keeps_in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing . Do n't miss the pansies that appear from_time_to_time through the winter . Whenever there is a thaw or a_few sunny days , you 'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two .</context>

      <context> A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . It consists_of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . There is a small well in the <head>top</head> in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . A tape of cellulose_acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . In normal use weights are hung_on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . After it has reached terminal_velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded .</context>

      <context> `` Hush '' , said Uncle_Randolph , smiling , `` or I 'll give you another black_eye '' . He patted the eye Joel had had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads some days back . Kate had no idea what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night , had heard horsemen on the River_Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn . Stranger , Uncle_Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle , drunkenly singing `` Old_Dan_Tucker '' at the <head>top</head> of his voice . Hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road , Kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house , cold_sober . What he was_about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by General_McClellan , threatening reprisals against Rebel guerrillas . She was taken_up in worry for the reckless old_man .</context>

      <context> The air took_on a special strength now that they 'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind . There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt_water , clams , seaweed and northern air . He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin wife as the last century ended . Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on <head>top</head> of the headland and coming_upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant . `` Remember the Starbird ? '' Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came_down . `` The_Starbird , '' Abel said .</context>

      <context> The grocery the youth worked for soon tired_of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go . The beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off . Reduced to beggary , he at_last got a job as office_boy to a television producer . His hubris , deficiency of taste , and sadism carried him straightaway to the <head>top</head> . He evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks , and quickly superseded his boss . Not long_ago , I rode down with him in an elevator in Radio_City ; he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at_once , clearly a man in_extremis . `` See that guy '' ? the operator asked pityingly .</context>
