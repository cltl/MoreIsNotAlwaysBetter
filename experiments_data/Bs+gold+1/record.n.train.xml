Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami_Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two game weekend series with the New_York Yankees . Skinny_Brown and Hoyt_Wilhelm , the Flock 's veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the American_League champions in tomorrow 's 8 P.M. contest .

      <context> Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James_P._Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . Garden_Fresh , the result of a mating of Better_Self and Rosy_Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St._Patrick's_Day_Purse with some speed in reserve . She was moving_up to the allowance department after winning a $ 10000 claiming event . George_Kerr , the swift striding Jamaican , set a meet <head>record</head> in the 600 - yard run in the Knights_of_Columbus track_meet tonight , beating Purdue 's Dave_Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . Kerr , who set the world_record earlier this month in New_York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped_out Mills 's early pace and beat the young Big_10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal_Whitfield . Mills shot out in_front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race .</context>

      <context> I can't throw . Suddenly my reflexes are gone . Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . And so it was over the weekend what with 40 - year old Warren_Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants ' Willie_Mays retaliating with a <head>record</head> tying 4 - homer spree Sunday . Both , of_course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . It was a real stimulant to a_lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2 - score year milestone .</context>

      <context> Inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph_Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey . The Major decided that , rather_than be led , the slugger could lead . And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so_far . The opinion continues here that with a 162 - game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10 - team league and a most inviting target in Los_Angeles ' Wrigley_Field_Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous <head>record</head> on the books , Babe_Ruth 's 60 homers of 1927 . Mays ' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year . Willie 's wonderful walloping Sunday - four home_runs - served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin_Dark . Next to Leo_Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass green rookie rushed up_to the Polo_Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant .</context>

Although it was at the Battle_of_The_Little_Horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history , that the 7_th_Cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then . Brevet_Major_General_George_Armstrong_Custer was the regiment 's first permanent commander and , like such generals as George_S._Patton and Terry_de_la_Mesa_Allen in their rise to military prominence , Custer was a believer in blood_and_guts warfare .

A proposed loan must be for sound purposes or sufficiently secured so_as to assure a reasonable chance of repayment . The <head>record</head> of past earnings and prospects for the future must indicate it has the ability to repay the loan out of current and anticipated income .

Business loans generally are repayable in regular installments - usually monthly , including interest at the rate of 5 - 1/2 percent per_annum on the unpaid balance - and have a maximum maturity of 10 years ; the term of loans for working_capital is 6 years .</context>

      <context> This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute .

      <context> A goal was fixed , as given in Table 2 , and attention focused_on its fulfillment . The qualifications to vote were kept very simple . Both men and women of twenty-one years of_age could register and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification . There were liberal provisions for dispensation where documents or <head>records</head> were lacking . The police were disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens , criminals and those punished for Protectorate activities . The registration figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit of a reliable census .</context>
