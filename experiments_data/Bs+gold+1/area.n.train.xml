      <context> We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry . The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality . When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering . The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this <head>area</head> alone , the application of electronic_equipment has enormous possibilities . The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by_far than any previous medical discovery . We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research . Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray_machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy_machine .</context>

      <context> When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O_'_Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $ 20000 a month . In six months O_'_Banion had boosted the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb . These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; once_again O_'_Banion 's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill_will . The revenue from O_'_Banion 's Cicero territory went_up still higher , until the yield was more_than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade <head>area</head> of Chicago 's South and West_Sides . But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate . At_last , even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O_'_Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in_return for one from his Cicero beer concession . O_'_Banion 's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .</context>

      <context> Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high_school described in my first report . The separate vocational or technical high_schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions . By_and_large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system . It is not often realized to_what_degree certain trades are in many communities closed <head>areas</head> of employment , except for a lucky few . One has_to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high_schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` I want to be a plumber '' , and then , by doing good work , find a job . It is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get_into the most selective medical_school in the nation . Two stories will illustrate what I have_in_mind .</context>

      <context> Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society . Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by_any_means other_than the corporate form , e._g. constructing major airports or dams . Thus , if corporations are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject_to public control and needs . In all other <head>areas</head> , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services . Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human_beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests . Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot . It can project long-range goals for itself .</context>

      <context> There have been a number of sound plans proposed . But none of these has been implemented . Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping_hand . Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan <head>areas</head> each_day has increased tremendously since World_War_2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957 . Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New_York_City area . Here the New_York_Central_Railroad , one of the Nation 's most important carriers , has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949 . At this time of crisis in our Nation 's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New_York_Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake_+_Ohio_Railroad 's proposal for control of the Baltimore_+_Ohio_railroads .</context>

      <context> The New_York_Central has pointed_out that this control , if approved by the Interstate_Commerce_Commission , would give the combined C.+O. - B.+O._Railroad a total of 185 points served in_common with the New_York_Central . Not_only is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New_York_Central and other railroads serving the area . The New_York_Central notes : `` The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. +_O._-_B. +_O. provides the backbone of Central 's revenues . These revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New_York_Central system as_well_as the New_York <head>area</head> commuter and terminal freight services . If these services are to be maintained , the New_York_Central must have the revenues to make them possible '' . The New_York_Central today handles 60 percent of all southbound commuter_traffic coming into New_York_City . This is a $ 14 million operation involving 3500 employees who work_on commuter_traffic exclusively .</context>

      <context> The actual change * * f caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume , just_as_it_is for any gravitational or osmotic_pressure head . If the volume is the molal volume , then * * f is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists . Although the * * f calculation is obvious by_analogy_with that for gravitational_field and osmotic_pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects . Consider a shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional <head>area</head> of A opposed by a manometer with a height of h ( referred to the same base as H ) and a cross-sectional area of a . If * * f is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and |r is the density of the fluid , then the total potential_energy of the system above the reference height is * * f . * * f is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h . The total volume of the system above the reference height is * * f , and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential_energy of the system in_terms_of H .</context>

      <context> One might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse . In_addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog . Anatomically , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others ( Birnbaum , ' 54 ) in the human_being . The only <head>area</head> in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard_to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries . As early as 1858 , Le_Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries in human_beings . In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz . The opposition to this point_of_view has its staunchest support in the work of Miller ( ' 50 ) .</context>

      <context> Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . For_example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . Let us now put some flesh_on_the_theoretical_bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . One should keep in mind that many_of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other <head>areas</head> . The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive - and the rate_of_attrition due_to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high . It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired - and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed .</context>

      <context> While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure . The objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts . In_addition , the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed . The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training <head>area</head> . The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold : Spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new .</context>

      <context> This movement of industry away from the central_cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe . It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities . The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities - the rubber factories in Akron , Chrysler 's Detroit plants , U._S._Steel 's Pittsburgh works - often began on these sites at_a_time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( piers ) and power ( river ) . The `` leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam_turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory <head>area</head> were not_yet blighted . The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in selecting his plant site . Until internal_combustion became cheap , he had_to be near a railroad_siding and a trolley_line or an existing large community of lower-class homes . The railroad_siding is still important - it is usually , though not always , true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper than trucking .</context>

      <context> Not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese . In news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs . `` While Henry_Morgan was escorting Miss_Vera_Green from the church social last Saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit Mr._Morgan on the public_square '' . Such items recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie_star : `` The <head>area</head> in which Miss_N - was injured is spectacularly scenic '' . The double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gags of Weber and Fields . When a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus , he replied , `` No , it was in the stomach '' . Strangely_enough , this always brought_the_house_down .</context>
