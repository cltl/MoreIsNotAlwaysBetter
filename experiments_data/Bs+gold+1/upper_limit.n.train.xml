      <context> Since the Supreme_Court 's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little_Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old_South . Belief in the traditional way_of_life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones . Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South_Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North_Carolina , and Alabama following along after them . Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; so_that a line running down the length of the South marking the <head>upper_limits</head> of tidewater would roughly divide the Old_South from the new , but with , of_course , important minority enclaves . The long settled areas of states like Virginia and South_Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater . Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such_as the coastal lowlands centering_on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West_Indies than with the North even after independence . The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area .</context>

      <context> The argon flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between **f . and **f . The lower_limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow_rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable . The <head>upper_limit</head> was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc . This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously . For each mass flow_rate the arc voltage was measured . To measure the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scanned with a pyrometer .</context>

      <context> A system had_to be used which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time . A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure . By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular_weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an atmosphere . The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the <head>upper_limit</head> of the apparatus on_hand . The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular_weights which were stated to be 520 and 300 . These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular_weight . The maximum suction was 3.25 '' of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids .</context>
