      <context> Off_and_on , all day , someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything . The evaporative_cooler had been moved to Granny 's room , and her door was kept shut ; so that the rest of the house stayed open , though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way . The dust clogged their throats , and the heat parched them , so that the women were always making ice_water . They had cleaned_up an old ice_box and begun to buy fifty <head>pound</head> blocks of ice in town , as the electric_refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there . One afternoon , as the women sat clucking softly , a new carload of people pulled_up at the gate . It was a Cadillac , black grayed with the dust of the road , its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of_it would be cool and unwrinkled . They were an old fat couple ( as Linda_Kay described them to herself ) , a thick middle-aged man , and a girl about ten or twelve .</context>
