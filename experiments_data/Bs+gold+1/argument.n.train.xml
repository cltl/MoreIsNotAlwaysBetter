      <context> Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience . Bobby_Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil_Hodges turned_the_trick in Brooklyn 's Ebbetts_Field . Ed_Delahanty and Chuck_Klein of the Phillies , the Braves ' Joe_Adcock , Lou_Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat_Seerey of the White_Sox and Rocky_Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on_the_road . Willie 's big day revived the running <head>argument</head> about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey_Mantle . This is an issue which boils_down to a matter of opinion , depending_on whether you 're an American or National fan and anti or pro Yankee . The record_books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace . In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as_many_as 25 home_runs and stole as_many_as 25 bases .</context>

      <context> This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition . If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the right to say anything at_all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian . Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus_Christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind - sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus - then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid . This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the <head>argument</head> of this concluding chapter . Modern man , as Dietrich_Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come_of_age '' ; and though this process by_no_means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in_fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it . In_any_event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at_all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen_fit to place us . To say this , of_course , is to take_up a position on one side of a controversy going_on now for some two hundred years , or , at_any_rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought .</context>

      <context> If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' is clearly untenable . Whereas Bultmann 's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl_Barth , involves the rejection or at_least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered . It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this <head>argument</head> at greater length . We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . To do this , it is sufficient to point_out that if the principle in_terms_of which alternatives are to be conceived is such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question . Thus , if what is at_issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either case the judgment in_question is false .</context>

      <context> If Bultmann 's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant . Nor is it necessary to look_for such evidence in the great urban_centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated . On_the_contrary , even in the heart of `` the Bible_belt '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological_revolutions have long been under_way , together with the corresponding changes in man 's picture of himself and his world . In_fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann 's <head>argument</head> is disclosed . Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence . This is especially in_evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle_class . Time_and_again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern_world are only_too painfully obvious .</context>

      <context> If we look_at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev 's nightmarish worries - or , at_least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage . The other charge was that America 's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years . The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world_affairs can quarrel with it . The <head>argument</head> was typically advanced in_terms_of U._S. `` prestige '' . Prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ; and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading . Prestige is a measure of how other people think_of you , well or ill . But contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake .</context>

      <context> His feeling always exacted sacrifices from her . One is so accustomed to think_of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and women as submissive and yielding , that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned , and we condemn the woman as a coquette . The very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts ; usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived_notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly . She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in <head>argument</head> over a man . Women themselves have come to look_upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld . She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done . One who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger .</context>

      <context> And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging_to the pain itself . The pain in itself was neutral ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no grounds at_all , took_up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for_the_first_time , and in the only intelligible sense , bad . This way of escape is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so_far_as I know , been urged by positivists , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it . I come now to a third <head>argument</head> , which again is very simple . When we come_upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling . But suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again . And suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in_the_first_place has faded .</context>

      <context> Indeed we should say , on_the_contrary , that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal 's pain , that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not . If so , then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only . We are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it . The first <head>argument</head> is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference . It removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this , whereas on positivist grounds it should be . The second argument applies the method in the reverse way . It ideally removes the past event , and shows that this would render false what we mean to say , whereas on positivist grounds it should not .</context>

      <context> Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line_of_work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation requiring a great_deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour . It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more_than the foregoing facts [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , - that_is , from one end to the other - was unimpaired '' . If the <head>argument</head> is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense_of_touch can be explained by his defective visual condition . But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at_hand . In what ways , then , did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself ? He could not see objects as unified , self-contained , and organized figures , as a person does with normal vision .</context>

      <context> was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree . Though Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious_belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown . Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central_city would be likely to destroy this preference - and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians , is actually upon us . In their book American_Skyline , Christopher_Tunnard and Henry_Hope_Reed argue that Franklin_Roosevelt 's New_Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility - a fine ironical <head>argument</head> , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote . The first superhighways - New_York 's Henry_Hudson and Chicago 's Lake_Shore , San_Francisco 's Bay_Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania_Turnpike - were built as part of the federal works_program which was going_to cure the depression . At_the_same_time , Roosevelt 's Federal_Housing_Administration , coupled with Henry_Morgenthau 's cheap-money policy , permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes . Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U._S. government ; householders who had been unable to pick_up the burden of short-term high interest mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per_cent , under government aegis .</context>
