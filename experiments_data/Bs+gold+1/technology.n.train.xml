      <context> Constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor_unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world_courts , and the veto power in world_councils are but a_few examples . Most_of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it . The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme . Just as present <head>technology</head> had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding . We are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very_much at the mercy of man . In_fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day_by_day increasing our fear of each other . I want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear .</context>

      <context> And I would further note that they all - with one exception again - sang in one key or another the same song . Its refrain was : `` Let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation '' . Adlai_Stevenson expressed some reservations about this return . Others invoked <head>technology</head> and common_sense . Only Walter_Lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most_of what we used_to regard_as the program of our national purposes '' . But the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent . The second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower 's Commission_on_National_Goals , titled Goals_For_Americans .</context>

      <context> As I have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known_as the Buy American Act . I urge once_again that the Congress not reenact this rider . The task of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without endangering other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress . The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military <head>technology</head> in history . Some weapons_systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development . Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon_system , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems . This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons_systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_systems which have been overtaken by events .</context>
