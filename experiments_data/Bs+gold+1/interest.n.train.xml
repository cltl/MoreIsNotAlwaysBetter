      <context> The Fulton_County_Grand_Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary_election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took_place . The jury further said in term end presentments that the City_Executive_Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City_of_Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . The September October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior_Court_Judge_Durwood_Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate_Ivan_Allen_Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread <head>interest</head> in the election , the number of voters and the size of_this city '' . The jury said it did find that many_of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . The grand_jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton_County purchasing_departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' .</context>

      <context> The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came_out the best . There were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very_much to do as clergyman . Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public_press of mid Victorian England . There was so much <head>interest</head> shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on B.B.C. , where comments were equally made by an Anglican parson , a Free_Church minister and a Catholic priest . Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television_programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen . A notable example of this was the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool , Dr._Heenan , and the Anglican Archbishop of York , Dr._Ramsey , recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury . The good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well_known in England .</context>

      <context> Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site . Most park planners look_to water frontage for basic park areas . This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water_sports . A body_of_water is usually the center of <head>interest</head> at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use . It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wildlife . The amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important . A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use .</context>

      <context> Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality . This last point is important because if high_school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational_program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears . Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in_fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore '' for those whose <head>interest</head> in their studies has begun to falter .

The reason is that there is a lack of <head>interest</head> on the part of the community . Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high_school described in my first report .

      <context> In both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half . He receives remuneration for his work .

Adult_education courses , work-study_programs of various sorts - these are all evidence of a continuing <head>interest</head> of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth .

      <context> A smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people , he was bound to go_far . Joseph_Jastrow , the younger son of the distinguished rabbi , Marcus_Jastrow , was a friendly , round-faced fellow with a little mustache , whose field was psychology , and who was also a punster and a jolly tease . His father was a good friend of Rabbi_Szold , and Joe lived with the Szolds for_a_while . Both these youths , who greatly admired Henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring Friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine ; and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her <head>interest</head> with Papa , whose mind - although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it - naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were . Besides , Miss_Henrietta - as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back - had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; so Cyrus_Adler became interested in her friend Racie_Friedenwald , and Joe_Jastrow - the only young_man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta , and signed himself Joe - fell_in_love with pretty sister Rachel . Henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe 's older and more serious brother , Morris , who was just_about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa , when he substituted for Rabbi_Jastrow at Rodeph_Shalom_Temple there during its Rabbi 's absence in Europe . Young Morris , who , while attending the University_of_Pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write Henrietta twenty page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of Sarah_Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` Sulamith '' on the Jewish reform_movement being promulgated by the Hebrew_Union_College in Cincinnati .</context>

Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic <head>interest</head> but of no visible significance in practical affairs . The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic ' esthetics ' , which usually turns_out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried_over from European languages .

      <context> On_the_one_hand , the major European_nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience . But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard_to most_of the rest of the world . Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere . Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin_America ( though limited in Latin_America by the special <head>interest</head> of the United_States as expressed in the Monroe_Doctrine , itself from the outset related_to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance_of_power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in_order to preserve both common economic_values and the European `` balance '' itself . A nation such_as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied_upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin_American countries ; out_of_the_question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa . This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19_th century scholars . More emphasis was put upon the fact that international_law was the law of `` civilized nations '' ; Kent and Story , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made_use_of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent .</context>

      <context> Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ_Church and Regius_Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance_English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . But to return to the main line of our inquiry . It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with <head>interest</head> do not even know that its author was a martyr . Utopia is still widely read because in_a_sense More stood on the margin of modernity . And if he did stand on the margins of modernity , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom . It was not even in writing Latin epigrams , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics , or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus 's philological study of the New_Testament .</context>

      <context> Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century . Had More 's writings been wholly limited to such exercises , they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or_so other authors living in his time , whose works tenuously survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works . More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone - because he wrote Utopia . And the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous <head>interest</head> with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or_so . Only one other contemporary of More 's evokes so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work - Niccolo_Machiavelli and The_Prince . Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response ? Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval , the Renaissance , and the modern .</context>
