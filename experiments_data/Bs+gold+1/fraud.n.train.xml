      <context> Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually . You will come_up with a frightening total . That 's why the FDA , the American_Medical_Association ( AMA ) , and the National_Better_Business_Bureau ( BBB ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $ 610 million or_so paid to medical charlatans annually . The Postmaster_General recently reported that mail_order <head>frauds</head> - among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently - are at the highest level in history . Similarly , the American_Cancer_Society ( ACS ) , the Arthritis_and_Rheumatism_Foundation , and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high . For_example , the BBB has reported it was receiving four_times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as_many complaints compared with two years ago . Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come_up with is only a surface manifestation - turned_up by their inevitably limited policing - of the real loot of the medical racketeer .</context>

      <context> The medical device pirate of today , of_course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear - the gallus snapping hawker of snake_oil and other patent_medicines . His plunder is therefore far higher - running into hundreds of millions . According_to the Food_and_Drug_Administration ( FDA ) , `` Doctor '' Ghadiali , Dr._Albert_Abrams and his clique , and Dr._Wilhelm_Reich - to name three notorious device quacks - succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines . Authorities believe that many_of the Doctor <head>Frauds</head> using these false health gadgets are still in business . Look_at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland . Sarah_Gross , a dress_shop proprietor , paid $ 1020 to a masseur , and Mr._A. , a laborer , paid $ 4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines - the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' . Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually .</context>

      <context> The whole_thing , his manner conveyed , was so far outside the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept_under_the_rug . No_doubt Mrs._Meeker had snubbed him many_a time and he felt no grief over her passing . Even_so , Madden 's dislike of the suave , correct lawyer deepened . It would be all_right with him , he decided , if his investigation of the <head>fraud</head> , with its probable by-product of murder , led to Garth 's door . Motive ? Ten-thousand-dollar bequest . At_first_glance , not much of a motive for a man of his standing ; but for all his air of affluence , who could tell what his private financial picture was ?</context>

      <context> They discussed this possibility . However likely it was , Pauling said , he could n't limit himself to it . He had to look_for other prospects , other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to Johnston came to light . Madden , with his investigation centered_on the <head>fraud</head> , said that tomorrow he would go_to the_Bronx bank through which Mrs._Meeker 's checks to Johnston had cleared . Arthur_Williams had to be located , they agreed . He might have been in collusion with Johnston on the fraud ; he might be Mrs._Meeker 's murderer or have played some part in her death . This was Madden 's suggestion ; the police_chief shook his head over it .</context>

      <context> Her friends and professional associates would sympathize_with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically . If Hal_Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way . There was no such thing as an `` accident '' . Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in_this web of elaborate <head>frauds</head> to cover_up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die . And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony . No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared . Hal felt sorry_for Mary ; he had_a_time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation_dome .</context>
