      <context> When I question them as_to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall_into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things do n't count any_more in the world of to-day . I am naive , they say , to make use of such words . I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? - liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social <head>justice</head> is so great that individual and local liberties as_well_as democratic processes may have to yield before it . This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a President of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme_Court . As for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms . The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one .</context>

      <context> And the law virtually ignored the situation . The judge became ill just as the Colfax_District_Court convened , no substitute was brought_in , no criminal cases heard , only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried , and court adjourned sine_die after sitting a_few days instead_of the usual three weeks . Pels complained : `` Litigants and witnesses were put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact business ; public money spent ; <head>justice</head> delayed ; nothing accomplished , and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute farce '' . Word reached the company that the man behind these depredations was Manuel_Gonzales , a man with many followers , including a number who were kept in line through fear of him . Although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old_man named Asher_Jones , the warrant for his arrest had never been served . On May 19 , a deputy_sheriff 's posse of eight men left Maxwell_City and rode thirty-five miles up the Vermejo where they were joined by Juan_Jose_Martinez .</context>

      <context> Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a_few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . Three weeks later following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill <head>justice</head> on affidavits prepared by the district_attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . Both Cook 's and Russell 's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in_the_end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion .</context>
