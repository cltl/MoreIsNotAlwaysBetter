      <context> They stick_to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it . Treat them right and they 'll make a showing every_month in the year except the frigid ones . Give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they 'll repay your solicitude with beauty . A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful <head>addition</head> to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special . This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocado anywhere in the United_States . It has a great many assets to recommend it and if you have n't made avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should . You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted .</context>

      <context> It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical_reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation_energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free_radicals , as_well_as information on the heat_of_dissociation of the carbon halogen bond . The reaction of chlorine with carbon_tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies . It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid . It should be possible to free carbon_tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to <head>addition</head> of radioactive chlorine . Furthermore , the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain_reaction since the activation_energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high ; also it would be expected that * * f would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for * * f radicals . Contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish , even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents . We are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation_energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon_tetrachloride .</context>
