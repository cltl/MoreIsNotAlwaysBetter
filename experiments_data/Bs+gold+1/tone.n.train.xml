      <context> They come in crisp basket_weaves in natural honey hues , along with lacy open weaves with a lustre finish in natural , white , black and a whole range of colors . In the casual field straws feature wedge_heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles . For added comfort some of the Italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning . The citrus <head>tones</head> popular in clothing are also to be found afoot . Orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac . In a brighter nautical vein is Ile_de_France blue . Contrast trim provides other touches of color .</context>

      <context> About the Pro_Arte 's contribution I am less happy . I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group . From a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro_Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here . The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his <head>tone</head> is pinched and edgy . The twenty-five year old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet . There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is_due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs . Turning_to the more modern versions , Curzon 's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work .</context>

      <context> We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers . Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms . So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting_grounds of `` Uncle_Sam '' ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedoms in <head>tone</head> , color , dance , design , and thought . Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing . In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native_land . The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission .</context>

      <context> `` You do n't have_to watch what you say . Of_course , I would like to go_to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people , but I would want lots of Jewish kids there '' . For most Brooklyn_College students , college is at_once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking_away from the cage of neighborhood and family . Brooklyn_College is unequivocally Jewish in <head>tone</head> , and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing_in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing . However , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents . And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view_as softly and insidiously enveloping . `` As_long_as I 'm home , I 'll never grow_up '' , a nineteen year old boy observed sadly .</context>

      <context> His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence . Beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high_society and low morals , always alone , always despised . In_the_end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care ; virtue is its own and only reward . A similar <head>tone</head> of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of Eric_Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery_stories , Dashiell_Hammett 's The Maltese_Falcon . Sam_Spade joins_forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; but when the bird is found at_last , it turns_out to be a fake . Now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves , who is also the real murderer . For Sam_Spade , neither crime nor virtue pays ; moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two .</context>

      <context> Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant_systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal_systems , including some of the more unusual types . By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no_more of the range of possibilities in tone_systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour_languages . This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with <head>tone</head> . Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist . Papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work . The second need is better field techniques .</context>

      <context> I think you could have heard him a mile away , and he was bursting at every seam with importance . I have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man , and when a very small man is up on a saddle , he 'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there . That 's understandable , and I appreciate the sentiment . As for this rider , I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted , so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes , I can n't say ; but I do know that he gave the day <head>tone</head> and distinction . The last thing in_the_world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone_wall , and this dashing rider made us feel a good_deal sharper and more alert to the situation . We came_down off the wall as if he had toppled all_of us , and we crouched behind it . I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars , but that only proves that a_lot of people talk_about things of which they are deplorably ignorant .</context>

      <context> John closed his eyes and saw once_again the little niche in his mother 's bedroom , where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs . The blue draped Virgin was still there , but no_one knelt before her now . Not even Varnessa ; she , too , prayed only to God . For an instant John longed for the sound of the bells of Noyon-la-Sainte , the touch of his mother 's hand , the lilt of Charles 's voice in the square raftered rooms , his father 's bass <head>tones</head> rumbling to the canons , and the sight of the beloved bishop . But he had_to follow the light . Unless God expected a man to believe the Holy_Scriptures , why had He given them to him ? The white clad trees stood like specters in the February night .</context>

      <context> They neither liked nor disliked the Old_Man . To them he could have been the broken bell in the church_tower which rang before and after Mass , and at noon , and at six each evening - its <head>tone</head> , repetitive , monotonous , never breaking the boredom of the streets . The Old_Man was unimportant . Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen_door in early June ; or the smell of thick tomato_paste - the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour - rising_up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly dotted cheesecloth . Or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street_lights .</context>

      <context> Askington was a kind of goal I set myself ; I had admired him long before I talked to him . It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income . The night we first met , at one of Mrs._Monmouth 's giant parties , he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt ; instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade . This set his <head>tone</head> : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as_well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off 's rent for a year . He was fifteen years older than I - forty four - but full of spring and sparkle . He did n't look_like what I thought_of as an old_man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger . He was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in America ; you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every_month .</context>

      <context> Arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came_by . He was very rude . Arlene had a hard voice , too , this time . The policeman 's eyes rather popped for a second ; but then Arlene got another <head>tone</head> in a hurry , and she said , `` If it was n't for these dear children '' - . The policeman got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind_of politely , `` Now , look_here , lady : I know you got to entertain these kids and all . But this is a public park and it 's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on '' . Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir '' .</context>
