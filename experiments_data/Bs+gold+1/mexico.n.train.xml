      <context> Today it is up_for_grabs . One Latin_American country , Cuba , has become a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast . In some countries the trend has gone further than others : <head>Mexico</head> , Panama , and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism , and there is no country - save the Dominican_Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged - where Castroism and anti Americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause . Only in Europe have our lines remained_firm - and there only on the surface . The strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in England , and even in Germany . What have we to show by_way_of counter successes ?</context>

      <context> I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention . You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment - I certainly do - but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United_States not_only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U._S. - Soviet relations for the foreseeable future . I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr._Jameson_Campaigne has done it well in his new book American_Might_and_Soviet_Myth . Suppose , he says , that the tables_were_turned , and we were in the Soviets ' position : `` There would be more_than 2000 modern Soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in <head>Mexico</head> and the Caribbean . Overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a_few hundred miles of our coast . Half of the population of the U._S. would be needed to work_on arms just to feed the people '' . Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn_on us at the first opportunity .</context>
