      <context> He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday 's opener , and never lagged . Dick_McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don_Rudolph to open the Bear 's attack . After Al_Paschal grounded_out , Jay_Cooke walked and Jim_McDaniel singled <head>home</head> McAuliffe . Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line_drive to left . Jay_Porter drew a base_on_balls to fill the bases but Don_Wert 's smash was knocked_down by Rudolph for the putout . The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil_Shartzer 's glove .</context>

      <context> But these comments are hardly printable . An Alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the Virginia belles : `` They thout I was a saint . I told them some sweet lies and they believed it all . I would tell them I got a letter from <head>home</head> stating that five of my Negroes had run_away and ten of Pappies But I wold say I recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and_then they would lean to me like a sore_eyd kitten to a basin of milk '' . Some of the letters were pungently expressive . An Ohio soldier who , from a comrade just returned from leave , received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister , took pen in hand and delivered himself thus : `` [ Dear Sis ] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy was a runing together all_the_time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no_more yuse .

Humor found many modes of expression . A Texan wrote to a male companion at <head>home</head> : `` What has become of Halda and Laura ? When you see them again give them my love - not best respects now , but love by God '' . William_R._Stillwell , an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the Georgia_Department_of_Archives_and_History , liked to tease his wife in his letters . After he had been away from home about a year he wrote : `` [ Dear Wife ] If I did not write and receive letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married I do n't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar_as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as I am so forgitful '' .</context>

      <context> `` Cuban S._S._R. : Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro held mainland last week , there was at_least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian dominated military base . In_fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment . Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought_home to all_of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from <head>home</head> . Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United_States , violate the Monroe_Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin_American republic . Once the full extent of_this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President_Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone . But the Latin_American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American_Defense_Board .</context>

      <context> Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . This probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment_compensation or a Youth_Conservation_Corps . A maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from <head>home</head> . A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor . Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training . Such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located .</context>

Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . Even while suffering the trip to his <head>home</head> , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . Three weeks later following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district_attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun forcing them to kill him , Cook reported .</context>

      <context> These stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more_and_more dry_goods . If the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar_volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put_in the bank . In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated . No suburban shopping-center branch - not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the <head>home</head> store . Telephone_orders distort the picture : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather_than a central city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminates city sales_tax . The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened .</context>

      <context> But they all said , `` No , your time will come . Enjoy being a bride while you can '' . There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning_House ( where the Albright boys always took their brides , till they could get a house and a farm of their own ) . So when the Big_House filled_up and ran_over , the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own <head>homes</head> . And there was still not anything that Linda_Kay could do . So Linda_Kay gave_up asking , and accepted her reprieve . Without saying so , she was really grateful ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought_of the duties she would have as Bobby_Joe 's wife .</context>
