      <context> For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people . Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes . But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides . We have ample <head>light</head> when the sun sets ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; the range of our voice ignores distance . At what stage are social_sciences then ? Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud .</context>

      <context> `` Yes . If life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability . If there were only darkness , all would be clear . It is because there is not_only darkness but also <head>light</head> that our situation becomes inexplicable . Take Augustine 's doctrine of grace given and grace withheld : have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology ? Two thieves are crucified with Christ , one saved and the other damned . How can we make sense of this division ?</context>

      <context> the crude sketch of Piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of , for_instance , Naphta and Leverku^hn . In method as_well_as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism '' , anticipates a kind of musical_composition , as_well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as Leverku^hn says , `` there shall be nothing unthematic '' . It resembles , too , pictures such_as Du^rer and Bruegel did , in which all that looks at_first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for_example , or a deadly_sin . `` Gladius_Dei '' ( 1902 ) resembles `` The_Way_to_the_Churchyard '' in its representation of a conflict between <head>light</head> and dark , between `` Life '' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict . The monk Savonarola , brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn_of_the_century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art shop of M._Bluthenzweig ; in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according_to gossip , upon the painter 's mistress . Hieronymus , like Piepsam , makes his protest quite in_vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating ; he is simply thrown_out of the shop by the porter . On the street outside , Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence , and prophetically he issues his curse : `` Gladius_Dei super terram cito et velociter '' .</context>

      <context> If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must conform_to the changing character and missions of the active forces . Quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers . Under modern conditions , this is especially true of the ready reserve . I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in_relation_to those of the active forces and in the <head>light</head> of the changing requirements of modern warfare . Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army_Reserve . Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National_Guard contained in the 1960 Department_of_Defense Appropriation_Act should likewise be dropped . I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity .</context>

      <context> The blue draped Virgin was still there , but no_one knelt before her now . Not even Varnessa ; she , too , prayed only to God . For an instant John longed for the sound of the bells of Noyon-la-Sainte , the touch of his mother 's hand , the lilt of Charles 's voice in the square raftered rooms , his father 's bass tones rumbling to the canons , and the sight of the beloved bishop . But he had_to follow the <head>light</head> . Unless God expected a man to believe the Holy_Scriptures , why had He given them to him ? The white clad trees stood like specters in the February night . Snow buried the streets and covered the slanting rooftops , as John trudged toward St._Peter 's .</context>

      <context> `` You 're back there riding with the guerrillas , the Moccasin_Rangers '' . `` Hush '' , said Uncle_Randolph , smiling , `` or I 'll give you another black_eye '' . He patted the eye Joel had had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads some days back . Kate had no idea what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue <head>lights</head> and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night , had heard horsemen on the River_Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn . Stranger , Uncle_Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle , drunkenly singing `` Old_Dan_Tucker '' at the top of his voice . Hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road , Kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house , cold_sober . What he was_about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by General_McClellan , threatening reprisals against Rebel guerrillas .</context>

      <context> He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college . He loved them . It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known . Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his handicap , his irons , his stance , his opponents , and his weather in_detail , but the green of the links seemed faded in the <head>light</head> of his business worries . His money was tied_up in a Nassau hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been running against him . His worries harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window . In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves .</context>

      <context> She signed the letters quickly , stamped them , and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town . Then she went_back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water . `` My nephews will be coming_down '' , she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining_room , the whole meal on a vast linen covered tray . She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years ; from the early evening <head>lights</head> of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had faded to a near absence of color which had , possibly from her constant looking_at the water , something of the light of the sea in them . Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew_off the cloth . She smiled , and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face . `` That will be so nice for you , Mrs._Packard '' , she said .</context>

      <context> She was the last living of the older generation . What had once been a widespread family - at one time , she knew , there were enough Packards to populate an entire county - had now narrowed_down to the two boys , Abel and Mark . She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans . What hope lay_in the nephews , she asked the intensifying <head>light</head> out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sired two girl children , with none to bear_on the Packard name ? She ate . It seemed to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table 's empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows . Here , too , she talked low , quirking her head at one or another of the places , most often at Izaak 's armchair which faced her across the long table .</context>

Madden , with his investigation centered_on the fraud , said that tomorrow he would go_to the_Bronx bank through which Mrs._Meeker 's checks to Johnston had cleared .
