      <context> The department apparently intends to make the Rural_Roads_Authority a revolving_fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid_off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov._Marvin_Griffin . The Highway_Department source told The_Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds . Schley_County_Rep._B._D._Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body 's action of Friday in voting itself a $ 10 per day <head>increase</head> in expense allowances . Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought . While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked_out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set_aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87 - 31 . A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29 - 5 .</context>

      <context> `` When you pile your '' guy `` on the bonfire tomorrow night , I wonder how much of the true story of Guy_Fawkes you will remember ? In the 355 years since the first Guy_Fawkes_Night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a reminder '' . The article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill King_James_/1_1 , . In_spite_of the <head>increase</head> in numbers and prestige brought_about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840 's and 1850 's , the Catholic segment of England one_hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per_cent , or 800000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public . The return of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked_upon with indignant disapprobation and , in_fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty . In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in_order_to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers . Now , in 1961 , the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per_cent , or 5 million ) ; yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .</context>

      <context> I again proposed a reduction in the Army National_Guard and Army_Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal_year 1961 . These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives . - About 30 % of the expenditures for the Department_of_Defense in 1961 are for military_personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel . These expenditures are estimated to be $ 12.1 billion , an <head>increase</head> of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social_security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) . Retired pay costs are increased by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel . These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $ 56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army_Reserve components during 1961 . Traditionally , rates_of_pay for retired military_personnel have been proportionate to current rates_of_pay for active personnel .</context>

      <context> The use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really radiates as a black_body , will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material . The radio_radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal_emission at centimeter wave_lengths , except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio_noise . The quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar_radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1 ` K . At meter wave_lengths and <head>increase</head> of the order of 10 ` K in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected . Therefore , neglecting the extreme outbursts , reflected solar_radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter - and decimeter wave-length range . Radio_observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave_lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm , and the results are summarized in Table 1 . Observations have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques ( Sinton , 1955 , 1956 , ; see_also chap. 11 ) .</context>

      <context> These were located at the homes of Government employees , in Government_Offices , buildings and reservations within the trial area . A rough attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first , ninth , and fifteenth floors of a Government_office building . All samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours . In this instance , there was a dosage of 562 during the first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four hour period , a four-fold <head>increase</head> . This suggests that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant locations , should have been increased . As can be seen from Figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this aerosol . The maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source .</context>

      <context> The African rock_python , a close second , is followed in_turn by the reticulate python . There are few data on the boa_constrictor , those for the anaconda are unconvincing , and there is nothing at_all on the amethystine_python . It seems likely that the Indian_python comes_out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently ; it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep . I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; at_best the annual <head>increase</head> appears to be a matter of inches rather_than feet . Until better records have been kept over longer periods_of_time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions , it will be wise to refrain_from drawing conclusions . It is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity , but this apparently is an overestimation . The best way to determine the correct figure ( in captives ) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth , a method that produced surprising results : maturing of a male Indian_python in less_than two years , his mate in less_than three ; data on the boa_constrictor about match this .</context>

      <context> Some vocational training_schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes_Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home_economics . Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . The George-Barden_Act of 1946 raised the previous <head>increases</head> in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in_addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith_Act . The Health_Amendment_Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical_nurse training . The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National_Defense_Education_Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden_Act . Annual authorizations of $ 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians .</context>
