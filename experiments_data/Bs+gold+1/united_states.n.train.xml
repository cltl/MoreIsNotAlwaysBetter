      <context> `` Only a discontinuity can end it '' , Professor_Morrison writes . `` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' . Morrison points_out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet_Union or Red_China , it is the most vulnerable of the great_powers - Europe of_course must be written_off out_of_hand . He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the <head>United_States</head> is the least risky path our government can take . His proposal is opposed to that of Richard_Nixon , Governor_Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic_Energy_Commission , Dr._Edward_Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold_war . These gentlemen are calling_for a resumption of testing - in the atmosphere - on the greatest possible scale , all in_the_name_of national security . Escalation is their first love and their last ; they will be faithful unto death .</context>

The biggest nuclear device the <head>United_States</head> has exploded measured some 15 megatons , although our B-52s are said to be carrying two 20 - megaton_bombs apiece . Some time ago , however , Mr._Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the Soviet_Union would make them . He seems to have at_least a_few 30 - and 50 - megaton_bombs on_hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock . And now , of_course , the hue_and_cry for counter escalation is being raised on our side .</context>

He set_out on his 700 - mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward the <head>United_States</head> .

Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be .

The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the <head>United_States</head> is weaker than the Soviet_Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead . This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human_beings typically do - namely , by taking steps to end_up on what appears to be the winning side .

This group is secularist and their program tends to be technological . But it is the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as symptom of the common_man 's malaise . And let me add Murray 's new book as another symptom of_it , particularly so in_view_of the attention Time magazine gave it when it came_out recently .</context>

      <context> He points_out that from the time of Jackson on through World_War_1 , , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America . He terms this early enthusiasm `` Romantic_Christianity '' and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of_that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical Protestantism '' . Let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme . He says : `` Beside the Protestant philosophy of Progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the <head>United_States</head> to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy '' . He specifies , `` In the middle period of the Nineteenth Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism , in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism . But in every period it has been humanism '' . And let me add , utopianism , also .</context>

In_fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment . Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought_home to all_of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home . Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the <head>United_States</head> , violate the Monroe_Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin_American republic . Once the full extent of_this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President_Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone .

      <context> The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in_terms_of the particle parameters is very uncertain . Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities . However , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship . In the <head>United_States</head> , most_of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces . The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor .

They quote about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater .</context>

Only the amethystine_python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity of data . The following information on snakes varying greatly in size ( but all with less_than a 10 - foot maximum ) shows , when considered with the foregoing , that there is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature . Oliver , in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the <head>United_States</head> , could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in_addition_to the rattlers , which I shall consider separately . These three were much alike : lined_snake ( Tropidoclonion ) , one year and nine months ; red-bellied_snake ( Storeria ) , two years ; cottonmouth ( Ancistrodon ) , two years . Klauber investigated the rattlesnakes carefully himself and also summarized what others have found . He concluded that in the southern species , which are rapidly growing types , females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three .</context>

Other herpetologists have ascertained that in the northern <head>United_States</head> the prairie_rattlesnake may_not give first birth until it is four or even five years old , and that the young may be_born every_other year , rather_than annually . Carpenter 's study showed that female common garter and ribbon_snakes of Michigan mature at about the age of two . Oversized monsters are never brought home either alive or preserved , and field measurements are obviously open_to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimensions . Measurements of skins are of little value ; every snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer .</context>

      <context> It should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone . Land_reform programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture . Lastly , governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead . By holding_out prospects for external capital assistance , the <head>United_States</head> can provide strong incentives to prepare_for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth . At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India , Brazil , the Philippines , and Taiwan , which are ready and committed to move_into the stage of self-sustaining growth . They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups . But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies .</context>

      <context> National_leaders will have_to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men 's sense of identity . Feelings of a community of interest will have_to be recreated - in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for_the_first_time - on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past . Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing_through this stage can be escaped . The <head>United_States</head> can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face . At_the_same_time , we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts . It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing_up to the intractable tasks at_home .</context>

      <context> The codes are mechanism for training in , and directing and enforcing , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group . Durkheim noted long_ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things - unite [ s ] into one single moral community - all those who adhere to them '' . His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit . This is brought_out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the <head>United_States</head> ; and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds . The unifying effect of religion is also brought_out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more_or_less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized . The Jews for 2500 years have been a prime example , though the adherents of any world or inter people religion are cases_in_point . it might be pointed_out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings - political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic .</context>

      <context> Religion is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation . The value-system of a community or society is always correlated with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more_or_less shared system of religious_beliefs and convictions . The religion supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values . Even in the <head>united_states</head> , with its freedom of religious_belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values . This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value_orientation elsewhere ; for_example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism . In America also all_of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common religion . Even the non church_members - the freewheelers , marginal religionists and_so_on - have the values of Christian civilization internalized in them .</context>

      <context> On_the_one_hand , the major European_nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience . But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard_to most_of the rest of the world . Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere . Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin_America ( though limited in Latin_America by the special interest of the <head>United_States</head> as expressed in the Monroe_Doctrine , itself from the outset related_to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance_of_power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in_order to preserve both common economic_values and the European `` balance '' itself . A nation such_as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied_upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin_American countries ; out_of_the_question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa . This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19_th century scholars . More emphasis was put upon the fact that international_law was the law of `` civilized nations '' ; Kent and Story , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made_use_of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent .</context>
