      <context> `` You 're wrong '' , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules . `` I 'll do as you say , but I 'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . The golfing fathers ruled_in his <head>favor</head> . So he picked_up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . Until a_few weeks ago , however , Arnold_Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in_common with the duffers . But after that 12 at Los_Angeles he became one_of_the_boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before .</context>

      <context> Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing - and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them . One wife , described by a New_York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual_relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday night neighborhood card parties . Another put sex on a dollars and cents basis . After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband 's overtures until the matter was settled in her <head>favor</head> . Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed . The wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart_as_a_whip - often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage . She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband .</context>

      <context> Strategy and tactics of the U._S. military_forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history . The change of emphasis from conventional type to missile type warfare must be made with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in <head>favor</head> of the other .

      <context> `` Before God , Captain , I am innocent '' . And though it was logical that a man who could plot mass_murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth , still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for Cromwell . The boatswain was as guilty as any . No action of his could be interpreted in his <head>favor</head> and four midshipmen , prior to their knowing the significance of the Greek paper , had seen it in Cromwell 's hands while Spencer whispered explanations . `` I thought '' , Midshipman_Rogers had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry '' . It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles to the wardroom , where a class of apprentices awaited him . This was a training_ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which Alexander recognized .</context>
