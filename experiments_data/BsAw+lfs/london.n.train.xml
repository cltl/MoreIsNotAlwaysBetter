      <context> The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy . The twenty-five year old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet . There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is_due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs . Turning_to the more modern versions , Curzon 's ( <head>London</head> ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work . Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought_out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout . Some of Curzon 's playing strikes me as finicky , however . Why , for_example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ?</context>

      <context> Here I do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion . I mean something more like Freud 's concept of the utility of `` play '' to a small child : he plays `` house '' or `` doctor '' or `` fireman '' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control . There is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time . In B._M._Spinley 's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of <head>London</head> , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience . Perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation . Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean . It is at_least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as_well_as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature .</context>
