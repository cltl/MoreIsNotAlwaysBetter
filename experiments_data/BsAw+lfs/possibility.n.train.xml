      <context> For we have said , in_effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative . If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' is clearly untenable . Whereas Bultmann 's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl_Barth , involves the rejection or at_least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered . It follows , then , provided the <head>possibilities</head> have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . To do this , it is sufficient to point_out that if the principle in_terms_of which alternatives are to be conceived is such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question .</context>

A second point requires more extended comment . It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` right '' , as represented by Barth , rests_on the following thesis : The only tenable alternative to Bultmann 's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at_least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus_Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann 's point_of_view , are mythological .</context>

This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in_practice , antithetical to these conditions ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization . Moreover , as Communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro_rata and the <head>possibility</head> of their restoration becomes increasingly remote .

      <context> The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues . Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , ' 13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , ' 58 ) . Therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial_artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus . If this be true , the <head>possibility</head> exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial_arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema . One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1 , or 2 , . The presence of normally occurring bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch , and thereafter by many others . Nakamura ( ' 58 ) , Verloop ( ' 48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ( ' 50 ) , von_Hayek ( ' 53 ) , and Tobin ( ' 52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human_being .</context>

      <context> Verloop ( ' 48 ; ' 49 ) found these shunts in the human_being but was unable to find them in rats . Ellis , Grindlay and Edwards ( ' 52 ) also were unable to find them in rats . Nakamura ( ' 58 ) was unable to demonstrate their existence , either by anatomic or physiologic methods , in dogs . The <head>possibility</head> that the absence or presence of these shunts is species dependent is therefore inferred . Certainly , the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species . It is , however , highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery shunts in certain species , especially the dog . In_conclusion , these findings suggest the need for a comparative physiology , pathology , and histology of mammalian lungs .</context>

      <context> Although the Taylor_Scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items . The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . The two ratings yield a correlation of + .04 , which is not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics . In_theory , compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the <head>possibility</head> that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer . The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken_up later .

In establishing criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself .</context>

Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit_margins related to a productivity increase should be shared . The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity share increases as distinct from a cost raising increase in the basic wage rate . We assume further that the union recognizes the <head>possibility</head> that price level increases may offset wage rate increases , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate . For internal political reasons , the union asks for ( and accepts ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up_to the discretion of the companies of the industry . Changes in the basic wage rate are cost raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices . However , it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude .</context>

      <context> Now , with virtually every writer , not_only was the European origin of public_law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others .

Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed countries . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all <head>possibility</head> of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today .
