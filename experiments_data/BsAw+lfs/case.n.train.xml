      <context> In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . To do this , it is sufficient to point_out that if the principle in_terms_of which alternatives are to be conceived is such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question . Thus , if what is at_issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either <head>case</head> the judgment in_question is false . Hence , if what is in_question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a_little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded . Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on_the_one_hand , by the two at_least apparently self-consistent but mutually_exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on_the_other_hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann .

      <context> One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster_Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more_than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation_Of_Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most <head>cases</head> there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .

      <context> In a mobile society , congregational health depends_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like elements will have_to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .

If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 per_cent of the <head>cases</head> ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact .

Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations . This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking_up the wave_lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social_class nucleus of the congregation .</context>

Adele , like Amy , the youngest of the Marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one . For Rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls - and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones - there was no particular March counterpart ; but both groups were so closely_knit that despite individual differences the family life in both <head>cases</head> was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content - the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian . The Szolds , like the Marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ; and , as in the March home , any young_man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them . This included Mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell_in_love , just as Papa had first fallen_in_love with her Mamma before he chose her ; and when a young_man like Morris_Jastrow had enjoyed the Szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold girls and Mamma . And just as `` Laurie '' Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo_March , who found him immature by her high standards , and_then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy , so Joe_Jastrow , who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns_Hopkins , had_to content himself with her younger sister , pretty Rachel .</context>

      <context> This reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence . A contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , St._Augustine , John_Bunyan , and Thomas_Jefferson , all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great_deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression . In much the same way , we recognize the importance of Shakespeare 's familarity with Plutarch and Montaigne , of Shelley 's study of Plato 's dialogues , and of Coleridge 's enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from Plato to Schelling and William_Godwin , through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of English men_of_letters . We may also recognize <head>cases</head> in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists . English philosopher Samuel_Alexander 's debt to Wordsworth and Meredith is a recent interesting example , as also A._N._Whitehead 's understanding of the English romantics , chiefly Shelley and Wordsworth . Hegel 's profound admiration for the insights of the Greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth century philosophy .

      <context> It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship .

By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that <head>case</head> , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of law '' .</context>

      <context> It has recently become practical to use the radio_emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . The results of present observations of the thermal radio_emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared_emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . Observations of the radio_emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to_a_greater_extent than those using shorter wave_lengths and should in some <head>cases</head> give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . Radio_observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . The observed intensity of the radio_emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave_lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black_body at about 600 ` K . This result suggests a very high_temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black_body merely by coincidence .</context>

Mars has been observed twice at about 3 - cm wave_length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars .

      <context> Such treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating nonspecific staining in several other systems ( Coons , 1958 ) . Schramm and Rottger ( 1959 ) did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant_tissues with fluorescein isocyanate labeled antiserum to tobacco_mosaic_virus . The reason for the failure of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known .

The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a_few thick walled cells in the xylem region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors . A study of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm .

In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled_out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise . Thus , for non negative changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active wage_setter , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence . The presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this <head>case</head> , on the grounds that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously . From this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be_due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model . It is this conclusion that we challenge ; we do so by disproving the presumption on which it is based . It is convenient to assume that the union industry contract is of one year 's duration .</context>

      <context> Wage price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces - no single explanation has been found which applies to all <head>cases</head> . The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage price behavior of a_few very important industries . While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United_States since World_War_2 , . Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here presented .</context>

If we did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred ? On the theory before us , such relief would be groundless , for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at_all , and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved about .</context>

      <context> The positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition . So_far_as I can see , there is only one way_out for the positivist . He holds that goodness and badness lie_in feelings of approval or disapproval . And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this <head>case</head> precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging_to the pain itself . The pain in itself was neutral ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no grounds at_all , took_up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for_the_first_time , and in the only intelligible sense , bad . This way of escape is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so_far_as I know , been urged by positivists , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it .

It has been said of John_Stuart_Mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found_out . This theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind , and this I will do my best to supply .

If there is nothing evil in these things , if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them , why should n't they be greeted with a cheer ?</context>

      <context> The positivist tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion .

      <context> `` No '' , she smiled , `` objected '' . Replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre . It would be hard to find anything more equivocal than : `` I cannot recommend him too highly '' . Another less ambiguous <head>case</head> read as_follows : `` The bearer of_this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction . If you are thinking_of giving him a berth , be sure to make it a wide one '' . In the comedy of indefinite reference , it wit occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence . Ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference .</context>

      <context> `` I'm terribly upset '' , she told a girl-friend . `` I wrote Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I did n't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind - and he seems to have misunderstood me '' . Evidently Bill was another of those men who simply do n't understand women . Another <head>case</head> involves a newspaper reporter who tripped_up a politician . `` Mr._Jones , you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted the contradiction of your original statement . Now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard_to it '' ? Questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician .</context>

      <context> Sort_of remorseless , is n't it ? Still , there it is . Now , you no_doubt regard the preceding as pap ; you 're tooling_around full of gage in your hot_rods , gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like Ubermenschen . In that <head>case</head> , listen to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled_with our joss . A_couple_of years back , I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a `` coffin turn '' . In it was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked_up in Bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a_few pennies in its lap . After a while , we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it .</context>

      <context> Very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers . Eight or ten years ago , a_couple_of French hoods stole a priceless Khmer head from the Musee_Guimet , in Paris , and a week later crawled into the Salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy . Hell 's own amount of chaulmoogra_oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the Blessed_One to forgive their desecration . Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I 'll presently recount a <head>case</head> out of my own personal experience , but , for_the_moment , let 's resume our catalogue . Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead , as a dealer in Khartoum assured me , I am not competent to say . Likewise the ivory Chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance Honan ) ; a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack . The three Indian brass deities , though - Ganessa , Siva , and Krishna - are an altogether different cup_of_tea .</context>
