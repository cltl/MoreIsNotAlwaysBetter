The conversation of the characters creates an <head>atmosphere</head> suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age .

In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created .

The unshielded flux is given in the last column ; these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary_space near the Earth . Of_course , if there is a dust blanket around the Earth , the fluxes in interplanetary_space should be less_than the figures given here . Note that the mass scale is one to two orders_of_magnitude greater than some previously used ; for_example , Jacchia ( 1948 ) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a * * f , zero magnitude meteorite .</context>

      <context> The solar electromagnetic - and corpuscular-radiation_pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a_few microns . Also , it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( Best , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected . A measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of deep sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions ( Pettersson , 1960 ) . Most meteoritic material , by the time it reaches the Earth's_surface , has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the <head>atmosphere</head> . For all meteorites , the average nickel content is about 2.5 per_cent . This is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx . Present data indicate an accretion of about * * f tons per_year over the entire globe , or about * * f .</context>

      <context> Also , planetary gravitational_attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . At one astronomical_unit from the sun ( the Earth 's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about * * f km of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic_energy less than their potential_energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . De_Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the <head>atmosphere</head> under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more_and_more eccentric without changing the semi major_axis . This effect can give_rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth . Since there is a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary_space . There are several possible sources .</context>

Sarason et_al. present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test like situation , and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher .
