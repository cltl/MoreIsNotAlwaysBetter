      <context> As the referee does not have access to television monitors , the video goal judge 's decision in disputed <head>goals</head> is taken as final . In the NHL , goals may only be reviewed in the following situations : puck crossing the goal line completely and before time expired , puck in the net prior to goal frame being dislodged , puck being directed into the net by hand or foot , puck deflected into the net off an official , and puck deflected into the goal by a high stick ( stick above the goal ) by an attacking player . All NHL goals are subject to review , and although most arenas have a video goal judge , often officials in the Situation Room ( also known as the " War Room " ) at the NHL office in Toronto make the final decision .</context>

Traditionally that uniform was almost always all black , unless one of the teams was wearing a very dark jersey in which case the referee would wear another colour of jersey ( usually red ) to distinguish himself from both teams . At the 1994 World Cup finals , new jerseys were introduced that gave officials a choice of burgundy , yellow or white , and at the same time the creation of the Premier League in England saw referees wear green jerseys : both changes were motivated by television considerations .</context>

In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per_cent duty on imports via Hudson's_Bay which were viewed_as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' .

As a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions . Among these questions : Military experts say a tight naval_blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task_forces , each built around an aircraft_carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers .</context>

      <context> The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco . At the central level the scrutin_uninominal_voting_system was selected over some form of the scrutin_de_liste_system , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political_parties . The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections . Although the elections were for local <head>officials</head> , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates . With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly . Both parties and the Ministry_of_the_Interior were busily at_work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance . Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation .</context>

      <context> The sine_qua_non of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure . As the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated_by either party could fairly administer elections . The P.D.I. and later the Popular_Movement protected the Istiqlal 's `` privileged position '' until the fall of Balafrej , and_then the Istiqlal used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the pro U.N.F.P. tendencies of the Ibrahim government . The bulk of the preparation had , of_course , proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry_of_the_Interior , whose <head>officials</head> are barred from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics . Apart from some areas of recurring trouble , like Bani_Mellal , where inexperienced officials had been appointed , there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process . Centrally , however , the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage . The King decided to remove Ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a non-party Council_of_Government under his personal direction .</context>

      <context> There were three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of voters and the registration of candidates . Voter registration began in late November 1959 and continued until early January , 1960 . The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response . Periodic bulletins of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial <head>officials</head> . A goal was fixed , as given in Table 2 , and attention focused_on its fulfillment . The qualifications to vote were kept very simple .

      <context> Man , through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny . The theory did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a Hegelian mystique . It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government . It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of <head>officials</head> who wielded public authority . Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society . To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative_officials and judges - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with . Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society .</context>
