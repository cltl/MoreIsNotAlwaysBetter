      <context> But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status_quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as_a_whole . So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard_to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation 's needs for survival . The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society . Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great <head>stake</head> in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society . Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by_any_means other_than the corporate form , e._g. constructing major airports or dams . Thus , if corporations are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject_to public control and needs . In all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services .</context>

      <context> He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance . He is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem . He must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation_to the whole - when the whole is too_large to grasp . He must think_of others who have a <head>stake</head> in the question and in its answer . Who should be consulted among his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies of the Government ? Which American ambassadors could provide helpful advice ? Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted ?</context>

      <context> The gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him , the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black , the bronze cannon at the ports . The captain 's gig of H.M.S._Mercury was being rowed to H.M.S._Neptune . On shore `` the freed slaves to despotism '' - the town dwellers - watched the ships and waited . The chevaux_de_frise , those sharp <head>stakes</head> and barriers around the fort at the Battery , pointed to a conflict between the town and sea_power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came_in . Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber ; their rock paths led down to the Hudson . Below in the open bay facing Manhattan was Staten_Island , gritty with clam_shells and mud_flats behind which nested farms , cattle barns , and berry thickets . Along Wappinger_Creek in Dutchess_County , past the white church at Fishkill , past Verplanck_'s_Point on the east bank of the Hudson , to the white salt crusted roads of the Long_Island_Rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing_for something explosive to happen .</context>
