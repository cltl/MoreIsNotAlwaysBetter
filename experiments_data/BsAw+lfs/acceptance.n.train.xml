      <context> The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of_this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . In regard_to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of_this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half <head>acceptance</head> of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light_mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on_trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as_well_as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ?</context>

      <context> Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp . The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas_Nelson_Page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So_Red_the_Rose , by Stark_Young . Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark_Young 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower <head>acceptance</head> as something real than has generally been supposed . Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner 's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil_War . It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen_Glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society .</context>

In the over-all process , it is difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each constituent of a built detergent formulation ; and , indeed , there is no_more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active , builder , antiredeposition agent , etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making_up a given commercial organic active .</context>

      <context> If modernization programs are imposed from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulties . Land_reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries . It should be American policy not_only to encourage effective land_reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society . As an isolated policy , land_reform is likely to be politically disruptive ; as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide <head>acceptance</head> . It should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone . Land_reform programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture . Lastly , governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead .</context>

      <context> A phonemic_system can be stated without reference_to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics . And the more complex the morphophonemic_system is in_relation_to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic_system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics - at_least , the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures . The design of orthographies has received much less attention from linguists than the problem deserves . There has been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing <head>acceptance</head> . This seems naive . Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology when designing orthographies . Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs .</context>

      <context> To do so , he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in_detail . In the process , he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult . A_few of his examples are of very great interest , and the whole discussion of some importance for theory . His orthographic recommendations are no simplistic <head>acceptance</head> of phonemics on_the_one_hand or of superficiality on the other . Rather he weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness . He concludes that some changes can made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness , but hesitates to suggest precise graphic devices to effect these changes . I hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu circles .</context>

      <context> Now , with virtually every writer , not_only was the European origin of public_law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others . The European customs on which international_law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states . Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed countries . They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an <head>acceptance</head> of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain .</context>
