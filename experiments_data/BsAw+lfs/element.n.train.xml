When , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual <head>elements</head> of external reality . In doing so science has unquestionably cleared_up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions . There have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful . All this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing .</context>

      <context> In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at_hand - and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation . This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman_Vincent_Peale 's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel . But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most_of the pundits seem to have suspected . However , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at_least among the cultured <head>elements</head> of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace . To_be_sure , when this is pointed_out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from Paul 's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of First_Corinthians . But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indignation ? Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking_about the same thing ?</context>

In_the_end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings . Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric <head>element</head> which must dominate in this score , and he manages at_times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song .

      <context> The `` chase '' as a standard film device probably dates_from The_Great_Train_Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device . The chase in itself is a narrative ; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting - both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not_only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; these films and these sequences are also seeking_out - instinctively or by_design - the peculiarly cinematic <head>elements</head> of narrative . There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . The man was D.W._Griffith .

      <context> This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals . The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter .

      <context> - The deterrent power of our Armed_Forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war . The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers , carrier based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles . The second capability is represented by our deployed ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement . The Strategic_Air_Command is the principal <head>element</head> of our long_range nuclear capability . One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the B-70 , a long range supersonic bomber . This aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic_missile systems , all_of which are scheduled to become available earlier . The first Atlas ICBM 's are now operational , the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar_year , and the first Titan ICBM 's next year .</context>

      <context> We speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules and achieve in_spite_of the lack of direction from the environment . It is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores ( although not significantly lower ) . Possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure . Our conjecture is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child accentuates those <head>elements</head> of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work . When helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation , then , and only then , does such a child attain unusual success . The statistical analyses of achievement in_relation_to anxiety and teaching_methods and the interactions of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4 .

      <context> Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome . I have found , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior . For_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got_up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the end of each session . Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an <head>element</head> of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met . This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard_to the wishes of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy_chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair - in_short , behaving as if I owned her room . Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement .</context>

      <context> The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc. . A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such_as Russian . For English the reduction in size is less striking . This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller <head>elements</head> to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary_entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word . The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file .

The parties were on_the_whole unprepared for elections , while the people were still experiencing post independence let-down and suffering the after_effects of poor harvests in 1957 .

They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held .</context>

      <context> Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response ? Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval , the Renaissance , and the modern . The medieval was the most important to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas_More , the author of Utopia , in some intelligible relation with St._Thomas_More , the martyr . To others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of Christian_Humanism , the Renaissance <head>elements</head> are of primary concern . But here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation ; we want to know why that book has kept_on selling the way it has ; we want_to know what is perennially new about Utopia . What is new about it ?
