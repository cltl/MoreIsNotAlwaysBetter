      <context> This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter . Modern man , as Dietrich_Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come_of_age '' ; and though this process by_no_means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in_fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it . In_any_event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at_all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen_fit to place us . To say this , of_course , is to take_up a position on one side of a controversy going_on now for some two hundred <head>years</head> , or , at_any_rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought . We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at_least , Bultmann . It is to this same tradition that most_of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong .

      <context> That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' . One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite . Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy . The London_Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping_out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one_hundred <head>years</head> . With traditional nationalistic spirit , some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best .

      <context> Now again in 1961 , in England , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity . The Church_Unity_Octave , January 18 - 25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches . Many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 . But it must be readily seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these hundred <head>years</head> as to engender hope , at_least on the Catholic side . For `` the_tide_is_well_on_the_turn '' , as the London_Catholic_weekly_Universe has written . I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal_Newman . As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated country .</context>

      <context> For_example , a writer in a recent number of The_Queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un English '' ' . In this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics , priests and laity , in England , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics , especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good . One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken_place since the mid 19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge_Universities . At Oxford one_hundred <head>years</head> ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 . Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs . Now , not_only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious_orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non_Catholic members of the University . Some Catholic priests lecture there ; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students .</context>

The article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill King_James_/1_1 , . In_spite_of the increase in numbers and prestige brought_about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840 's and 1850 's , the Catholic segment of England one_hundred <head>years</head> ago was a very small one ( four per_cent , or 800000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public . The return of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked_upon with indignant disapprobation and , in_fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty . In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in_order_to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers . Now , in 1961 , the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per_cent , or 5 million ) ; yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .</context>

According_to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church_of_England , the `` total of confirmed members is 9748000 , but only 2887671 are registered on the parochial church_rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church_of_England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' .

While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population_shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going_to church . It should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics ( one paper writes 50 per_cent ) .</context>

      <context> I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group . From a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro_Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here . The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy . The twenty-five <head>year</head> old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet . There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is_due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs . Turning_to the more modern versions , Curzon 's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work . Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought_out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout .</context>

      <context> It must be conceded that his native_land provided Prokofieff with many_of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive : economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology - a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose . Thus in Prokofieff the Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century . That his moods , even in his early <head>years</head> , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it . That he mastered every aspect of his medium according_to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture ; and perhaps of even greater significance - his music is strong 20_th Century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution , based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music . April 10 marked a memorable date in New_York 's musical history - indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United_States .

Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world_premiere of the Love_for_Three_Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third_Piano_Concerto . `` Uncle_Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory <head>years</head> of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden_Twenties '' . We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano_sonatas , chamber_music , gavottes , and marches ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities . We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers . Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms .</context>

      <context> In May , 1803 , Ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy . He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries . Thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` Leiden '' jar by Kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of Volta , and 1801 the voltaic_pile . Ritter proceeded , `` You now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the <head>year</head> 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon . This we might well witness '' . Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not_only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it .

In February 1801 , Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic_battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead . In the following <head>year</head> , 1803 , Oersted , simultaneously with Davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic_battery more_than did salts . Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded_down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' . He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood . The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level .</context>

The <head>years</head> 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek_out the philosophers as he had on his first journey . In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws_of_nature in German and this was issued in French translation ( Paris , 1813 ) under the title Recherches_sur_l_'_identite_des_forces_chimiques_et_electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists . His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated . Chapter 8 , is entitled `` On_Magnetism '' and in it are included such remarks as , `` One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic_forces with the electrical forces .</context>

The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in_charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university .

The following <head>year</head> he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr '' , traveling in Germany , France , and the_Netherlands , meeting the philosophers Schelling , Fichte , and Tieck .

From Go ^ ttingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` The first question asked everywhere is about galvanism .

His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let_alone educate them in a town without even a school . The two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a <head>year</head> , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish . Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum . Oldenburg 's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn_to a wider circle of the town 's learned , such_as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching . From the town surveyor , Hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university_student , some academic subjects .</context>

Discussed below are some of the main things to look_for when you select a part-time farm . Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities . Then if you change jobs you won n't necessarily have_to sell the farm .</context>

      <context> Production may fall far below expectations . Drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops . Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner 's earnings , even into his capital . Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good <head>year</head> . The high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis . Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities . Part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities .</context>

      <context> Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final_Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? Should not everyone have been awakened to_it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard_to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen <head>years</head> and which is still by_no_means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) . Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin . It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe . It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; most_of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War_Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors ' accounts .</context>

      <context> The peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across_the_nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy . In New_York_City in 1958 , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive_device . He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman_Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy . A <head>year</head> later in Albany , N._Y. , a Roman_Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned_Parenthood_Association . Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious_belief and conscience . These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue . It has flared_up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family welfare agencies .</context>

      <context> Thomas_Douglas , fifth Earl of Selkirk , a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red_River of the North . Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , he purchased great blocks of the Company's stock with the view to controlling its policies . Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116000 square_miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . The grant , which stretched southward to Lake_Traverse - the headwaters of the Red - was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that <head>year</head> a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York_Factory on Hudson_Bay .

Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go_to Red_River where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest_Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire . The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 .</context>

Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more_than half the student 's time in those <head>years</head> ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought_to begin earlier . Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality . This last point is important because if high_school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational_program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .</context>

      <context> All this is simple enough , but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before . Each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , Porter 's camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play . The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen . If the change , at_first_sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred <head>years</head> to make an analogous change , and the Italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen . In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as_well_as a mechanical recording device . He did more than that . He revealed the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film .</context>

      <context> There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . The man was D.W._Griffith . When he came to the movies - more_or_less by accident - they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes . In about seven <head>years</head> Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film_maker . Before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film . Not that there had not been attempts , mostly European , to do exactly that .

      <context> Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at_heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short_story . Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature . Thus such great American documentaries as The_River and The_Plow_That_Broke_the_Plains were composed as visual stories rather_than as illustrated lectures . The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early <head>years</head> of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a French magician , Georges_Melies , and an American employee of Edison , Edwin_S._Porter . Of the two , Porter is justly the better_known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first_step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion_picture the intricate , efficient time_machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands . Melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film . One of these is the `` dissolve '' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene .</context>

      <context> Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp . The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas_Nelson_Page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So_Red_the_Rose , by Stark_Young . Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark_Young 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty <head>years</head> ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner 's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil_War . It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen_Glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society .</context>

      <context> Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus_Baldwin_Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy_Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him . Others who wrote_of low characters and low life included Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , creator of the Big_Bear of Arkansas and Tom_Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson_Jones_Hooper , whose character Simon_Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem_Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried_out his will ; and George_Washington_Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut_Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner 's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a_hundred <head>years</head> ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner 's time . Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long established literary precedent . Such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ; nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters . One of the early humorists already mentioned , Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials .</context>

Faulkner 's is not the mind of the apologist which Mr._O'_Donnell implies that it is .

      <context> It would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his family . And , after_all , he has lived comfortably at both Oxford , Mississippi , and Charlottesville , Virginia . The young William_Faulkner in New_Orleans in the 1920 's impressed the novelist Hamilton_Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so . Besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in_addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred <head>years</head> . It is more difficult with Faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge . His own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the South , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation . His denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no_doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the South or have written_about the South .</context>

      <context> Accordingly we may speak_of the Platonism peculiar to Shelley 's poems or the type of Stoicism present in Henley 's `` Invictus '' , and we may find that describing such Platonism or such Stoicism and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise .

In recent <head>years</head> , we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts , although these aspects should be studied in_conjunction_with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the sciences . When these fields are surveyed together , important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact with the fine_arts and even , to some extent , with science . Here we may observe that at_least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian 's research . Let us quote once_more from R._G._Collingwood : `` History is properly concerned with the actions of human_beings .</context>

      <context> The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation_program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social_Security_Act in 1935 . Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78_th_Congress in 1943 passed P._L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure . Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven <head>years</head> after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness .

The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation_program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social_Security_Act in 1935 . Up to this time and for the next eight <head>years</head> , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78_th_Congress in 1943 passed P._L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure . Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) .</context>

Retired pay costs are increased by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel .

      <context> Mars has been observed twice at about 3 - cm wave_length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars . The low intensity of the radiation from Saturn has limited observations , but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin . No attempts to measure the radio_emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small diameters , or low_temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave_lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity . In_spite of this , the very large radio_reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio_emission of most of the planets in a_few <head>years</head> . The study of the radio_emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25 - cm wave_length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 ) . This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25 - cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) . They deduced from their measurements that the radio_emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less_than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared_emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio_emission came about 3 - 1 2 days after Full_Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared_emission , which reaches its maximum at Full_Moon .</context>

      <context> The Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive_force of the impinging solar_radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . The radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size - a 1000 - | m diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million <head>years</head> . Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar corpuscular_radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . Further , the corpuscular_radiation , i.e. , the solar_wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive_force to the gravitational_force . The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi major_axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor_axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun .</context>

It seems clear , from the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions for the 34 girls . Accordingly , if epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche , early and late menarches might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for the 18 girls with `` same schedule '' .</context>

The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies .

The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken_up later .

      <context> We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk_lore of the Greeks . In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original - a new thing . It is not merely a new thing ; it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; most_of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism . But to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five <head>years</head> following the publication of Utopia , when Martin_Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine 's encounter with man . New , indeed , is Luther 's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at . Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in_theory or in_practice .

She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road . Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window .

She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting_to be . She fell_asleep leaning_on her hand , hearing the house creaking as_though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred <head>years</head> , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm . Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers . Then she fell_asleep again as suddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes . She stood_up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming_in or going_out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in_a_moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests .</context>

Forty <head>years</head> ago an English writer , W._L._George , dealt with this subject in Eddies_of_the_Day , and said , as an example , that ' Saint_George for Merry_England ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' Strike frog eating Frenchmen dead '' ' ! `` There was also Gott_strafe_Angleterre '' , Moreland reminded me , `` and Carthago_delenda_est , or if you will , Deus_strafe_Carthage .

      <context> For_example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest F major register up_to a barely audible N minor in four seconds , not skipping , at_the_same_time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist 's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage . We would have preferred , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain_from laughing at this and other spots on the recording , since it mars an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance . As Broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted_down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas , the American theatre is going_through an inexorable renaissance in_that nebulous area known_as `` off-Broadway '' . For the last two <head>years</head> , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee .</context>

THE MUSIC OF BINI_SALFININISTAS , CAPITAL_LP 63711 - R , one of the rare recordings of this titanic , yet unsung , composer . Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov_Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach lay_dormant for so many <head>years</head> , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas passed_through his `` purgatory '' of neglect . But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc_Schlek_, Jr. , a major revival is under_way . As he leads the Neurenschatz_Skolkau_Orchestra , Schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor 's insistence . A major portion of the credit should also go to flautist Haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` Indianapolis '' movement in the Baslot .</context>
