      <context> In this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics , priests and laity , in England , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics , especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good . One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken_place since the mid 19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge_Universities . At Oxford one_hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 . Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical <head>representation</head> in the city to care for their religious needs . Now , not_only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious_orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non_Catholic members of the University . Some Catholic priests lecture there ; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students . Further evidence that Roman_Catholicism enjoys a more favorable_position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to_it in the mass_media of England .</context>

      <context> Accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which I shall call mimesis in_order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) . The word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle . For Plato , `` imitation '' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence . All artistic and mythological <head>representations</head> , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . In Plato 's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers . Presupposed in Plato 's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom . Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level .</context>

The groups are therefore really non comparable in content as_well as in size .

If the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense_of_touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in_independence_of visual <head>representations</head> , at_least in regard_to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on_the_part_of unaided touch is denied by the authors . How , then , do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this ? The authors set_about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient 's ability , tactually , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate objects in space , with his eyes closed ( or turned_away from the object concerned ) . Quite naturally , they make the investigation , first , by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at_all and_then , later , by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to .</context>

      <context> This circumstance in the patient 's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at_hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that_is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . The necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense_of_touch , as_such . We do not arrive_at spatial images by means of the sense_of_touch by itself . ( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual_sensation only by way of visual <head>representations</head> ; that_is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual_space '' . The underlying assumption , of_course , is that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully dependable way , to locate objects in space beyond us , the other senses being decidedly inferior , if_not totally inadequate , in this regard . This is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel . Therefore , if the sense_of_touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary .</context>

      <context> Whenever artists , indeed , turned_to actual <head>representations</head> or molded three-dimensional_figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . At_the_least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life .</context>

      <context> Everywhere within the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; Greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized , and plagued , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors . Further we cannot go , for the Dark_ages deserve their name . Many aspects of civilization were not_yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure . The epic_poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the rise of firm political_units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured <head>representations</head> of men - all these had to await the progress of following decades . What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search . These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces . To interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period .</context>

      <context> Flatness may now monopolize everything , but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn_into illusion itself - at_least an optical if_not , properly_speaking , a pictorial illusion . Depicted , Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal , undepicted kind , but at_the_same_time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind - and it does so , moreover , without depriving the latter of its literalness ; rather , it underpins and reinforces that literalness , re-creates it . Out of_this re-created literalness , the Cubist subject reemerged . For it had turned_out , by a further paradox of Cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of <head>representation</head> or imaging . In the Analytical phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not_only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in_order to preserve it ; they had also had to generalize it - to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as_such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself . In_order to be saved , plasticity had had to be isolated ; and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more_or_less interchangeable and contour obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method , the subject itself became largely unrecognizable .
