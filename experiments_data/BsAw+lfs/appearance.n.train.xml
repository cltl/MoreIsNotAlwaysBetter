      <context> In law , appearance ( from Latin apparere , to <head>appear</head> ) is the coming into court of either of the parties to a lawsuit , and/or the formal act by which a defendant submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court . The defendant in an action in the High Court of England enters his appearance to the writ of summons by delivering , either at the central office of the Supreme Court , or a district registry , a written memorandum either giving his solicitor 's name or stating that he defends in person . He must also give notice to the plaintiff of his appearance , which ought , according to the time limited by the writ , to be within eight days after service ; a defendant may , however , appear any time before judgment .</context>

Bill_Kunkel , Bob_Hartman and Ed_Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West_Palm_Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami_Stadium . The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took_over in the top of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee_Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning <head>appearance</head> , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally .

      <context> A large picnic_area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in_width in_preference_to a long narrow area less_than one_hundred feet wide . This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions . However , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman 's trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit . The values of the site may be affected by the <head>appearance</head> of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there . For_instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might_not . The utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site . - Topography is very important .</context>

      <context> This , of_course , depends_on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive_at a good decision . It is too easy for the inexperienced_person to make a quick judgment of a_few values of the area and base a decision on these alone . Usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions . A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in <head>appearance</head> today but have excellent potentials for the future with a_little development or water . The same is true of areas which at_first look good because of a_few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use . In looking_for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others . You need answers to four important questions .</context>

      <context> My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a Jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near Paris . When Beckett 's name came into the discussion , the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett `` hates life '' . That , I thought , is at_least one thing I can find_out when we meet . Beckett 's <head>appearance</head> is rough-hewn Irish . The features of his face are distinct , but not fine . They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel . Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle .</context>

      <context> The wife , Amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` bird like brain '' . La^utner , for his part , `` belonged_to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in_order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so_far not fulfilled : `` They will be destroyed '' . The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as_well . His <head>appearance</head> as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other_than abasement and humiliation . At_the_same_time the multiple transvestitism involved - the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby - touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby 's , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life . The music which La^utner has composed for this episode is for_the_most_part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' . But it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice '' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art '' .</context>

      <context> We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism . Accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which I shall call mimesis in_order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) . The word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle . For Plato , `` imitation '' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical <head>appearance</head> , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence . All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . In Plato 's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers . Presupposed in Plato 's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom .</context>

      <context> After only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree '' , to_be_sure . There were more indications by the mid twentieth century . I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but I noticed several a_few years ago , during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg . In town after town my companion pointed_out the Negro school and the White school , and in every instance the former made a better <head>appearance</head> ( it was newer , for_one_thing ) . It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker_T._Washington had been going_on . But with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired . For over a_hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them .</context>

      <context> He again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in_addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties , and that he opposed war in any form . Thereafter he was classified 1_,_-_O . On April 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board . In a periodic review , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1_,_-_A and upheld this classification after a personal <head>appearance</head> by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home . Upon administrative approval of the reclassification , he was ordered to report for induction on June 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so . He was not prosecuted , however , and his case was subsequently reopened , in the light of Sicurella_v._United_States , 348_U._S._385_(_1955_) . He was again reclassified 1_,_-_A by the local board .</context>

But they are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter . Their <head>appearance</head> , next spring , coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants . In the Sacramento valley in California , for_instance , it has been observed that there was not one day 's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins . This must be_due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal . After the male and female andrenas have mated , the cycle is repeated .</context>

      <context> The injured German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head . This resulted in damage to the occipital_lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . In_any_event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` psychically blind '' , while at_the_same_time , apparently , the sense_of_touch remained essentially intact . Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for_example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure_up a memory-picture of the visible <head>appearance</head> of a well-known friend in his absence . This circumstance in the patient 's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at_hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that_is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . The necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense_of_touch , as_such . We do not arrive_at spatial images by means of the sense_of_touch by itself .</context>

      <context> Then he might finally recognize it , apparently by combining the visual blot , actually being seen , with tactual feelings in_the_head or body accompanying the tracing movements . This would mean , it can readily be seen , that , again , for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have_to be repeated because of the absence of visual imagery . As one would surmise , the procedure , however , could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as_to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference . Men , trees , automobiles , houses , and_so_on - objects continually confronted in everyday life - had each its characteristic blot <head>appearance</head> and became easily recognizable , at the very beginning of tracing , by an inference as_to what each was . Dice , for_example , he inferred from black dots on a white surface . He evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects , but their size and the dots gave them away . And the authors give numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient 's part to show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself and how proficient he became at it .</context>
