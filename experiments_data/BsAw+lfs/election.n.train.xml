      <context> The Fulton_County_Grand_Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary_election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took_place . The jury further said in term end presentments that the City_Executive_Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City_of_Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . The September October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior_Court_Judge_Durwood_Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate_Ivan_Allen_Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the <head>election</head> , the number of voters and the size of_this city '' . The jury said it did find that many_of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . The grand_jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton_County purchasing_departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' .</context>

      <context> Mongi_Slim of Tunisia and Frederick_Boland of Ireland were early favorites in_the_running , but France did n't like the former and the Soviet_Union would have none of the latter . With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr._Hammarskjold , U_Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto . What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy . In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over <head>election</head> procedures , the complicated numbers_game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat . He has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future . He is a Buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not_only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung . U_Thant of_course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when Mr._Hammarskjold 's term would have come to an end .</context>

Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey_Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had - and this was limited to a_few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together - Roy developed his art by himself . In the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and_then to paint . He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his <head>election</head> to the Academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium . Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique . It has been my privilege to paint with Roy_Mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of Batavia . More_often_than_not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting .</context>

      <context> But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman . For three years , since the liquor territorial conference , Torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated O_'_Banion 's impudent double-crossing . They had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in Cicero . When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April <head>election</head> , Torrio had given O_'_Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $ 20000 a month . In six months O_'_Banion had boosted the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb . These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; once_again O_'_Banion 's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill_will .

      <context> I would agree with this view . But I 'm not here to define conservatism .

One of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last <head>election</head> , I suppose , is that we , the majority , were dissatisfied with Eisenhower conservatism .

      <context> From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results . In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance . In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence , but in a system where there is as_yet no place for the less prominent . Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide , minority parties , such_as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958 , clamor for <head>elections</head> when out of power , but are not at_all certain they wish_to be controlled by popular choice when in power . Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process . The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco . At the central level the scrutin_uninominal_voting_system was selected over some form of the scrutin_de_liste_system , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political_parties .</context>

      <context> New , indeed , is Luther 's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at . Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in_theory or in_practice . Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret <head>elections</head> of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; even houses changed once a decade ; six hours of manual_labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; no private_property , no money ; no sort of pricing at_all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term . Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist . It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that informs those details . What that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history , the one which reached Christianity by_the_way_of Stoicism through the Church_Fathers of Late Antiquity .</context>

      <context> On October 31 , 1859 , John_Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder . For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in_public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 . Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia . Although Rhode_Islanders were preparing for the state <head>elections</head> , they watched John_Brown 's trial with extreme interest . On Wednesday morning , November_2 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fairer trial . The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted . The readers of the Providence_Daily_Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old_Brown '' had a fair trial .</context>

      <context> The editor of the Newport_Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment . In direct_contrast to the other Rhode_Island editors , Samuel_S._Foss of the Woonsocket_Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair . Concerning the sentence , Foss wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John_Brown 's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment , it would be well - well for the country and for Virginia '' . Despite the excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of John_Brown , Rhode_Islanders turned their attention to the state <head>elections</head> . The state had elected Republican candidates in the past two years . There was no_doubt as_to the control the Republican_party exercised throughout the state .
