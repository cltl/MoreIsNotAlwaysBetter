The growing communications needs of this new State can best be met , as they have in other States , through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise . Legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these Government owned systems in Alaska , and its early enactment is desirable .</context>

      <context> Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics . They then point_out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of epidemics , it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated .

Our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target .

      <context> A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation_period of most infectious_diseases . Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such_as large cities . An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an aerosol or cloud of agent over the target_area . This concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of particulate biological materials , the pathogenesis of respiratory infections , the medical management of such diseases and <head>defense</head> against their occurrence . The biological and physical_properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years . Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics . Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assessment techniques .</context>

      <context> This area is highly susceptible to infection . The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intra tissue inoculation . The relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in Table 1 . In considering BW <head>defense</head> , it must be recognized that a number of critical meteorological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect . For_example , bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air . There are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne .

      <context> Although the Taylor_Scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items . The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . The two ratings yield a correlation of + .04 , which is not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics . In_theory , compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive <head>defenses</head> are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer . The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken_up later . In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress , and the children 's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years . In establishing criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself .</context>
