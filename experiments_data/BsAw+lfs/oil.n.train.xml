      <context> It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's , which would confirm the date he assigns it . But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as_well_as of typography ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 . When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each . ( It makes no real difference that Braque 's collage is on_paper and eked_out in charcoal , while Picasso 's is on canvas and eked_out in <head>oil</head> . ) By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done . But here again , the surface declaring device both overshoots and falls_short_of its aim . For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives_way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief , which gives_way in_turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seems to contain both - or neither .</context>

      <context> Martha picked_up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom .

The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather_than the Hudson_River Valley of his boyhood memories . He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held_on as the sulky 's wheels hit a pothole and came_out with a jolt and went_on . He would cross to Manhattan , to Harlem_Heights , before morning .</context>
