      <context> Related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence . Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter . In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this . Enthusiastically , <head>Americans</head> have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul_Bunyan tales , Abe_Lincoln anecdotes and labor_union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition . Nor have we remembered that in the melting_pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material . Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant .</context>

      <context> Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe . The Pathet_Lao , stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring North Viet_Nam , were supplied by Soviet aircraft . The Royal_Lao_Army , on_the other hand , was paid and equipped with American funds . In six years , U._S. aid had amounted to more_than $ 1.60 for each <head>American</head> - a total of three hundred million dollars . We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world 's giants . Even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine_guns ? To find_out , we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at_least , by the Royal_Lao_Army : from Attopeu , the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast , to Muong_Sing , the City of Lions in the northwest , close to Communist_China ( map , page 250 ) .</context>

      <context> And I select this sentence as its pertinent summation : `` In_essence the drama of his ( Eisenhower 's ) Presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling - thus_far with but limited and precarious success - to give effective voice and force to_that conservatism '' . I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism . It has moved_on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused . Obviously there has been no agreement on what <head>American</head> conservatism is , or rather , what it should be . For it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle began . I saw a piece the other day assailing William_Buckley , author of Man_And_God_At_Yale and publisher of the National_Review , as no conservative at_all , but an old liberal . I would agree with this view .</context>

      <context> A phonemic_system can be stated without reference_to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics . And the more complex the morphophonemic_system is in_relation_to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic_system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics - at_least , the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures . The design of orthographies has received much less attention from linguists than the problem deserves . There has been a tendency on the part of many <head>American</head> linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance . This seems naive . Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology when designing orthographies . Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs .</context>

      <context> In_the_first_place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal_system . One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded_as the law_of_nations . Admiralty_law , the law_merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law_of_Nations and made dependent_on the several national laws . Private international_law ( which <head>Americans</head> call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international_law proper , or , as it is often called , public international_law . States were free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , their own rules as_to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law_merchant , and to enact legislation with regard_to many claims arising on the high_seas . The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in_fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations .</context>

      <context> Historically in America the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered . `` How ya gonna keep ' em down on the farm '' ? was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree . Though <head>Americans</head> usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious_belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown . Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central_city would be likely to destroy this preference - and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians , is actually upon us . In their book American_Skyline , Christopher_Tunnard and Henry_Hope_Reed argue that Franklin_Roosevelt 's New_Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility - a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote . The first superhighways - New_York 's Henry_Hudson and Chicago 's Lake_Shore , San_Francisco 's Bay_Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania_Turnpike - were built as part of the federal works_program which was going_to cure the depression .</context>
