      <context> Pin <head>shackles</head> can be inconvenient to work with , at times , as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss , usually with a split pin or seizing wire . A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut ( hardware ) located alongside the cotter pin . Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation .</context>

      <context> There was good_fortune and there was bad and Philip_Spencer , in handcuffs and ankle irons , knew it to be a truth . He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune .

This tragic lad had forged his own <head>shackles</head> . But he could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him .

      <context> The boatswain was as guilty as any . No action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen , prior to their knowing the significance of the Greek paper , had seen it in Cromwell 's hands while Spencer whispered explanations . `` I thought '' , Midshipman_Rogers had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry '' . It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in <head>shackles</head> to the wardroom , where a class of apprentices awaited him . This was a training_ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which Alexander recognized . Some of these apprentices were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were Spencer 's followers .</context>
