      <context> However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of <head>suit</head> likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' . 353_U._S._,_at_589 .

We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of <head>suit</head> , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints . The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition '' . 353_U._S._,_at_607 .

      <context> My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when '' ; and_others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commencing again her piano_lessons , her private_school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe . In my letters I took_on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real_life . Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after_school class I was enrolled . The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young_man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot_Sands - he of the porch steps anecdotes - who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar <head>suits</head> , and sneaked_off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them . Like Eliot , in my fantasies , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night 's climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love . The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle - it must have been late in September - I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and bloody , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life . For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in_that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie_awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep .</context>

      <context> `` You know who the other man was '' ? `` No , I never did see his face . I did n't get a good look at him at_all , his back was to me , and I was so scared .

What Joyce wanted me to do was go_to Thor 's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes - and handbag containing her identification . She realized I 'd have_to notify the police , but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name .</context>

      <context> And Gratt_Shafer would be in Memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all_along . Like Mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and Toonker_Burkette back in his office yanking out teeth , like they all knew he would . Just like the balloon would go_up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to_hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen . Or you could hope the parachute would n't open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm to Starkey_Poe in his <head>suit</head> of red underwear , but mainly because you were tired_of being an old_maid - a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant , but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go_on like everything is all_right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` I think I 'm pregnant '' . You could wish that . Or you could wish your daddy would really do it - kill Gratt_Shafer like he said when you all_the_time , all_along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night . So you sit in the car and listen to the air run_out and listen to the rain and see the mud in_front_of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator_pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off , because that is being an old_maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help .</context>

      <context> You look_like a tweedy Englishman . Ca n't you wear something else and look a_little more as though you belonged '' ? `` I do n't mind at_all '' , he said , delighted with her attention . Changing his clothes , he put_on his dark-blue flannel <head>suit</head> , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for_good . But it was a hopeful sign , he told himself . She no_longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in Parioli . That day they loafed around , just getting the feel of the city .</context>

      <context> `` If you can fix it up with the undertaker '' , returned the politician , `` it 's all_right with me '' . The manager of a movie_theater received a telephone_call from a woman who was equally indefinite . `` What have you got_on today '' ? she inquired . `` A blue <head>suit</head> '' , he answered . `` Who 's in it '' ? she continued . `` I am '' , he said . There was a short pause for reflection .</context>
