      <context> In analyzing the watercolors of Roy_Mason , the first thing that comes_to_mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate . Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with <head>lights</head> ; a middle_distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey .

Each frame comes between the <head>light</head> and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent_movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second .

Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end - elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence .</context>

      <context> The inner life of congregations will prosper so_long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; the outer life of congregations - the suitability of the environment to their survival - will be propitious so_long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership . Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation . In a rapidly changing society congregations will run_into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more_than a single generation . The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the <head>light</head> of_this struggle to maintain economic balance . The expense of_this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development . It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends - expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings . These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis .</context>

The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed <head>light</head> intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions . Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon_tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data . It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical_reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation_energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free_radicals , as_well_as information on the heat_of_dissociation of the carbon halogen bond . The reaction of chlorine with carbon_tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies .</context>
