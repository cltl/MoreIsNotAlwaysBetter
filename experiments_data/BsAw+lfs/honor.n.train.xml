      <context> The Macmillan government might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable . Who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin ? Who but Nikita himself ? Since he has just shown who is top_dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest <head>honor</head> in the gift of the Soviet people . Besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which , what with exhumations and rehabilitations , seems to match that of life . Suppose he did lie beside Lenin , would it be permanent ? If some future Khrushchev decided to rake_up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory_workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ?</context>

      <context> It must be conceded that his native_land provided Prokofieff with many_of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive : economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology - a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose . Thus in Prokofieff the Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century . That his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him <head>honor</head> , as his music honors those who inspired it . That he mastered every aspect of his medium according_to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture ; and perhaps of even greater significance - his music is strong 20_th Century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution , based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music . April 10 marked a memorable date in New_York 's musical history - indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United_States .

      <context> But even on these , the palette often takes_over while the shotgun cools_off ! Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey_Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had - and this was limited to a_few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together - Roy developed his art by himself . In the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and_then to paint . He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early <head>honors</head> , including his election to the Academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium . Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique . It has been my privilege to paint with Roy_Mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of Batavia . More_often_than_not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting .</context>

      <context> Oddly_enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty . Certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better .

Eighty thousand won top <head>honors</head> and a chance to try_for the team itself . We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people .

He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing_about science . In_this third year at the university , Hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` Limits_of_Poetry_and_Prose '' . He completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high <head>honors</head> in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor_of_Philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine . He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices . Han 's student days were at_a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent . The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in_charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university .</context>

A story , no_doubt apocryphal , for Mercer himself denies it , has him sporting a monocle in those Village days .

Mercer is_supposed_to have refused it with , `` Anyone who wears a square monocle must be affected '' ! Everett_Miller , then assistant director for the Garrick_Gaieties , a Theatre_Guild production , needed a lyricist for a song he had written ; he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however .

      <context> The Providence_Daily_Journal , however , stated that Brown 's courage , bravery , and heroism `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; it gives something of dignity even to a bad one '' . The Woonsocket_Patriot admitted that John_Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no_more be hung than Henry_A._Wise or James_Buchanan '' . The Newport_Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him . In her letter to John_Brown , `` E._B. '' , the Quakeress from Newport , had suggested that the American people owed more <head>honor</head> to John_Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George_Washington . During the latter days of November to the day of Brown 's execution , it seems that most Rhode_Islanders did not concur in `` E._B. 's '' suggestion . On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown 's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions . A week later the Daily_Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John_Brown on the day of his execution .</context>

      <context> Extraordinary precautions were taken so that no stranger be allowed_in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surrounding the scaffold .

The only public demonstration in <head>honor</head> of John_Brown was held at Pratt_'s_Hall in Providence , on the day of his execution . Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt_Hall meeting `` brought_together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many_of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' . Seated on the platform were Amos_C._Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; Thomas_Davis , an uncompromising Garrisonian ; the Reverend_Augustus_Woodbury , a Unitarian minister ; the Reverend_George_T._Day , a Free-Will Baptist ; Daniel_w._Vaughan , and William_H._H._Clements .
