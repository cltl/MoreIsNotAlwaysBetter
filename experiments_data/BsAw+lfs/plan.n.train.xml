The American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course . An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior_design , for_the_most_part schools accredited by membership in the National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art , and a further `` on_the_spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations .

The suggested course of the A.I.D. was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities .

The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex - high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two .

There have been a number of sound <head>plans</head> proposed . But none of these has been implemented .

King_Muhammad /5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections on May_Day , 1957 . There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister_of_the_Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less_than enthusiastic . Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary <head>plan</head> left by the_French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious . From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government . Until the Charter_of_Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes . The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 , but the P.D.I. ( Parti_Democratique_de_l'Independance ) , the most important minor party at the time , objected to the Istiqlal 's predominance in the civil_service and influence in Radio_Maroc .</context>
