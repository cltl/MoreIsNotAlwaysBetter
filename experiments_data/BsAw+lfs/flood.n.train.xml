      <context> These will <head>usually</head> be able to accommodate one or two engineers . In the recent years there have been new developments , and LED technology has come a long way . Now LED flood lights are bright enough to be used for illumination purposes on large sport fields .</context>

      <context> But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly . When East_Germans fled to the West by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists . They are less vocal now , when it is the West_Berliners who are migrating . The <head>flood</head> is not as great - only 700 a week according_to one apparently conservative account - but it is symptomatic . West_Berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable . Nearly 18 per_cent of West_Berlin 's 2200000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12.8 per_cent are under fifteen . R._H._S._Crossman , M.P. , writing in The_Manchester_Guardian , states that departures from West_Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a week .</context>

      <context> In Poughkeepsie , N._Y. , in 1952 , a Roman_Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned_Parenthood_Federation or to resign from the hospital staff . Three agreed , but four declined and were suspended . After a <head>flood</head> of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 . The peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across_the_nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy . In New_York_City in 1958 , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive_device . He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman_Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy .</context>

      <context> In_fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers . There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision . A meteor could fall on San_Francisco . Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of <head>flood</head> or drought . Our understanding of the solar_system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing . Yet we no_longer feel uneasy . This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in_common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war .</context>

      <context> Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud . And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact . Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a <head>flood</head> of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man . Constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor_unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world_courts , and the veto power in world_councils are but a_few examples . Most_of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it . The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .</context>

      <context> weaken Castro . Another strategy - bolder and tougher - was also attracting notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world , destroy Castro . Blockade , in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe_Doctrine . It could halt a <head>flood</head> of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro . It could stop Cuban re export of guns and propaganda materials to South_America . It would be the most severe reprisal , short_of declared war , that the United_States could invoke against Castro . It is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , Members of Congress , officers in the Pentagon .</context>

      <context> He thought_of Simms_Purdew snoring on his bunk while Pullen_James crouched by the hearth , skirmishing an undershirt for lice , and a wet log sizzled . He thought_of Simms_Purdew , who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield , a maniacal scream on his lips , and swung a clubbed musket like a flail to beat down the swirl of Rebel bayonets about him . He thought_of Simms_Purdew rising_up , fearless in glory . He felt the sweetness of pity <head>flood</head> through him , veining his very flesh . Those men , lying in the huts , they did not know . They did not know who they were or know their own worth . In the pity for them his loneliness was gone .</context>

      <context> Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers . Then she fell_asleep again as suddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes . She stood_up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming_in or going_out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in_a_moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests . She went_into the living_room and turned_on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned_on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the <head>floods</head> on the barn , illuminating the driveway . She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself . They were both so young , after_all , so unready for any final parting . How could it have been thirty years already , she wondered ?</context>
