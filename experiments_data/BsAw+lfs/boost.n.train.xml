      <context> The Bears are set to play at Harris_Teachers_College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy , Ill. , Saturday . If it 's true that contented cows give more milk , why should n't happy ball players produce more base_hits ? The two top talents of the time , Mickey_Mantle and Willie_Mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so_far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations . And that 's meant as a <head>boost</head> , not a knock . Mays and Mantle , both 10 - year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they 've never hit the heights . Their heights , that_is . Mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown_season , 1959 , when he batted .365 and also led the American_League in home_runs , 52 , and RBIs , 130 .</context>

      <context> Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean . It is at_least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as_well_as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature . In any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions , particularly with_respect_to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature '' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required . In the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for_example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiments or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the <head>boost</head> to the self-esteem for the semi-literate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy_life regarded_as forbidden , or by half conscious ideas about the magical_power of words ? These are , if the research is done with subtlety and skill , researchable topics , but the research is missing . One of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide . Sensibility is a vague word , covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent , quality , or skill .</context>

      <context> As a strike continues , these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement . They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail . Public indignation and resistance to wage price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3 % per_annum than when the increases are on the order of 3 % per month . The simple passage of an additional eleven months ' time makes the second 3 % <head>boost</head> more acceptable . Thus , the public limit price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase . Notice , however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per_se , without an accompanying wage increase . Similarly , higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase .</context>

      <context> Dear Sirs : Let me begin by clearing_up any possible misconception in your minds , wherever you are . The collective by which I address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in_use among professional thieves . It is , I am reliably given to understand , the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the <head>boost</head> ; i.e. , burglars who rob while the tenants are absent , in contrast to hot slough prowlers , those who work while the occupants are home . Since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior . Far from it ; I merely draw an etymological distinction , hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman . Above_all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence , to whimper over the loss of a_few objets_d'art , or to shame you into rectitude .</context>
