      <context> Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses - architecture versus interior_design - let us examine the educational needs of the interior_designer . To_begin_with , what is an interior_designer ? `` The_Dictionary_of_Occupational_Titles '' published by the U._S. Department_of_Labor describes him as_follows : `` Designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , <head>clubs</head> , ships , theaters , as_well_as set_decorations for motion_picture arts and television . Makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor_coverings , wall decorations , and determines color_schemes . Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval . Makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows_through to completion of project `` .</context>

Have you considered delegating operational responsibility to your employee association and carefully restricting your plant 's financial contribution ?

Are you spending too much money on team uniforms that benefit only a_few employees ? Are you underwriting expensive team trips ?</context>

      <context> Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ? Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls , who will grow_up to enjoy a traditional American way_of_life - ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? Would you like to organize Teen Hunters <head>Clubs</head> , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting_preserves ? Ask Sammy_Shooter . We were camping a_few weeks ago on Cape_Hatteras_Campground in that land of pirates , seagulls and bluefish on North_Carolina 's famed Outer_Banks .

Through the efforts of SAAMI 's shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a_few . The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many_of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it .</context>

That left three , possibly four , one looking much like the next . He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule . He quickly closed it again .</context>
