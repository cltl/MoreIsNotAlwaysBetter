      <context> The record_books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace . In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as_many_as 25 home_runs and stole as_many_as 25 bases . Once the figure was 30 - 30 . Willie 's <head>lifetime</head> batting average of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's . The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick_Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park . It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump .

Two millions were added to what had been set_aside for it in Mrs._Meeker 's <head>lifetime</head> , and the proviso made that as long as Brian_Thayer continued to discharge his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board_of_trustees ( hereinafter appointed by the bank administering the estate ) he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would entail . A splendid vote_of_confidence in Thayer , Madden reflected . Tenure , too . Very nice for him .</context>
