      <context> In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under_way during the first decade . As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share_in the manufacturer 's as_well as the distributor 's profits - which is , in_effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do . Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded . Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain_stores have insisted on high_quality - and the <head>customer</head> seems to have caught_on . If you are up_against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ?

In six months O_'_Banion had boosted the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb .

      <context> Within a_few years various du_Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General_Motors ' eight operating divisions . The Fisher_Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting_trust even though General_Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from du_Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General_Motors divisions . Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General_Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend stemmed `` at_least in part '' from the needs of General_Motors outstripping du_Pont 's capacity . `` The fact that sticks_out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du_Pont 's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one <head>customer</head> in the automobile_industry connected to du_Pont by a stock interest .

      <context> Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision . Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du_Pont and General_Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his <head>customer</head> 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute . We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints .

      <context> Whether or not it is in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends_upon the extent to which the public limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase . The extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase . We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put_up by the industry . The industry may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in_order to `` educate '' the government and the <head>customers</head> of the industry . As a strike continues , these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement . They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail . Public indignation and resistance to wage price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3 % per_annum than when the increases are on the order of 3 % per month .</context>

      <context> The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of GNP . The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest . Because of its importance , and because the lack of price_competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases . The threat of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of endangering relations with <head>customers</head> , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases . For the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry limited price ( but not below average_cost ) . For such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs ( due_to rising wages , etc . ) . Thus , if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate .</context>

      <context> Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act_as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover . When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing . Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easier than to the downtown department_store , though both are the same distance from home . Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls <head>customers</head> who are geographically much nearer to downtown . Raymond_Vernon reports that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the lot next_door . If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened_away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program .</context>
