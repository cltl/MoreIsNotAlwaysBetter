But under the sensus communis we must include the Idea of a communal sense [ eines gemeinschaftlichen Sinnes ] , i.e. of a faculty of judgement , which in its reflection takes account ( a priori ) of the mode of representation of all other men in thought ; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity , and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so easily taken for objective , which would injuriously affect the judgement .</context>

      <context> I should_like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect_to vocational education . First_and_foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic_program for graduation . Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more_than half the student 's time in those years ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought_to begin earlier . Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this <head>sense</head> of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality . This last point is important because if high_school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational_program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears . Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in_fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter .</context>

      <context> He is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped . I have chosen to use the word `` mimesis '' in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the Christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the Greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection . In the first instance , `` mimesis '' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in_terms_of vivid images rather than in_terms_of abstract ideas or conventional designations . By `` image '' is meant not_only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five <head>senses</head> plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith . This is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated . Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself . The images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately ; they are fields_of_force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one_another .</context>

      <context> The images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately ; they are fields_of_force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one_another . They bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality . As in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images . Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional <head>sense</head> . A word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene '' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings . Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field . A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy .</context>

      <context> Primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects ( houses , trees , implements , etc . ) nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory qualities . In_contrast_to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers . The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part . These desires presuppose a <head>sense</head> of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some working for one 's good , others threatening ill . Gone is the tabula_rasa of the mind . In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one 's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught .

      <context> All such imitations of negative quality have given_rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at_least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak_to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved . The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems . Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually_exclusive , that they belong together . Without the decay of a <head>sense</head> of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being . And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written . For better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . A broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcends the non artistic causal_factors out of which it arises .</context>

      <context> It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble , solid , and limited basis . I would propose , first , an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved . I would propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible . There would be no conceivable <head>sense</head> in going_to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable .

      <context> National identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which incorporated this Hegelian abstraction and saw law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection . In the international community this reduced law to Jellinek 's auto_limitation . A state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of self-will , or consent . According_to the new theories , the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was `` sovereign '' in a quite new and different <head>sense</head> from his historical predecessors . He no_longer sought to find the law ; he made it ; he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be .

Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political_system that was central to world politics for a century . International_law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European_nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful <head>sense</head> . Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international_law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political_system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; second , it had to be compatible with the value_system that they shared . In both respects , international_law was Europeanized . It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions .</context>

      <context> So_far_as I can see , there is only one way_out for the positivist . He holds that goodness and badness lie_in feelings of approval or disapproval . And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging_to the pain itself . The pain in itself was neutral ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no grounds at_all , took_up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for_the_first_time , and in the only intelligible <head>sense</head> , bad . This way of escape is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so_far_as I know , been urged by positivists , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it . I come now to a third argument , which again is very simple . When we come_upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling .</context>

Indeed we should say , on_the_contrary , that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal 's pain , that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not .

      <context> It ideally removes the past event , and shows that this would render false what we mean to say , whereas on positivist grounds it should not . Let us suppose that the animal did not in_fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at_all , but that we mistakenly believe it did , and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing . On the positivist theory , everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second . In the only <head>sense</head> in which badness is involved at_all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety , since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling , and that feeling is still there . And our question is , is such an implication consistent with what we meant ? Clearly it is not . If anyone asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at_all , we should say that it made all the difference in_the_world , that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our assertion was in that case mistaken .</context>

      <context> ( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade . Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line_of_work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation requiring a great_deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour . It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more_than the foregoing facts [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary <head>sense</head> of the word , was unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , - that_is , from one end to the other - was unimpaired '' . If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense_of_touch can be explained by his defective visual condition . But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at_hand . In what ways , then , did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself ?</context>

      <context> This circumstance in the patient 's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at_hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that_is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . The necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense_of_touch , as_such . We do not arrive_at spatial images by means of the sense_of_touch by itself . ( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual_sensation only by way of visual representations ; that_is , there is , in the true <head>sense</head> , only a visual_space '' . The underlying assumption , of_course , is that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully dependable way , to locate objects in space beyond us , the other senses being decidedly inferior , if_not totally inadequate , in this regard . This is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel . Therefore , if the sense_of_touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary .</context>

The answer the authors give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance . It is as_follows : `` The usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness ( pressure , pain , temperature ) , as_well_as the kinesthetic sensations ( muscular feelings , feelings in the tendons and joints ) , were , as_such , essentially intact , although they seemed , in_comparison_with normal reactions , to be somewhat diminished over the entire body .

      <context> It was merely an attempt to frighten her . She would n't go_back to New_York as Maude suggested ; she would n't run like a scared cat . But - well , she 'd be very careful . She dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a <head>sense</head> of normal everyday life . But before she left her room she dug_into her big moire bag , took_out the envelope holding her marriage_contract and the wax seal had been broken . So somebody else knew what would happen to her father 's money if she died . Rev had known all_along .</context>

      <context> Without taking_off his coat , he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door . At_last , sitting there , in the familiar surroundings , the truth began to sink_in . Who ? He felt no anger towards Kitti , no <head>sense</head> that she had betrayed him . Who ? She was all he had , everything he had , everything he wanted . Someone had taken her away from him .</context>

      <context> Just put yourself in Felix 's place for a moment . You 're a taxpayer , householder , landlord . You 've been away from home for the New_Year festivities , but now the party is over and you come home . Defining sobriety in the limited <head>sense</head> of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol ingested and not_yet eliminated from the system , you are sober . You still have your paper hat and you 're wearing it , but then , it is an extraordinary paper hat and , in_addition to anything else you may be , you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame out in the back_yard . It 's not too_much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will Mr._Average_Citizen . You have your paper horn clutched in your big , craggy fist , and for your entrance you have planned a noisy , colorful and exuberant greeting to your friends and tenants .</context>

      <context> He thought : Where the hell could he have gone ? How can I find him ? There was no answer to this and he began to pace back_and_forth across the room , his imagination out of control . He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton had sobered_up enough to get some <head>sense</head> . Maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer , whoever he was , in_which_case an unloaded gun would be good_enough . He thought_of other possibilities , none of them satisfactory , and finally he began to think , to wonder if there was some way he could reach Burton . Then , as he turned toward the telephone , it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly .</context>

      <context> He examined the water_marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished . The waters lay muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheels ; there was not a match width of damp mark to show they were receding . He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley . A terrible , numbing <head>sense</head> of futility swept_over him . He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat . Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen . The spokes were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece .</context>
