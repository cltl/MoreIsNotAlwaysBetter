      <context> Early versions <head>were</head> not polarized , but most plugs are polarized today via a taller neutral blade on the plug that fits a wider neutral slot on the receptacle . ( Unpolarized AC adapters are a common exception . ) Ungrounded NEMA-1 outlets are not permitted in new building construction in the United States and Canada , but can still be commonly found in older construction .</context>

      <context> In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under_way during the first decade . As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share_in the manufacturer 's as_well as the distributor 's profits - which is , in_effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do . Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded . Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution <head>outlets</head> and chain_stores have insisted on high_quality - and the customer seems to have caught_on . If you are up_against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ? If private brand competition has n't been felt in your product field as_yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? Display merchandising , backed by pre selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties .</context>

If you have a higher quality product , how can you make it stand_out - justify its premium price - without the spoken word ? Salesmanship is still necessary , but it 's a different brand of salesmanship . Have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ?</context>

      <context> While Mr._Blatz was putting_up the pegboards and starting the workbench , Mr._Crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar . Mr._Blatz agreed that this would be pretty . Without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling , which he then stained and waxed according_to his taste . `` Now '' , he said , `` we got to put_in some <head>outlets</head> for them power_tools ; then a_couple_of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an ' I guess we 're about through down here '' . It all did look very efficient and shipshape .
