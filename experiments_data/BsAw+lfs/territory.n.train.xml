Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons ' aerial thrusts in the late stages . One was on a fourth down screen_pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon 's <head>territory</head> . `` As_soon_as it started to form , Gannon spotted it '' , Meek said . `` He timed it just_right and broke_through there before the boy ( halfback Terry_Isaacson ) had time to turn_around . He really crucified him .</context>

      <context> When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O_'_Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $ 20000 a month . In six months O_'_Banion had boosted the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb . These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; once_again O_'_Banion 's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill_will . The revenue from O_'_Banion 's Cicero <head>territory</head> went_up still higher , until the yield was more_than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago 's South and West_Sides . But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate . At_last , even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O_'_Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in_return for one from his Cicero beer concession . O_'_Banion 's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .</context>

      <context> Although Brooklyn_College does not_yet have a junior year abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in Europe . In_general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard or Smith . And acculturation into the world at_large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn_College student after college rather_than during the four school_years . Brooklyn_College is Marjorie_Morningstar <head>territory</head> , as much_as the_Bronx or Central_Park_West . There are hordes of nubile young_women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry . It is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere - about 30 per_cent of the women and 25 per_cent of the men in the graduating_class - the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed_up the estimate . `` Almost everybody in the senior_class is married '' , students say dogmatically .</context>

      <context> There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto Yokuts . This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very_much larger <head>territory</head> ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; or both . The differentiation however is not very_much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . ( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem / item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . ) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison .</context>

      <context> Whereas , John_Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper : Therefore , Resolved that , while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects , yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor . Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas , occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent_on the propagation of slavery in that <head>territory</head> , call_for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice . Resolved that the anti slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action . Resolved , that we find in this fearful tragedy at Harper_'s_Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible . On the morning following the Pratt_Hall meeting the editor of the Providence_Daily_Journal wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes , it could have been avoided completely .</context>

      <context> Siberia spoke Icelandic . His mind turned the globe swiftly for him , and he visualized Africa , which used Swahili south of the Sahara_Sea . All_around the Mediterranean_Sea , Asia_Minor , northern India , and Tibet , Hebrew was the native tongue . In southern Europe , between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic_speaking peoples of northern Europe , was a thin but long stretch of <head>territory</head> called March . This was no_man's_land , disputed by the Haijac_Union and the Israeli_Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years . Neither nation would give_up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic_War . So , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own borders ) .</context>

The metal strip they had taken_off from was coal_black against the green jungle around it .
