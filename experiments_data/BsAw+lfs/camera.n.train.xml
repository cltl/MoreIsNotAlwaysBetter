      <context> A typical `` sonogram '' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in Fig. 5 . The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc. and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter . The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90 - degree arc in_front_of the eye to `` look_into '' all corners . The total picture is only seen by the <head>camera</head> which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90 - degree rotation period . Drs._Howry and Holmes at the University_of_Colorado_Medical_School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results . By submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes_on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in Fig. 7 , as_well_as many other hitherto impossible insights . As mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig. 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center .</context>

      <context> A high-speed shutter has been developed in_order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion . The shutter consists_of two parts : a fast opening part and a fast closing part . Using Edgerton 's method , the fast closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires . The fast opening of the shutter consists_of a piece of aluminum_foil ( approximately * * f ) placed directly in_front of the camera_lens so that no light may pass into the <head>camera</head> . The opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil . During the discharge the magnetic_forces set_up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center_line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera . Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60 - 80 microseconds .</context>

The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil . Besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength , the spectra of extraterrestrial radio_sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small molecules .</context>

Each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her . He ran on his plump sticks of legs , freezing now_and_again into the sudden startled attitudes which the <head>camera</head> had caught and held_on the paling photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire . In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her . It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea . The brothers drove down together in Mark 's small red sports_car , Mark at_the_wheel .</context>

Only an occasional tip turned_out to be a phony , and , like the police , Casey had made a point of running_down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time . He was in his car with his <head>camera</head> and equipment bag in less_than two minutes , and it took him only three more to reach the corner , a block from Columbus_Avenue . It was a district of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements , and he could see the police_radio_car as he rounded the corner and slammed_on the brakes . He did not bother with his radio - there would be time for that later - but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling_station and the public telephone_booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned . The police_car had pulled_up behind a small sedan , its headlights still on .</context>

      <context> `` In back , buddy '' , the driver said to me . Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel_bag over the low side rack , I stepped_on the running_board ; it flopped down , sprang back up and gouged my shin . The truck was hurtling forward . I seized the rack and made a western style flying mount just_in_time , one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel_bag - and merely wrecking my <head>camera</head> , I was to discover later - my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor_boards and - but this is no medical_report .

      <context> They 'd peddled the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when - with the addition of `` SX-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising_campaign - sales had soared practically into orbit . Their product had been endorsed by Good_Housekeeping , the A._M._A. , and the Veterinary_Journal , among other repositories of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you did n't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friends would think you did n't bathe . My lovely caller - Joyce_Holland was her name - had previously done three filmed commercials for ZING , and this_evening , the fourth , a super production , had been filmed at the home of Louis_Thor .

The finished - and drastically cut - product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering the suds , then bursting above the pool 's surface clad in layers of lavender lather , and I had a hunch this item was going_to sell tons and tons of soap ; even to clean men and boys .
