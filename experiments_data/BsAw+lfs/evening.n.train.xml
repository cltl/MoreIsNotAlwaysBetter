      <context> Television has yet to work_out a living_arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family . There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago style jazz in prime <head>evening</head> time , for_example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary . At_least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' , presented on NBC - TV Nov. 26 . The program came_out of the NBC Special Projects department , and was slotted in the Du_Pont_Show of the Week series . Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines .</context>

      <context> NBC had gathered a_lot of historical material which it was eager to share . For_example , there was sheet_music with the word `` jazz '' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took_hold . Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone_poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 's . However well_chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the <head>evening</head> 's main business , which ( considering the talent at_hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style . Another source of NBC pride was its rare film_clip of Bix_Beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew_by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted_out the entire glimpse . Similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz_groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal . `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' may have wound_up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer .</context>

      <context> The company which performed the Pulitzer_Prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce , the politicians are in fine voice , the chorines evoke happy memories , and the Little_Flower rides to break a lance again . I saw `` Fiorello ! '' performed in New_York by the original cast and I think this company is every_bit as good , and perhaps better . Certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking . Bob_Carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to LaGuardia as Tom_Bosley does , but I was amazed at the way he became more_and_more Fiorello as the <head>evening</head> progressed , until one had to catch_one's_self_up and remember that this was n't really LaGuardia come_back among us again . Then Rudy_Bond was simply grand as Ben , the distraught Republican_Party district chieftain . And Paul_Lipson , as Morris , the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley 's dinner , was fine , too . As for the ladies , they were full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man .</context>

      <context> Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free_rein . Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation . In these readings , the double_bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown 's attire - the musical equivalent of a bull_in_a_china_shop . Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and <head>evening</head> I listened to no fewer than ten different performances . The occasion for this marathon : Angel 's long awaited reissue in its `` Great_Recordings_of_the_Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro_Arte version . Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . Whether considered alone or in_relation_to other editions , COLH 40 is a document of prime importance .</context>

It had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long_since . The hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses . Cows were kept in backyard barns , boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and <head>evening</head> , were the boys ' coaxing voices , the thud of hooves , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide .</context>

      <context> Another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of Johns_Hopkins_University within walking distance of home . It was established in a_couple_of buildings in the shopping district , with only a_few professors , but all eminent men , and a_few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings . In September ' 76 Thomas_Huxley , Darwin 's famous disciple , came from England to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the University ; and although it was a school for men only , it afforded Henrietta an opportunity to attend its public_lectures . In the following year her father undertook to give a course in Hebrew theology to Johns_Hopkins students , and this brought to the Szold house a group of bright young Jews who had come to Baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma and entertained by Henrietta and Rachel , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting_room on Sunday <head>evenings</head> . From Philadelphia came Cyrus_Adler and Joseph_Jastrow . Adler , Judge_Sulzberger 's nephew , came to study Assyriology . A smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people , he was bound to go_far .</context>

      <context> For a number of years Kentucky , Louisiana and several other states have been building state sponsored vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties . These schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts . Transportation may be provided from nearby school districts . Courses are provided mainly for post high_school day programs ; but sometimes arrangements also are made for high_school students to attend , and <head>evening</head> extension courses also may be conducted . The Title 8 , program of the National_Defense_Education_Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools . By 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states . They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas .</context>

On Wednesday <head>evening</head> , November 23 , 1859 , in Warren , Rev._Mark_Trafton of New_Bedford , gave a `` Mission_of_Sympathy '' lecture in which he favorably viewed the Harper_'s_Ferry insurrection . The Warren_Telegraph stated that many of Rev._Trafton 's remarks were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism . In its account of the Trafton lecture , the Providence_Daily_Post said that the remarks of Rev._Trafton made the people indignant . No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence_Daily_Post , for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state_prison who were a_thousand times more deserving of sympathy .</context>

      <context> You have unwittingly set_in_motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . Quite candidly , fellows , I would n't be_in_your_shoes for all the rice in China . As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly . Sometime on Saturday <head>evening</head> , August 22nd , while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria_dell_'Orso , in Rome , you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks_County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . Hastening to the attic , the temperature of_which was easily hotter than the Gold_Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the_like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there . What you were looking_for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis_rackets and fly screens ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph_records scattered about a fumed_oak Victrola , you danced two tangos and a paso_doble , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu . You then descended one story , glommed a television_set from the music room - the only constructive feature of your visit , by_the_way - and , returning to the ground_floor , entered the master_bedroom .</context>
