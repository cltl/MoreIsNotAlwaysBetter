With the neutralists maintaining <head>pressure</head> for one of their own to succeed Mr._Hammarskjold , U_Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto .

At the University_of_Washington_Medical_School , the electronics group has developed the `` Respiratory_Gas_Analyzer '' shown in Fig. 3 . This unit , affectionately dubbed `` The_Monster '' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient 's breathing .

Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing_still , or in some other medically significant position .

      <context> Its value was * * f from the above data . This appears to be high , as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops . It is appropriate to call_attention_to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal_gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation . The internal energy of an ideal_gas depends_on temperature only and is independent of <head>pressure</head> or volume . In_other_words , if an ideal_gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat_sink . This means that work equals q which in_turn equals * * f . There is a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that * * f , where \q is the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal_gas ) could be reached by chance alone .</context>

      <context> The Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive_force of the impinging solar_radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . The radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size - a 1000 - | m diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years . Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar corpuscular_radiation <head>pressure</head> , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . Further , the corpuscular_radiation , i.e. , the solar_wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive_force to the gravitational_force . The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi major_axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor_axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . Also , planetary gravitational_attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached .</context>

A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table 5 - 1 . From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude . The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density * * f except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar_system in the presence of solar_radiation <head>pressure</head> . The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors . It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant . The values agree with the data from 1958_Alpha and 1959_Eta .</context>

      <context> When the early part of the gradient was flattened , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` cone sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P._J. and R._S. , Fig. 1 and E._M. , Fig. 2 ) . The latter procedure gave_rise to a small active protein peak ( Region 1a ) between Regions 1 and 2 . In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected ( Region 3 , Fig. 1 ) . Moreover , after concentration using negative <head>pressure</head> dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated 2a ( donors P._J. , D._A. , and J._F. , Fig. 1 ) . Not all these regions exhibited equal agglutinating_activity , as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas . In all cases , most of the activity lay_in the region of high anionic binding capacity . This was particularly noticeable in group A and group B sera , in which cases activity in Regions 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at_all .</context>

The level of average_cost ( equal to marginal_cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate . The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership , and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate . The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy - its concern with employment makes itself felt in <head>pressure</head> upon the government to maintain full employment . The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases , but we abstract from these forces here .

      <context> Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . In_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells_out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union <head>pressures</head> for higher wages .

      <context> Attending the life_class was my idea - or rather , Askington 's idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two would n't have gone if I had n't talked them into it . I wanted to paint again . I had n't done a serious picture in almost a year . It was n't just the <head>pressure</head> of work , although that was the excuse I often used , even to myself . It was the kind of work I was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting . I kept saying , `` If I could just build_up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get_to be well_known as an illustrator - like Peter_Askington , for_instance - then I could take some time_off and paint '' . Askington was a kind of goal I set myself ; I had admired him long before I talked to him .</context>

      <context> Did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean_out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? Did men become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let_go ? It might be that certain people were_born with a compulsion to complicate their lives , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizards in the sun , too indolent to blink their eyes . Perhaps it was his misfortune , or good_fortune , whichever way one looked_at it , to belong_to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build_up <head>pressure</head> in a world which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to_it . And then_again perhaps the reason why he could n't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back and watching the clouds go_by , was because he did n't want to do them . There was no compulsion behind them . They could be done or left undone and nobody really gave_a_damn .</context>
