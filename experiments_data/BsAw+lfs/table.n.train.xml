      <context> Obviously , a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in_place_of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil . Substances other_than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases . This is particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall_into the class of polyelectrolytes . Whereas the usual organic surface-active_agent is strongly sorbed at oil-water_interfaces , the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure ( see <head>Table</head> 26 - 2 on p. 1678 ) . Thus , for aqueous media , we can think_of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active_agent , and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active_agent . From the equilibrium sorption data which are available , it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative_charge . The charged particles then repel each other and are also repelled from the charged surface , which almost invariably bears a negative_charge under washing conditions .</context>

The diurnal_variation in the observed flux may be partly due_to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity . The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data . A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in <head>Table</head> 5 - 1 . From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude .

The older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic_energy into light .

A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 ) . Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites .

The observational data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region .

The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early_childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . Second , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . Although the standard_deviation values on which spread of the lines are based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( <head>Table</head> 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . Third , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . It is convenient to classify a child 's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according_to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line .</context>

      <context> One growth center in a short_bone - distal phalanx of the second finger - was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short_bones , occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage . Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , dietary patterns , and health during adolescence . The following summary , based on Figures 5 and 6 , is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with_respect_to the appropriate mean age for each growth center . At the top of Figure 5 , for_example , the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according_to their mean and standard_deviation values in <head>Table</head> 1 . The 34 arrows , denoting onset age plus completion age deviations , have been arrayed in an Onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 34 girls .

      <context> Fourth , the two indicators are for_the_most_part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center . The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood . Onsets , Completions , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile . It may be assumed that differences in ratings due_to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according_to existing <head>tables</head> of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body . Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence . It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement .

As one approach to doing this , Figures 3 and 4 have been constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 . The differences between onset age and completion age with_respect_to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows .

She was personally sloppy , and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist , and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves .

      <context> For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a <head>table</head> in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor . The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue_pie , gets a plate of English_muffins instead . Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after_all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks_Atkinson retired .</context>
