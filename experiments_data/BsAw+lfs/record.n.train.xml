      <context> You definitely hear some of the instruments close_up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back . This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound . London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels . These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the <head>record</head> . In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special_effects . Some clue to the character of London 's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion '' or `` percussive '' . Drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive_instruments are reproduced remarkably well .</context>

      <context> In_the_end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings . Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at_times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song . The engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result . Too many <head>records</head> seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment . The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration . Your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score .

      <context> Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing_out that rocklike materials which are likely to make_up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio_waves , although opaque to infrared_radiation . The infrared_emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due_to solar_radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase . Since the absorption of radio_waves in rocklike material varies with wave_length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material . The radio_emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when Burke and Franklin ( 1955 ) identified the origin of interference like radio_noise on their <head>records</head> at about 15 meters wave_length as emission from Jupiter . This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 ) .

      <context> It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of New_York . They were n't as well paid as they should have been . One reason the portwatchers let Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen . Sposato needed a front , some labor stiff with a clean <head>record</head> to act_as business_agent of the Redhook local . There I was a retired wobbly and structural iron_worker who 'd never gouged a cent off a fellow_worker in my thirty years in the movement . For once radicalism was a recommendation . Sposato could n't wait to get me hired .</context>

      <context> This was a broth_of_a_boy , our Felix , and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full of juice and spirit . We followed him up_the_stairs . The cops would gather_up Connor and the foursome on the third floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting . You may think we did n't need Nancy and Jean , but you always get what you can when you can , and we had no guarantee that a fingerprint <head>record</head> on them could n't be useful before we were through_with this case . Also , if we had excluded the ladies we would have_to that extent let the whole world know at_least that much of where we stood . The killer , if in our present group , would certainly be interested in knowing that much , and even_though with the fingerprint evidence what it was I could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation , there might always be some way . If you can possibly avoid it , you do n't hand_out any extra chances .</context>

      <context> A conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor . Her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor 's notes on an emergency case . It read : `` Shot in the lumbar region '' . After a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she typed into the <head>record</head> : `` Shot in the woods '' . There are many grammatical misconstructions other_than dangling_modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations .
