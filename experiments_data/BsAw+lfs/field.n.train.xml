As a boy Roy_Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods . His father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting_expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature . Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the <head>field</head> , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on_the_wing - almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . It is this subject_matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors . Mason had_to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting . Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family_business which , though it was allied to art of a kind - the design and production of engraved seals - bore no relation to the painting of pictures .</context>

I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth .

Again , Henley 's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self mastery is far from characteristic of a Stoic thinker like Marcus_Aurelius , whose gentle acquiescence is almost Christian , comparable_to the patience expressed in Milton 's sonnet on his own blindness . In recent years , we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts , although these aspects should be studied in_conjunction_with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the sciences .

The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference * * f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear .

There is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as_such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear <head>fields</head> . These droplets are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one 's hands .

      <context> If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . First , T may not have a single characteristic value ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar_field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed . Second , even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely over F into a product of polynomials of degree 1 , there may not be enough characteristic vectors for T to span the space V ; this is clearly a deficiency in T . The second situation is illustrated by the operator T on * * f ( F any <head>field</head> ) represented in the standard basis by * * f . The characteristic polynomial for A is * * f and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for A ( or for T ) . Thus T is not diagonalizable . One sees that this happens because the null_space of * * f has dimension 1 only .</context>

After the game , Phil was taking_off his sweatshirt in the dressing_room when Mike_Deegan came_in . `` It 's a helluva thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a guy 's own team-mate won n't come_out and help him in a fight '' . Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head .</context>

      <context> But Mike_Deegan was boiling mad now . When the inning was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all_the_way into the dugout . Phil_Rossoff , coming_in from left_field , stopped at the water_fountain for a drink . Mike_Deegan was standing beside it , facing the <head>field</head> . He was eyeing the Anniston catcher warming_up his pitcher before the inning began . `` Keep your eyes open , sonny '' ! Mike yelled to the catcher .</context>

      <context> Both fell heavily to the ground . Only Mike got to his feet . He went_back to touch home_plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking_back . The Anniston players and their manager ran out on the <head>field</head> . They poured water over their catcher 's face . He did not move . Then the manager called_for a doctor .</context>

      <context> The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer . Then , quickly , and a_little nervously , the doctor ordered a_couple_of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing_room . Mike_Deegan was sitting on the bench , watching . When the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the <head>field</head> he said : `` That ought to teach the sonofabitch '' . Phil_Rossoff , seated next to Deegan , got_up and moved to the other end of the bench . The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout . He was followed by four of his men .</context>

      <context> `` That 's what you say '' . The Anniston manager looked at Eddie_Lee . It was a cold and calculated look . He turned and went_back across the <head>field</head> to his dugout . He called_in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston . The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike_Deegan came up to bat . Everyone in the ball_park seemed to be standing and shouting .</context>

      <context> `` Tell me - what do you do at the park '' ? he asked . This was delivered in a forthright way , without coyness and over pretended interest - an admirable way with children . Only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command . This nettled the children into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide <head>fields</head> of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment . `` We bump '' , one said ; and the other went_on to development of the idea . `` We grind , too '' , he said . My mother was beside_herself with curiosity .</context>
