      <context> A group of researchers at the University_of_Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques . One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched . A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed . Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood_vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic <head>energy</head> . The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes about 16 | msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue . A sonar or radar type of pulse_generator and time-delay_measuring_system is required for body tissue evaluation . In_addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique .</context>

In this novel arrangement the `` pill '' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in_which the capacitor is formed by a pressure sensing transducer . As shown in Fig. 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400 - kc. bursts . The <head>energy</head> received by the `` pill '' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ringing '' takes_place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' . These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained . One of the advantages of_this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions .

      <context> But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather_than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location . Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness . Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists_of minute waves of <head>energy</head> . We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound_waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite . So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states_of_matter , successive one_after_another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies . This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .</context>

There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed_out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar .

Religion at its best is out in_front , ever beckoning and leading_on , and , as Lippman put it , `` mobilizing all man 's scattered <head>energies</head> in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance '' . At_the_same_time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment , it also has great therapeutic value for him . It gives him aid , comfort , even solace , in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate . He is confronted with the recurrent crises , such_as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life - marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old_age , the certainty of death .</context>

      <context> Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state . The belief in immortality , where held , functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here_and_now . The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance . The feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as_well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving_vent to emotions and <head>energies</head> . In providing for these inner individual functions , religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace_of_mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution . In_addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society . The two have never been separable .</context>

      <context> The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools . According_to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit . The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released <head>energy</head> toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem . Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced . The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination . But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple .</context>

      <context> It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you '' ? She clearly agreed that this had been the case . I realized , now , that she had been showing me , in what impressed me as being a very accurate way , something her mother had once said to her ; it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her . What had been an unmanageably powerful introject was now , despite its continuing charge of <head>energy</head> disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like . Earlier , this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at_times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice . A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used_to often seclude herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door - as I would find on passing_by , between our sessions - for_all_the_world like two persons , a scolding mother and a defensive child . Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome .</context>

      <context> Scotty was neutral . He did not resent their supervision or Virginia 's sometimes tiring sympathy . He ate what he felt_like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the draughty rooms of the house , when he was not in bed , with slow dubious steps , like an elderly tourist in a cathedral . His <head>energy</head> was gone . He was able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living_room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving . His hands lay loosely , yet stiffly - they were like wax hands : almost lifelike , not quite - folded in his lap ; his mouth hung slightly open . When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable , he would answer ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a_little louder .</context>

It required an <head>energy</head> he no_longer possessed to be satirical about his father . His father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look_at his son . After a pause , during which he studied Scotty 's face as if Scotty were not there and could not study him too , Mr._McKinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs . Scotty would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat .</context>

      <context> He respected each of these approach techniques , and kept them in character : his quill drawings had a scratchiness , suggesting skin texture ; the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an abdomen , in a reclining torso ; the wax he smoothed_over to give the body surface an elastic pull . Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; they remained rough starting_points . When carving he was charged with spontaneous <head>energy</head> ; too_careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model . The true surge had to be inside the marble itself . Drawing and models were his thinking . Carving was action .</context>

      <context> Our suspicions eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a grocer 's boy , a thoroughly bad_hat , who delivered cartons to the people overhead . The more I probed into this young_man 's activities and character , the less savory I found him . I learned , for_example , that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet . His <head>energy</head> was prodigious ; sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage_collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx_Zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar_butts against their paws . Evenings , he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like Enrico + Paglieri's or Peter's_Backyard drunkenly donning ladies ' hats and singing `` O_Sole_Mio '' . In_short , and to borrow an arboreal phrase , slash_timber . Well , the odious little toad went_along chivying animals and humans who could n't retaliate , and in_due_course , as was inevitable , overreached himself .</context>
