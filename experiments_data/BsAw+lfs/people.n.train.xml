From a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro_Arte <head>people</head> fail to enter into the spirit of things here . The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy .

At the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father_Lucian_Galtier in 1840 . Its <head>people</head> , including Pierre_Bottineau and other American_Fur_Company employees and the refugees from Fort_Garry , were joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort_Snelling when Major_Joseph_Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840 . The resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father_Galtier 's mission , St._Paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take_on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red_River . While population at Fort_Garry increased rapidly , from 2417 in 1831 to 4369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate . Accordingly , though the practice violated the no trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's_Bay_Company , some settlers went into trade .</context>

      <context> On the other we have the flag_wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways . After_all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates .

If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public .

      <context> Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement .

      <context> Therefore , the scholar , as he looks_at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts . 1 ) Most_of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at_all . 2 ) The concept that an `` American national folklore '' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend . Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of <head>people</head> preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission . It has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression . Related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence . Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter .</context>

Nor have we remembered that in the melting_pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material . Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the <head>people</head> with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant .

On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought_out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make_up this nation .</context>

      <context> This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches . It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle_classes . It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities . Whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to_which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class <head>people</head> . Attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches ; this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle_classes .

These values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations .</context>

Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense . A word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene '' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings . Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that <head>people</head> react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field . A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy . The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials . When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .</context>

      <context> Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus_Baldwin_Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy_Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him . Others who wrote_of low characters and low life included Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , creator of the Big_Bear of Arkansas and Tom_Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson_Jones_Hooper , whose character Simon_Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem_Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried_out his will ; and George_Washington_Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut_Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner 's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a_hundred years ago with a class of <head>people</head> and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner 's time . Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long established literary precedent . Such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ; nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters . One of the early humorists already mentioned , Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials .</context>

Still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one 's ideas of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic_books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of_this influence . Probably the most important thing to focus_on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available . This is in large part a code_of_behavior and a glossary of values : what is it that <head>people</head> do and should do and_how one should regard it . In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint . Literature may be said to give people a sense_of_purpose , dedication , mission , significance .

      <context> Probably the most important thing to focus_on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available . This is in large part a code_of_behavior and a glossary of values : what is it that people do and should do and_how one should regard it . In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint . Literature may be said to give <head>people</head> a sense_of_purpose , dedication , mission , significance . This , no_doubt , is part of what Gilbert_Seldes implies when he says of the arts , `` They give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense '' . Men seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that_is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized . Feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation .</context>

      <context> The late R._G._Collingwood , a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature , once wrote `` We are all , though many_of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with Chaucer and Cimabue , or even Shakespeare and Titian . By an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and Japanese colour prints ; but the possibility of this effort is bound_up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries , and it is utterly impossible to <head>people</head> in whom this development has not taken_place . The natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art , to despise and dislike the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else '' . One might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general public , of the newspaper_critic , and of the creative artist himself . There results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary .</context>

      <context> The Jews for 2500 years have been a prime example , though the adherents of any world or inter people religion are cases_in_point . it might be pointed_out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings - political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic . Religion usually exercises a stabilizing conserving function . As_such it acts_as an anchor for the <head>people</head> . There is a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change , not_only in their own doctrines and policies and practices , but also in secular affairs having religious relevance . It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones . It tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments , the traditional ways of thinking , and the customary ways of living .</context>

In hunger stimulates man too the situation is very similar . Strong stress on hunger treats hunger as an additional stimulus , strong stress on stimulates treats stimulation as an additional effect of hunger , strong stress on man treats man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger .

      <context> Raymond_Vernon reports that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the lot next_door . If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened_away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program . And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice <head>people</head> '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble . Today , according_to land economist Homer_Hoyt , shopping_centers and their associated parking_lots cover some 46000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land_area in all the nation 's Central Business_Districts put together .

This nettled the children into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown <head>people</head> , but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment . `` We bump '' , one said ; and the other went_on to development of the idea . `` We grind , too '' , he said . My mother was beside_herself with curiosity .</context>

      <context> We caught the early train to New_York . The Dharma_Dictionary , a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with Eurasian proto-senility cults . It 's somewhat off_the_beaten_track , to_be_sure , but therein lies its variety and charm . For_example , probably very few <head>people</head> know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate . Likewise , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely synonyms as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue-twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen '' all originated_in the same village in Bathar-on-Walli_Province and are all used to express sentiments concerning British `` imperialism '' . The terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start spouting them to your date , it might be best to find_out if he was a member of Major_Pockmanster 's Delhi_Regiment , since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in_that outfit . The_Breeze_And_Chancellor_Neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concerns the attempts of a West German politician to woo a plaster_cast of the Apollo_Belvedere .</context>

      <context> The collective by which I address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in_use among professional thieves . It is , I am reliably given to understand , the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost ; i.e. , burglars who rob while the tenants are absent , in contrast to hot slough prowlers , those who work while the occupants are home . Since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior . Far from it ; I merely draw an etymological distinction , hoping that specialists and busy <head>people</head> like you will welcome such precision in a layman . Above_all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence , to whimper over the loss of a_few objets_d'art , or to shame you into rectitude . My object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict . You have unwittingly set_in_motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them .</context>

      <context> A_couple_of years back , I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a `` coffin turn '' . In it was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked_up in Bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a_few pennies in its lap . After a while , we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it . Our suspicions eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a grocer 's boy , a thoroughly bad_hat , who delivered cartons to the <head>people</head> overhead . The more I probed into this young_man 's activities and character , the less savory I found him . I learned , for_example , that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet . His energy was prodigious ; sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage_collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx_Zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar_butts against their paws .</context>

      <context> `` I would n't be_in_his_shoes for all the rice in China . There 's some kind_of a nemesis haunting his footsteps '' . However one looks_at it , therefore , I 'd say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy . The inventory you acquired from me is n't going_to be easy to move ; you can't very well sidle up to <head>people</head> on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva . Additionally , since you 're going_to be hors_de_combat pretty soon with sprue , yaws , Delhi_boil , the Granville_wilt , liver_fluke , bilharziasis , and a host of other complications of the hex you 've aroused , you must n't expect to be lionized socially . My advice , if you live long enough to continue your vocation , is that the next time you 're attracted by the exotic , pass it up - it 's nothing but a headache . As you can count_on me to do the same .</context>
