      <context> As cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy increasing properties of the external world . The useful suggestion of Professor_David_Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments . One wonders about its applicability to people .

      <context> From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public_Law 236 , 66_th_Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation_program has been to assist the States , by means of grants-in-aid , to return disabled men and women to productive , gainful employment . The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation_program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social_Security_Act in 1935 . Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78_th_Congress in 1943 passed P._L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing <head>structure</head> . Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness .</context>

Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing_out that rocklike materials which are likely to make_up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio_waves , although opaque to infrared_radiation . The infrared_emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due_to solar_radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase . Since the absorption of radio_waves in rocklike material varies with wave_length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the <head>structure</head> or composition of the lunar surface material . The radio_emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when Burke and Franklin ( 1955 ) identified the origin of interference like radio_noise on their records at about 15 meters wave_length as emission from Jupiter . This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 ) . Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 a , b , c ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 ) .</context>

The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated . Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies_in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity . A state of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not_only an increase in the parasympathetic reactivity this <head>structure</head> to direct and reflexly induced stimuli , but leads also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus acting sympathetically under control_conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response !

Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the <head>structures</head> of a modern political and social_system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective . In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them - and that with independence free_men do not have_to work to realize the benefits of modern life . For_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement .</context>

      <context> Indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant . We speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules and achieve in_spite_of the lack of direction from the environment . It is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores ( although not significantly lower ) . Possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own <head>structure</head> . Our conjecture is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work . When helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation , then , and only then , does such a child attain unusual success . The statistical analyses of achievement in_relation_to anxiety and teaching_methods and the interactions of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4 .</context>

      <context> It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of <head>structure</head> in teaching_method . The structured schools were in an industrial city , with three family tenement_houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes . The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle - to upper-middle_class , but fringed by an industrial area . In_order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods .</context>

      <context> The statement of the system is a different matter . Smaller systems can of_course be stated much more succinctly . A phonemic_system can be stated without reference_to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics . And the more complex the morphophonemic_system is in_relation_to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic_system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics - at_least , the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful <head>structures</head> . The design of orthographies has received much less attention from linguists than the problem deserves . There has been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance . This seems naive .</context>

      <context> Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology when designing orthographies . Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs . The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic ' esthetics ' , which usually turns_out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried_over from European languages . Many_of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language <head>structures</head> that they purport to represent . Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance . As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion . A._E._Sharp , in Vowel-Length_and_Syllabicity_in_Kikuyu , examines one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in_detail .</context>

      <context> On these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the Iliad . Everywhere within the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; Greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized , and plagued , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors . Further we cannot go , for the Dark_ages deserve their name . Many aspects of civilization were not_yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty <head>structure</head> . The epic_poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the rise of firm political_units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men - all these had to await the progress of following decades . What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search . These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces .</context>

He could no_longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here_and_there he was taken_to_task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no_longer disputable as to its other values . Stowey_Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality . He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rose at half past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn_flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald_Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh_Gazette , then put_on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop .</context>
