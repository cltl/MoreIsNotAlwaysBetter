      <context> The American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course . An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior_design , for_the_most_part schools accredited by membership in the National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art , and a further `` on_the_spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations . One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions .

      <context> The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior_designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference_of_opinion . The architects do not believe that the education of the interior_designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . Ordinary politeness may have militated against this <head>opinion</head> being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round_tables , workshops or panel_discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled_down crux_of_the_matter is education . It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior_designer 's training .</context>

      <context> After the diagnosing , he left the course , convinced that it could do him no good . We may say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment . The engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life - and refused to change it . We may say that his attitude was foolish , since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills ; or we may say that his attitude was commendable , showing his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the <head>opinions</head> of others . In_any_case , he refused to accept the implications of the analysis , that he needed to be made_over . Another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis , and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis . In a course for supermarket operators , a district_manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly successful as a store manager , found that in supervising other managers he was having a difficult time .</context>

      <context> Freeman , Cameron and McGhie , in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard_to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation '' . In my experience , a great many_of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience . Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene . Recently , for_example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her <head>opinion</head> , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was . Or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a simile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking . Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is , more_often_than_not , entirely unaware . His subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one .</context>

      <context> Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . At another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother introject began to emerge more_and_more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' ! I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; but a_few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you '' ! Again , I at_first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication , and I quickly cast through my mind to account_for her being able to speak , with such utter conviction , of an <head>opinion</head> held by my father , now several years deceased . Then I replied , coldly , `` If you despise me , why do n't you say so , directly '' ? She looked confused at this , and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make . It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you '' ?</context>

      <context> I did n't offer any advice , but I certainly did not want to go_back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out . Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the_British would be gone ; but Cousin_Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning , and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass , what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts . While this was being discussed , we saw the militia to the west of us fanning_out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road . It was the <head>opinion</head> of some of us that these must be part of the Committeemen who had been in the Battle_of_the_North_Bridge , which entitled them to a sort of veteran status , and we felt that if they employed this tactic , it was likely enough the best one . Mattathias_Dover said : `` It makes_sense . If we cluster together , the redcoats can make an advantage out of_it , but there 's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except chase us , and we can outrun them '' .</context>

      <context> It was amazing how they had herded together for protection : an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper , rising from the breakfast_table ; a gross boy in his teens , shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; a girl in her twenties , fat and sullen , descending the marble staircase ; then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor . They answered him in monosyllables , nods , occasionally muttering in Greek to one another , awaiting the word from Papa , who restlessly cracked his knuckles , anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst off to the freeway . No , they had n't seen anyone around ; no , they did n't know the Andrus family ; yes , they had read about the case ; yes , they had let some reporters use their phone , but they would no_longer . They offered no <head>opinions</head> , volunteered nothing , betrayed no emotions . Studying them , McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple . The Skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human_beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy . He imagined they were the kind whose tax_returns were never examined ( if they were , they were never penalized ) , whose children had no unhappy romances , whose names never knew scandal .</context>

      <context> He had lunch with Pauling . Promptly at one-thirty he entered Hohlbein and Garth 's elegant suite of offices in Medfield 's newest professional building . He disliked Garth on sight , conservative clothes and haircut , smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties , handclasp too consciously quick and firm . Youngish man on_the_make , Madden labeled him , and was ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion , the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions ; that Mrs._Garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer ; that there were three children , two boys and a girl ; that she was active in the Woman 's Club and he in Lions , Rotary , and Jaycee ; and finally , that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox <head>opinion</head> since their wedding_day . Madden knew that he could be completely wrong about all this , but also knew that he would go right on disliking Garth . Garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair , which would not , he said more than once , have ever come_about if Mrs._Meeker had only seen fit to consult Mr._Hohlbein or him about it . Madden regretted not being able to find_fault_with so true a statement .</context>
