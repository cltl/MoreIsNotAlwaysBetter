If they were , Walter_Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George_Sokolsky , and Herblock would have nothing to draw cartoons about . I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions . The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and <head>justice</head> and peace and material prosperity ; and in_particular - since this is our special responsibility - that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United_States . I speak_of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved - ever - reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human_beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around . These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism . This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in_practice , antithetical to these conditions ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization .</context>

      <context> When I question them as_to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall_into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things do n't count any_more in the world of to-day . I am naive , they say , to make use of such words . I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? - liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social <head>justice</head> is so great that individual and local liberties as_well_as democratic processes may have to yield before it . This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a President of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme_Court .

      <context> Related_to , but distinguishable from , nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another . Increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions . The efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions , particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of industrialization , led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions . Law became a conscious process , something more than simply doing <head>justice</head> and looking_to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms . Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no_longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed . The old way of doing things , which depended_on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no_longer adequate_to the task .

      <context> Man , through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny . The theory did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a Hegelian mystique . It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government . It was not opposed to either <head>justice</head> or morality ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority . Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society . To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative_officials and judges - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with . Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society .</context>

They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of <head>Justice</head> into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain .

To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy .

J._Wheaton_Smith , editor of the Warren_Telegraph stated that `` the ends of <head>justice</head> must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in_order_that all those misnamed philantropists [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' . The editor of the Newport_Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment . In direct_contrast to the other Rhode_Island editors , Samuel_S._Foss of the Woonsocket_Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair . Concerning the sentence , Foss wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John_Brown 's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment , it would be well - well for the country and for Virginia '' .</context>

      <context> For it had turned_out , by a further paradox of Cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging . In the Analytical phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not_only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in_order to preserve it ; they had also had to generalize it - to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as_such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself . In_order to be saved , plasticity had had to be isolated ; and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more_or_less interchangeable and contour obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method , the subject itself became largely unrecognizable . Cubism , in its 1911 - 1912 phase ( which the_French , with <head>justice</head> , call `` hermetic '' ) was on the verge of abstract_art . It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation . If they opted_for illusion , it could only be illusion per_se - an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual objects . If , on_the_other_hand , they opted_for representation , it had to be representation per_se - representation as image pure_and_simple , without connotations ( at_least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed .</context>

      <context> Houses of settlers who 'd treated the company herds as a natural_resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards . The small half-heartedly tended fields of men who 'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow . No cow thief could count_on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any_longer . Jury , judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of <head>justice</head> the men of the new West had believed long outdated . For three straight years , Tom_Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures , and how_many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he killed Lewis and Powell ) will never be known . It is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at_all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state . It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him .</context>
