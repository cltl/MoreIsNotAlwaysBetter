      <context> However , because the planet is rotating underneath the atmosphere , and frictional <head>forces</head> arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it , the air flow from center to periphery is not direct , but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect , or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference . Viewed from above this twist in wind direction is in the same direction as the rotation of the planet . The scientific terms in English used to describe the weather systems generated by highs and lows were introduced in the mid-1800s , mostly by the British .</context>

      <context> A quick touchdown resulted . `` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right_away '' , said Stram , quipping , `` I think I 'll put that play in the book '' . The early Southwest_Conference football leaders - Texas , Arkansas and Texas_A+M - made a big dent in the statistics last week . Texas ' 545 - yard spree against Washington_State gave the Longhorns a 3 - game total offense of 1512 yards ( 1065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC <head>high</head> . Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A+M , with a 38 - point bulge against Texas_Tech ran_up its biggest total loop play since 1950 . Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards . Texas leads in per game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor 's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas ' 189 ) .</context>

      <context> Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent_on following compulsively in his footsteps . When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural . Thus , when the Russians sent up their first sputnik , American chagrin was human enough , and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable . But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new <head>high</head> in statesmanlike folly . When East_Germans fled to the West by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists . They are less vocal now , when it is the West_Berliners who are migrating . The flood is not as great - only 700 a week according_to one apparently conservative account - but it is symptomatic .</context>

      <context> The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values . The engineering as_such never obtrudes_upon your consciousness . The effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance . This absence of peaky <head>highs</head> and beefed-up bass not_only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue . A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained . The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental_to playing . Yet you feel the orchestra is near at_hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall .</context>

      <context> You will come_up with a frightening total . That 's why the FDA , the American_Medical_Association ( AMA ) , and the National_Better_Business_Bureau ( BBB ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $ 610 million or_so paid to medical charlatans annually . The Postmaster_General recently reported that mail_order frauds - among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently - are at the highest level in history . Similarly , the American_Cancer_Society ( ACS ) , the Arthritis_and_Rheumatism_Foundation , and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new <head>high</head> . For_example , the BBB has reported it was receiving four_times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as_many complaints compared with two years ago . Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come_up with is only a surface manifestation - turned_up by their inevitably limited policing - of the real loot of the medical racketeer . In this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative .</context>
