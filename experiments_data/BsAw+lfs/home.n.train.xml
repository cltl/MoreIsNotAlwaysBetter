      <context> It was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with_respect_to the personality variables under investigation . An interview schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepared , and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home . The parent was asked to describe the child 's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self and others , irrational conformity to rules , orderliness , punctuality , and need for certainty . The interviewers were instructed not to suggest answers and , as_much_as_possible , to record the parents ' actual words as they described the child 's behavior in <head>home</head> situations . The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the interview records , categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity , then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records . Final ratings were made on the basis of a point_system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that was deviant from the discovered norms . Children scoring high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations , or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals .</context>

      <context> Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . This probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment_compensation or a Youth_Conservation_Corps . A maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from <head>home</head> . A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor . Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training .

      <context> These stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more_and_more dry_goods . If the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar_volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put_in the bank . In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated . No suburban shopping-center branch - not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the <head>home</head> store . Telephone_orders distort the picture : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather_than a central city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminates city sales_tax . The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened .</context>

      <context> The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches . Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act_as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover . When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing . Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easier than to the downtown department_store , though both are the same distance from <head>home</head> . Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown . Raymond_Vernon reports that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the lot next_door .</context>

      <context> Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central_city would be likely to destroy this preference - and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians , is actually upon us . In their book American_Skyline , Christopher_Tunnard and Henry_Hope_Reed argue that Franklin_Roosevelt 's New_Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility - a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote . The first superhighways - New_York 's Henry_Hudson and Chicago 's Lake_Shore , San_Francisco 's Bay_Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania_Turnpike - were built as part of the federal works_program which was going_to cure the depression .

      <context> The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities - the rubber factories in Akron , Chrysler 's Detroit plants , U._S._Steel 's Pittsburgh works - often began on these sites at_a_time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( piers ) and power ( river ) . The `` leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam_turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not_yet blighted . The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in selecting his plant site . Until internal_combustion became cheap , he had_to be near a railroad_siding and a trolley_line or an existing large community of lower-class <head>homes</head> . The railroad_siding is still important - it is usually , though not always , true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper than trucking . But anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad . And there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking_lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush_hour traffic and grille route bus_lines , is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory .</context>
