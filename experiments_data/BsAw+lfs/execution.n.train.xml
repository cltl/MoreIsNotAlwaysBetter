      <context> Those actions produce effects according to the semantics of the instructions in <head>the</head> program . Programs for a computer may execute in a batch process without human interaction , or a user may type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter . In this case the " commands " are simply programs , whose execution is chained together .</context>

      <context> The program then runs until it ends , either normal termination or a crash . Translators usually produce an <head>abstract</head> result that is not completely ready to execute . Frequently , the operating system will convert the translator 's object code into the final executable form just before execution of the program begins .</context>

      <context> The term <head>run</head> is used almost synonymously . A related meaning of both " to run " and " to execute " refers to the specific action of a user starting ( or launching or invoking ) a program , as in " Please run the application . " Prior to execution , a program must first be written .</context>

      <context> This is generally <head>done</head> in source code , which is then compiled at compile time ( and statically linked at link time ) to an executable . This executable is then invoked , most often by an operating system , which loads the program into memory ( load time ) , possibly performs dynamic linking , and then begins execution by moving control to the entry point of the program ; all these steps depend on the Application Binary Interface of the operating system . At this point execution begins and the program enters run time .</context>

      <context> As with most legal terms , the precise definition of murder varies between jurisdictions and is usually codified in some form of legislation . Even when the legal distinction between murder and manslaughter is clear , it is not unknown for a jury to find <head>a</head> murder defendant guilty of the lesser offence . The jury might sympathise with the defendant ( e.g. in a crime of passion , or in the case of a bullied victim who kills their tormentor ) , and the jury may wish to protect the defendant from a sentence of life imprisonment or execution .</context>

      <context> A writ of execution ( <head>also</head> known as an execution ) is a court order granted to put in force a judgment of possession obtained by a plaintiff from a court . When issuing a writ of execution , a court typically will order a sheriff or other similar official to take possession of property owned by a judgment debtor .</context>

      <context> Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition . If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result . Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call ' clicking ' . `` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid <head>execution</head> , he would do_well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition . `` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color . Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in_relation_to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat . When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor - if I have been working on a full sheet in the field .</context>

      <context> They include both individual fears and collective ones . They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not_only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group . Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized . Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous <head>execution</head> one had been unaware of the really decisive act . To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition . But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating . The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave_rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize .</context>

      <context> The Woonsocket_Patriot admitted that John_Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no_more be hung than Henry_A._Wise or James_Buchanan '' . The Newport_Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him . In her letter to John_Brown , `` E._B. '' , the Quakeress from Newport , had suggested that the American people owed more honor to John_Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George_Washington . During the latter days of November to the day of Brown 's <head>execution</head> , it seems that most Rhode_Islanders did not concur in `` E._B. 's '' suggestion . On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown 's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions . A week later the Daily_Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John_Brown on the day of his execution . The editor of the Daily_Journal warned , `` that if such a demonstration be made , it will not find support or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak_for Providence '' .</context>

      <context> Extraordinary precautions were taken so that no stranger be allowed_in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surrounding the scaffold . In many Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church_bells were tolled . Such was not the case in Rhode_Island . The only public demonstration in honor of John_Brown was held at Pratt_'s_Hall in Providence , on the day of his <head>execution</head> . Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt_Hall meeting `` brought_together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many_of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' . Seated on the platform were Amos_C._Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; Thomas_Davis , an uncompromising Garrisonian ; the Reverend_Augustus_Woodbury , a Unitarian minister ; the Reverend_George_T._Day , a Free-Will Baptist ; Daniel_w._Vaughan , and William_H._H._Clements .
