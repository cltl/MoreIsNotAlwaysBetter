      <context> `` Only a discontinuity can end it '' , Professor_Morrison writes . `` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' . Morrison points_out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet_Union or Red_China , it is the most vulnerable of the great_powers - Europe of_course must be written_off out_of_hand . He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United_States is the least risky <head>path</head> our government can take . His proposal is opposed to that of Richard_Nixon , Governor_Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic_Energy_Commission , Dr._Edward_Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold_war . These gentlemen are calling_for a resumption of testing - in the atmosphere - on the greatest possible scale , all in_the_name_of national security . Escalation is their first love and their last ; they will be faithful unto death .</context>

      <context> When these had been pocketed , we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors indicated . We showed them to each other and said `` Would you have guessed '' ? Squatting on our haunches beside the flat stone we broke them on , we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive : safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by . Thus shielded , we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness ; even when the fences became a part of the game - when a vine embowered gate-post was the Sleeping_Beauty 's enchanted castle , or when Rapunzel let_down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we paid little heed to those who went_by on the <head>path</head> outside . We enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school . In the heat of the summer , the garden solitudes were ours alone ; our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front_porch . They never troubled_themselves about us while we were playing , because the fence formed such a definite boundary and `` Do n't go outside the gate '' was a command so impossible of misinterpretation .</context>

      <context> What one actually remembers is its greenness . From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible . One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower . Every <head>path</head> from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit_trees . In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet_shrub , snowball , rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead . From above one could only occasionally catch_a_glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block . That was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch .</context>

      <context> It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins ' pronouncement in Pleas_of_the_Crown from a metaphysical point_of_view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married_couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such_that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal_law as if there were no marriage . By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the <head>path</head> charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of law '' .</context>

      <context> Well developed respiratory bronchioles , on_the_other_hand , appear to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type 2 , . In type 1 , the pulmonary_vein closely follows the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary_artery from the periphery to the hilum . This maybe due_to the heavy interlobular connective_tissue barriers present . In type 3 , this general relationship is maintained peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary_vein follows a more independent <head>path</head> to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2 , .</context>

      <context> The bronchus and pulmonary_artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . The pulmonary_vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct <head>path</head> to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) . Another marked difference is noted here . The pulmonary_artery , in_addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) . The bronchial_artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply .</context>

It was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church , a woman named Catt who , as Wilson afterward found , was briefly referred to as The_Cat because of her sharp_tongue and fierce initiative . Ann_Catt was a lonely , devoted soul , never married , conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church , but a perpetual dissenter and born critic . She soared over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the <head>path</head> and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository . Then Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition . The salary of the pastor had for years been $ 500 annually and even this was in_arrears . Wilson made_up_his_mind that he must receive at_least $ 2500 , but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said nothing .</context>
