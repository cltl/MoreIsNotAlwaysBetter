      <context> It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high_fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener . The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope since Feyer 's four-sided LP edition of 1958 for Angel ) , this set is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment . The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari 's melodramatic contrasts between ultra vehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality . And in its engineers ' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic <head>impact</head> and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super high_fidelity '' . The home listener is overpowered , all_right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one . As with the penultimate Giselle release ( Wolff 's abridgment for RCA_Victor ) I find the cleaner , less razor edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable - but this may be the result of processing defects in my SD copies .</context>

      <context> At what stage are social_sciences then ? Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud . And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their <head>impact</head> . Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man . Constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor_unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world_courts , and the veto power in world_councils are but a_few examples . Most_of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it .</context>

      <context> Meanwhile , other air_defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message . The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans . Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic_missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and deployed , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental_ballistic_missile . The <head>impact</head> of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the high energy fuel program . This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a high energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bombers . Continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel , coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the high energy fuel program . As a result , the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed .</context>

      <context> There have been contradictory reports from 1958 Delta_2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable . On May 15 , a very large increase occurred with * * f of mass between * * f and * * f ; for the next two days , the impact rate was * * f ; and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less_than * * f ( Nazarova , 1960 ) . The data for the first day indicate a meteor_stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux . Preliminary data from 1959_Eta give an average <head>impact</head> rate of * * f for masses larger than * * f for about 1000 events in a 22 - day period ( LaGow and Alexander , 1960 ) . The day-to-day rate varied by less_than a factor of 4.5 . The data have not_yet been analyzed for diurnal_variations . Note that the mass threshold is four_times that of 1958_Alpha and that the flux is one_fifth as large .</context>

      <context> Being based on so few events , these results are of dubious validity . The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in_terms_of the particle parameters is very uncertain . Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities . However , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity <head>impacts</head> would cause a deviation from a linear relationship . In the United_States , most_of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces . The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor . This `` ejection '' momentum is linearly related to the particle energy .</context>

      <context> This `` ejection '' momentum is linearly related to the particle energy . They quote about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater . There is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in_that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin . The threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean <head>impact</head> velocity of * * f in the U.S. work and * * f in the U.S.S.R. work . The threshold mass of about * * f corresponds to a 10 - | m diameter sphere of density * * f . However , the conversion from mass to size is unreliable , since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as * * f . To_what_extent such low_density applies to micrometeorites is unknown .</context>

      <context> There are several possible sources . According_to Whipple ( 1955 ) , cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state . Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material . It is also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic <head>impacts</head> upon the moon . One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space . Even in the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at_least four orders_of_magnitude . This large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved .</context>

      <context> Beyond a_few million kilometers from the Earth , but still in the region of the Earth 's orbit , a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable . At greater distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain . There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment . Direct information has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with <head>impact</head> sensors . In_addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain . From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal_light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane . Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component .</context>

      <context> The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth . The direct_evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the Earth is obtained from piezoelectric sensors ( essentially microphones ) and from wire gages ; these instruments are installed on rockets , satellites , and space_probes . Statistically , the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha ( Explorer_1 , ) , 1958 Delta_2 ( Sputnik 3 , ) , and 1959 Eta ( Vanguard 3 , ) . These vehicles , with large sensitive areas , have collected data for long enough times to give reliable <head>impact</head> rates for the periods of exposure . Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive area exposure time products contribute some information . The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was * * f for particles of mass greater than * * f ( Dubin , 1960 ) ; this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of * * f .
