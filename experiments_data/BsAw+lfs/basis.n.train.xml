      <context> `` Eve was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as_yet she was a virgin . And even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as_yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human_race ; so also did Mary , having a man betrothed [ to her ] , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human_race '' . Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no_doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' . His interpretation of the beginning on the <head>basis</head> of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary . That parallelism affects his picture of man 's disobedience too ; for as it was Christ , the Word_of_God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word_of_God in_the_beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe . With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality . At the nadir of that circuit is death .</context>

      <context> From the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real_Thing have regularly been put in circulation . Seen in perspective , many_of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones . Although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original . On the <head>basis</head> of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal under Karl_Muck 's baton , or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini created in his years with the New_York_Philharmonic . Since the concept of high_fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold .

      <context> Some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings . ( Music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat . ) From the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original . Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the <head>basis</head> of standard tests . Yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records . The sound may be good ; but if you know The Real_Thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation . Command 's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one .</context>

These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 <head>basis</head> . Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services . Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry_out the provisions of the Act . The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational_rehabilitation_program , providing_for a three part grant structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational_rehabilitation - and in_addition for short-term training and instruction .</context>

      <context> The Act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State . It stipulates , in_addition , that all amounts remaining as_a_result_of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums . These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per_capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State . The provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in State programs already in_operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the <head>basis</head> of wealth and population alone . The method used in computing the allotments is specifically set_forth in the Act . The term `` State '' means the several States , the District_of_Columbia , the Virgin_Islands , Guam and Puerto_Rico ; the term `` United_States '' includes the several States and the District_of_Columbia , and excludes the Virgin_Islands , Guam and Puerto_Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii .

      <context> This involves step-by-step progress , and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry . If of the founders of glottochronology Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding , and Lees has repudiated his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should swerve . There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by Swadesh 's rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown so vast . It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble , solid , and limited <head>basis</head> . I would propose , first , an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved . I would propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible . There would be no conceivable sense in going_to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable .</context>

      <context> Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked_out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being . Thus , besides the training provided to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts . Few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry . The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad_hoc flexible <head>basis</head> to subsidize any local preemployment_training_programs that my be quickly set_up in a community to aid a new industrial plant . The major weakness of vocational training_programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands . This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country . Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained_workers .</context>

      <context> Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . Some vocational training_schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes_Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching <head>basis</head> , state administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home_economics . Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . The George-Barden_Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in_addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith_Act . The Health_Amendment_Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical_nurse training .</context>

      <context> Dice , for_example , he inferred from black dots on a white surface . He evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects , but their size and the dots gave them away . And the authors give numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient 's part to show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself and how proficient he became at it . Often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly , without the tracing motions , solely on the <head>basis</head> of qualitative differences among the blot like things which appeared in his visual experience . Perhaps the very important question - What is , then , exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the patient 's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things ? - has now been raised in the reader 's mind and in the following form . If the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense_of_touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in_independence_of visual representations , at_least in regard_to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on_the_part_of unaided touch is denied by the authors .</context>

      <context> These local variations were to become ever sharper in the next century and a half . The same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark_ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the survivals of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages . By 800 B.C. the Aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture . On these pillars rested that solid <head>basis</head> for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the Iliad . Everywhere within the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; Greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized , and plagued , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors . Further we cannot go , for the Dark_ages deserve their name . Many aspects of civilization were not_yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure .</context>

      <context> Efforts were made to take the grab_samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6 - hr composite sample . A single 24 - hr composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical . The BOD of the influent to the pilot plant varied between 110 and 710 mg / l with an average of 350 mg / l . This was equivalent_to 240 mg / l BOD on a 24 - hr <head>basis</head> . The BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision . The BOD in the effluent averaged 58 mg / l , a 76 - per_cent reduction over the 24 - hr period .

His files , desk , drafting_board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos .

Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved .
