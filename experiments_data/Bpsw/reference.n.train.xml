Electrical literature contained numerous <head>references</head> to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles . In the late 1700 's Beccaria and van_Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it . Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden_jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch spring steel making its ends magnetic . The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise .</context>

      <context> All such imitations of negative quality have given_rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at_least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak_to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved . The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems . Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually_exclusive , that they belong together . Without the decay of a sense of objective <head>reference</head> ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being . And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written . For better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . A broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcends the non artistic causal_factors out of which it arises .</context>

      <context> Let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought - turning our attention from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades . We may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts . Finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at_present widespread . No one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent <head>reference</head> to them . Still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature . The actual moments of contact are vitally important . These moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative_literature must be frequently concerned .</context>

      <context> An idea , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned . In this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas , that are so_to_speak `` writ_large '' in history of literature where they recur continually . Outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself , including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries ; also secondary notions such_as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man . One might , indeed , argue that the history of ideas , in_so_far as it includes the literatures , must center_on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by <head>reference</head> to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning . We need not , to_be_sure , expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature . An idea , of the sort that we have_in_mind , although of_necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images , especially those appearing in lyric_poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience . Thus Burns 's `` My love is like a red , red rose '' and Hopkins ' `` The thunder-purple sea beach , plumed purple of thunder '' although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned .</context>

      <context> As I have been intimating , in the schizophrenic - and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic ; this is a question which I have no wish to take_up - condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well sorted_out , but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well differentiated from one another . Freeman , Cameron and McGhie , in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard_to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation '' . In my experience , a great many_of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience .

Recently , for_example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was . Or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a simile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking .
