Toying_with her field in the early stages , Garden_Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip_Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3 - 5 for the 7 furlongs . Richard_M._Forbes 's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in_front of Glen_T._Hallowell 's Milties_Miss . A bright sun and brisk <head>wind</head> had the track in a fast condition for_the_first_time this week and 8280 St._Patty_Day celebrants bet $ 842617 on the well prepared program . Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James_P._Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . Garden_Fresh , the result of a mating of Better_Self and Rosy_Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St._Patrick's_Day_Purse with some speed in reserve . She was moving_up to the allowance department after winning a $ 10000 claiming event .</context>

      <context> In recent years many counties and the U._S._Forest_Service have taken aerial photos which show features in_detail and are very good for planning use . Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor 's office showing ownerships of land . Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation . This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and <head>wind</head> , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons . It is usually helpful to make a sketch_map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site . These are a great aid for planning use back at the office . For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry_through the study .</context>

      <context> The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards_of_measurement . An ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a_few hundred feet long from crest to crest - no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1000 feet in the Pacific . But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest . While a <head>wind</head> wave never travels at more than 60 miles_per_hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles_per_hour . The greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave ; Lagrange 's law says that its velocity is equal to the square_root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due_to gravity . In the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles_per_hour . Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable .</context>

      <context> I must add at_once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold_weather . Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50 ` F and there is not too_much <head>wind</head> . Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a_couple_of those wonderful flowering currants such_as the red Ribes_sanguineum of our Pacific_Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy_willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins .
