      <context> In <head>the</head> context of a relational database , a row—also called a record or tuple—represents a single , implicitly structured data item in a table . In simple terms , a database table can be thought of as consisting of rows and columns or fields . Each row in a table represents a set of related data , and every row in the table has the same structure .</context>

      <context> In <head>a</head> less formal usage , e.g. for a database which is not formally relational , a record is equivalent to a row as described above , but is not usually referred to as a row .

The row is then interpreted as a relvar composed of a set of tuples , with each tuple consisting of the two items : the name of the relevant column and the value this row provides for that column .</context>

      <context> The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down ; the trees ' shadows circled from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn . At four o_'_clock , or four thirty , the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day ; he tossed a paper toward every front_door , and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing . The streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer ; they were like this fifty odd years ago , and yesterday . But the fences were still in_place fifty odd years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two <head>rows</head> of paving_stones with grass between and on both sides . The curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees . Opposite every gate was a hitching_post or a stone carriage step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse . The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center ; it was mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping_stones .</context>

      <context> In these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress . To the ancestral lore , however , new materials were added . Painters left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color ; instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns into which freehand drawing began to creep . Wavy lines , feather like patterns , rosettes of indefinitely floral nature , birds either singly or in stylized <head>rows</head> , animals in solemn frieze bands ( see Plates 11 - 12 ) - all these turned_up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze . The rows of animals and birds , in_particular , suggest awareness of Oriental animal friezes , transmitted perhaps via Syrian silver bowls and textiles , but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless Greek . Though the spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not_yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the Cyclades , which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century . As the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident .</context>
