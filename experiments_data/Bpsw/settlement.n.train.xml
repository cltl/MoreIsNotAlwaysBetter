      <context> Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , he purchased great blocks of the Company's stock with the view to controlling its policies .

The grant , which stretched southward to Lake_Traverse - the headwaters of the Red - was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York_Factory on Hudson_Bay .

To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company 's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain_from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . With their customary source of supply cut_off , the Fort_Garry free_traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country . Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St._Paul and goods from St._Paul to Red_River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British <head>settlement</head> . This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per_cent after February 1835 , but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per_cent on the initiative of the London committee . The trade in a_few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49 th parallel .</context>

      <context> Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116000 square_miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . The grant , which stretched southward to Lake_Traverse - the headwaters of the Red - was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York_Factory on Hudson_Bay . Thus at the same time that William_Henry_Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana_Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North_American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier . Seven hundred miles south of York_Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a <head>settlement</head> in August 1812 . By October the little colony about Fort_Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 . Within a_few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called Meurons . The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great_Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War_of_1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 .</context>

      <context> The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great_Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War_of_1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go_to Red_River where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest_Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire . The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the <head>settlement</head> southward . When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river . Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort_Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland . The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort_Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food .</context>

His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red_River and from Selkirk's <head>settlement</head> he brought them south in carts . These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander_Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk colony was begun . In 1802 Henry referred to `` our new carts '' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much_as a horse could pack . They were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills .</context>

      <context> In September 1817 at Fort_Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of Sioux , he escorted to Prairie_du_Chien . During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United_States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red_River and that the United_States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England . Upon arriving_at Baltimore , Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John_Quincy_Adams , Secretary_of_State at Washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois_Territories '' . This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at_first , would increase with the progress of our <head>Settlements</head> '' . The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop_into a trade_route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected . In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the Forks '' ( Fort_Douglas ) and in December 1819 , twenty men left Fort_Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie_du_Chien . It was a three month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats .</context>
