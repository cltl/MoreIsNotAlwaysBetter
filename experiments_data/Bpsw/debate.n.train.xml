Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day_schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . There was no <head>debate</head> as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . It would authorize the Texas_Education_Agency to establish county-wide day_schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of_age to attend the day_schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas_School_for_the_Deaf here . Operating_budget for the day_schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El_Paso would be $ 451500 , which would be a savings of $ 157460 yearly after the first year 's capital outlay of $ 88000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate . The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day_school in Dallas_County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school .</context>
