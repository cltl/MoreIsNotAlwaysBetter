      <context> <head>The</head> Linux kernel has a number of CPU frequency governors , which are a sort of policies that set the CPU frequency based on the selected governor and usage patterns . For example , when the " performance " governor is active , the CPU frequency will be set to its maximum value , the " powersave " governor sets the CPU to its lowest frequency , the " ondemand " governor sets the CPU frequency depending on the current usage , etc .

      <context> To reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the region of the arc , a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder . In_addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum_foil to reduce radiation . Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water_cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account_for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug . The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure <head>regulator</head> and measured with a gas flow rator . The power source was a commercial D.C. rectifier . At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less_than 0.5 V ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load . The current was regulated by_means_of a variable_resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter .</context>
