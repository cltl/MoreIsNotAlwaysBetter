      <context> For we have said , in_effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative . If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' is clearly untenable . Whereas Bultmann 's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl_Barth , involves the rejection or at_least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered . It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general <head>viewpoint</head> of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . To do this , it is sufficient to point_out that if the principle in_terms_of which alternatives are to be conceived is such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question .</context>

      <context> But people differ in their religious_beliefs on scores of doctrines , without taking_up_arms against those who disagree with them . Why is it so different in regard_to birth_control ? It is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at_least the practical consequences thereof , upon others . It is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched_fist of the law its creedal <head>viewpoint</head> upon others . Both Roman_Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past . Consider what happened during World_War_1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress . Many_of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful .</context>

      <context> Up_to the turn_of_the_century , contraception was condemned by all Christian_churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine_law . This was generally reflected in the civil_laws of Christian countries . Today , the Roman_Catholic and Orthodox_Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction . The various Lambeth_Conferences , expressing the Anglican <head>viewpoint</head> , mirror the gradual change that has taken_place among Protestants generally . In 1920 , the Lambeth_Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together_with the grave dangers - physical , moral , and religious - thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' . Denouncing the view that the sexual_union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded_as the governing considerations of Christian marriage . One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' .</context>

      <context> The general board declared : `` Most_of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right . The general Protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' . An action once universally condemned by all Christian_churches and forbidden by the civil_law is now not_only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant_denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty . This <head>viewpoint</head> has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country . Repeated polls have disclosed that most married_couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth_control . For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment .</context>

      <context> Where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment . The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation . The first_step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good_will and friendly communication on other_than the polemical level . Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite <head>viewpoint</head> and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached . `` All_too frequently '' , points_out James_O'_Gara , managing_editor of Commonweal , `` Catholics run_roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth_control has changed in recent decades '' . All_too often our language is unduly harsh . The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family_planning .</context>

      <context> A friend of mine in New_Mexico said the Court_order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell . He seemed a_little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere . I murmured something about a possible difference between New_Mexico 's history and Mississippi 's . One can meet_with aloofness almost anywhere : the Thank-Heaven-We 're_-_not-Involved <head>viewpoint</head> , It Does n't Affect Us ! Southern Liberals ( there are a_good_many ) - especially if they 're rich - often exhibit blithe insouciance . The trouble here is that it 's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it does n't cost you anything . You 've already sent your daughter to Miss_X 's select academy for girls and your son to Mr._Y 's select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity .</context>

      <context> But the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent . The second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower 's Commission_on_National_Goals , titled Goals_For_Americans . They , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower requested that the Commission be administered by the American_Assembly_of_Columbia_University , because it was non-partisan . The Commission seems to represent the <head>viewpoint</head> of_what I would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism . And here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above : `` The paramount goal of the United_States , set long_ago , was to guard the rights of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity '' . This group is secularist and their program tends to be technological . But it is the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as symptom of the common_man 's malaise .</context>

      <context> One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1 , or 2 , . The presence of normally occurring bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch , and thereafter by many others . Nakamura ( ' 58 ) , Verloop ( ' 48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ( ' 50 ) , von_Hayek ( ' 53 ) , and Tobin ( ' 52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human_being . Miller ( ' 50 ) is the principal antagonist of this <head>viewpoint</head> . In criticism of the latter 's views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all_of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level . As early as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial_artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary_artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial_artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary_artery pressure . Berry , Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this .</context>

      <context> Berry , Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this . Our own studies in which bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by injecting the bronchial_artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary_artery or vein , and then by injecting the pulmonary_artery and vein afterwards . It is distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence , uninjectable . This <head>viewpoint</head> is further supported by Verloop 's ( ' 48 ) demonstration of thickened bronchial_artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting_as valves . In_other_words , the anastomoses between the bronchial_artery and pulmonary_artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts . In_addition , little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard_to the normal existence of bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses . Verloop ( ' 48 ; ' 49 ) found these shunts in the human_being but was unable to find them in rats .</context>

      <context> Each of the n trials is either a success or a failure . `` Success '' and `` failure '' are just convenient labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk_about binomial trials in_general . These words are more expressive than labels like `` A '' and `` not - A '' . It is natural from the marksman 's <head>viewpoint</head> to call a bull's-eye a success , but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse . The word `` binomial '' means `` of two names '' or `` of two terms '' , and both usages apply in our work : the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial , and the second to the terms p and * * f that represent the probabilities of `` success '' and `` failure '' . Sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial , we group these outcomes into two classes , as in the example of the die , where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes `` ace '' and `` not ace '' . We classify mice as `` straight haired '' or `` wavy haired '' , but a hairless mouse appears .</context>

      <context> The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; as a complex it fits into the whole social_organization and functions dominantly in every part of_it . In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . With the diversity of religious <head>viewpoints</head> , there are differences_of_opinion as to the essential features of religion ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . Nevertheless , for most_of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social_organization , they have important indirect consequences . If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows .</context>
