      <context> Pelham pointed_out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . A veteran Jackson_County legislator will ask the Georgia_House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . Rep._Mac_Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided_that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some <head>members</head> of our congressional delegation in Washington who would_like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday . It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the State_Board_of_Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises .</context>

      <context> It is to this same tradition that most_of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong . For we must number here not_only the names of Bushnell , Clarke , and Rauschenbusch , not_to_mention those of `` the Chicago_School '' and Macintosh , but those of the brothers Niebuhr and ( if America may claim him ! ) Tillich as_well . Finally , we may also mention the several <head>members</head> of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that developed at the University_of_Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred_North_Whitehead . What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged_to it have been profoundly in_earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern_world . Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity . They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked_upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .</context>

      <context> In_fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann 's argument is disclosed . Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence . This is especially in_evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle_class . Time_and_again in counseling and teaching , one encounters <head>members</head> of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern_world are only_too painfully obvious . The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture Protestantism '' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches . In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at_hand - and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation . This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman_Vincent_Peale 's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel .</context>

      <context> One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken_place since the mid 19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge_Universities . At Oxford one_hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 . Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs . Now , not_only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious_orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non_Catholic <head>members</head> of the University . Some Catholic priests lecture there ; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students . Further evidence that Roman_Catholicism enjoys a more favorable_position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to_it in the mass_media of England . The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester_Guardian and the Sunday_Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic_Church is now at_least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches .</context>

A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city_university , following Anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated Mass before more_than a_hundred . The Protestants themselves are the first to admit the great falling_off in effective membership in their churches . According_to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church_of_England , the `` total of confirmed <head>members</head> is 9748000 , but only 2887671 are registered on the parochial church_rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church_of_England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' .

      <context> In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have_to be tied to the issue by argument . One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages . Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell_into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism . Yes , he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of_course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; but he believed in the Jew as enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a <head>member</head> of a cult speculating on the nature of things . The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of_this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . In regard_to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of_this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer .</context>

The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward .</context>

      <context> The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit '' of Protestant religious life ; in_fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal '' Roman_Catholic parish . We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection . The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . This fact is evident in the recruitment of new <head>members</head> . The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations . There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism .</context>

The new Council was itself inescapably of political meaning , which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U.N.F.P. <head>members</head> and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders . Since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections , and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the U.N.F.P. Voting preparations began in the fall of 1959 , although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes was completed in 1958 . There were three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of voters and the registration of candidates .</context>

      <context> As we have noted , however , we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate . The level of average_cost ( equal to marginal_cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate . The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership , and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate . The union does not regard unemployment of its own <head>members</head> as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy - its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment . The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases , but we abstract from these forces here . For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs . Productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time_period is not even well_known to the industry , much_less to the union or to the public .</context>
