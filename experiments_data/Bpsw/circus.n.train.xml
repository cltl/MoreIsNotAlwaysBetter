      <context> An example of this type is <head>the</head> Stadium of Domitian . === Dates === Differently from other major Roman structures circuses frequently evolved over long periods of time from a simple track in a field , through generations of wooden seating structures ( frequently destroyed by fire or rot ) , before they finally began to be converted to stone .</context>

      <context> The comparative dimensions of a circus <head>may</head> be measured in 2 basic ways : by the length of the track , and by the seating capacity . Other dimensions , such as the external dimensions of the structure may vary considerably depending on the location , the site , and on specific architectural characteristics . The simplest comparative measurement of a circus is its track length .</context>

      <context> According to Edward Gibbon , in <head>Chapter</head> XXXI of his work The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , the Roman people , at the start of the 5th century : ... still considered the Circus as their home , their temple , and the seat of the republic . The performance space of the Roman circus was normally , despite its name , an oblong rectangle of two linear sections of race track , separated by a median strip running along the length of about two thirds the track , joined at one end with a semicircular section and at the other end with an undivided section of track closed ( in most cases ) by a distinctive starting gate known as the carceres , thereby creating a circuit for the races .</context>

    <instance id="Circus_(building)-circus-8-41-1" docsrc="Circus_(building)">
      <context> The carceres were designed for the races to <head>be</head> run round the spina in an anticlockwise direction . The form of the carceres appears to have been standardised throughout the Roman world . The similarity in form among the carceres of circuses of many different sizes suggests that carceres were constructed according to a series of proportional mathematical relationships or formulas .</context>

    <instance id="Circus_(building)-circus-9-24-3" docsrc="Circus_(building)">
      <context> This is the most easily measured dimension , as <head>it</head> only requires small excavations at either end of the centreline . It is very probable that this can be done even when the circus is buried under subsequent constructions . Track lengths may vary from the 245m of the circus at Gerasa ( Jordan ) , to the 621m of the Circus Maximus ( Italy ) .</context>

      <context> But time is running_out , and many_of Stravinsky 's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra_firma . His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a_house_divided_against_itself : Supra_Expressionism , Neo Paganism , Neo_Classicism , Neo_Romanticism , Neo_Jazz , Neo Ecclesiasticism , Neo Popularism , and most_recently , Post Serialism - all competing with each other within one composer ! What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist ; a maladroit reharmonization of our National_Anthem ( The Star-Spangled_Banner ) ; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ; a <head>circus</head> polka for elephants ; his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs ! Stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home . How differently Prokofieff 's life unfolded . Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction .</context>
