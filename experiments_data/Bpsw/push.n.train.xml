      <context> As you can see , in this Push-Pull_Super_Set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises , so the complete torso remains pumped-up all_the_time ! Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 1 , the professor allows him about a five minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 2 . Super-Set No. 2 is made_up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat_benches . The `` <head>push</head> '' exercise of this Push-Pull_Super-Set is the Bench_Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation . You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs . The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the pecs . The `` pull '' exercise in this Super-Set is the one dumbbell Bent-Arm_Pullover .</context>

      <context> The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the pecs . The `` pull '' exercise in this Super-Set is the one dumbbell Bent-Arm_Pullover . ( Note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin_point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) . In the third Push-Pull_Super-Set the `` <head>push</head> '' exercise is the wide grip Pushup_Between_Bars , while the `` pull '' exercise is the Moon_Bench_Lateral_Raise with bent arms . The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral rib_cage stretcher ever invented ! This is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved . You 'll know when you 've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder_blades will touch !</context>

      <context> Do this exercise six times each class period . As strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward . Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out . Try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate <head>pushes</head> from the hands . The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide . Let the body down slowly , taking at_least five seconds for the letting_down . Five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up .</context>

      <context> This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather_than the highroad . The cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not named but identified simply as `` Life '' - that and a license_number , which Piepsam uses in addressing him . `` Life '' points_out that `` everybody uses this path '' , and starts to ride on . Piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a <head>push</head> in the chest from `` Life '' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather . His rage assumes a religious form ; that_is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life - not_only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as_well : `` all you light-headed breed '' . This passion brings_on a fit which proves fatal . Then an ambulance comes_along , and they drive Praisegod_Piepsam away .</context>

      <context> Synthetic_Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this was the_point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it . But even before that , Picasso had glimpsed and entered , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him . It was as though , in_that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all_the_way back - or forward - to literal three-dimensionality . This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward <head>push</head> of the collage ( and of Cubism in_general ) literally into the literal space in_front of the picture_plane . Some time in 1912 , Picasso cut_out and folded a piece_of_paper in the shape of a guitar ; to this he glued and fitted other pieces_of_paper and four taut strings , thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture_plane . The affixed elements of collage were extruded , as_it_were , and cut_off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief .</context>
