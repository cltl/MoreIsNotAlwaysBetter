      <context> Mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown_season , 1959 , when he batted .365 and also led the American_League in home_runs , 52 , and RBIs , 130 . Like the Yankees ' slugger , Mays , the terror of the Giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by - or for - Willie . His best years were 1954 when he hit .345 with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home_runs , drove_in 127 and stole 24 bases . Now , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect <head>players</head> , are behaving as though they 're going_to pass those previous peaks . Yes , we know , they 're professionals , men paid to play , and they should n't care how they 're handled , just as_long_as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each_month . The truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment . For_that_matter , Stan_Musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put_out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort .</context>

      <context> Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 . The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New_York 's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . They honored the battling Billikens last night . Speakers at a Tipoff_Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St._Louis_University <head>players</head> who , in the words of Coach_John_Benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' . The most_valuable_player award was split three ways , among Glen_Mankowski , Gordon_Hartweger and Tom_Kieffer . In_addition , a special award was given to Bob_(_Bevo_) Nordmann , the 6 - foot - 10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury . `` You often hear people talk_about team_spirit and that sort of thing '' , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a_little different .</context>

      <context> The occasion for this marathon : Angel 's long awaited reissue in its `` Great_Recordings_of_the_Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro_Arte version . Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . Whether considered alone or in_relation_to other editions , COLH 40 is a document of prime importance . Artur_Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart <head>players</head> of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable . But Schnabel was a great teacher in_addition_to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford_Curzon , Frank_Glazer , Adrian_Aeschbacher , and Victor_Babin ) also sheds_light_on the master 's pedagogical skills . Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in_that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) . But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel 's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student 's approach as distinctly his own .</context>

      <context> The lyric beauties of Schubert 's Trout_Quintet - its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies - make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners . But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems . Since it requires only five <head>players</head> , it would seem to fall_into the category of chamber_music - yet it calls_for a double_bass , an instrument generally regarded_as symphonic . Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather_than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing . Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free_rein .</context>
