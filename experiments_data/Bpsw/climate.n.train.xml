      <context> In recent years many counties and the U._S._Forest_Service have taken aerial photos which show features in_detail and are very good for planning use . Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor 's office showing ownerships of land . Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation . This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the <head>climate</head> conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons . It is usually helpful to make a sketch_map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site . These are a great aid for planning use back at the office . For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry_through the study .</context>

      <context> Prokofieff 's Classical_Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well trained musician still in his twenties . To the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; to the Neo Classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world . What was it to Prokofieff ? A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18_th Century ideas ; a trial_balloon to test the aesthetic <head>climate</head> of the times ; a brilliant piece_de_resistance ? Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon . I heard the Classical_Symphony for_the_first_time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927 . All musical Paris was there .</context>

In analyzing the watercolors of Roy_Mason , the first thing that comes_to_mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of atmosphere and <head>climate</head> . Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; a middle_distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey .</context>

Alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal <head>climate</head> in which to begin battle and bloodshed . Their strategy was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by Philip_Spencer 's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated . When the mast was raised , Alexander gave the order for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers . Spencer 's potential followers were openly sullen and morose , missing muster without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons , communicating with the three by glance and signal .</context>
