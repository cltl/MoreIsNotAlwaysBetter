      <context> But not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the Hawaiian_Islands did not exceed $ 800000 . There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage . But it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough . In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be <head>restrictions</head> against building homes on exposed coasts , or at_least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves . The key to the world of geology is change ; nothing remains the same . Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man . The land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of_this .</context>

      <context> Under modern conditions , this is especially true of the ready reserve . I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in_relation_to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare . Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army_Reserve . Similar <head>restrictions</head> on the strength of the Army National_Guard contained in the 1960 Department_of_Defense Appropriation_Act should likewise be dropped . I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . I again proposed a reduction in the Army National_Guard and Army_Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal_year 1961 . These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives .</context>

In an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulating the bone_marrow and controlling any hemolytic component , triamcinolone , 16 mg. daily , was begun on Sept. 26 , 1958 , and continued until Feb. 18 , 1959 .</context>

      <context> In the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares . This theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in **f . The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in **f there are families of such cubes . Here , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the <head>restriction</head> to convexity and give certain other results . A square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may_not lie entirely in the interior of C . Indeed , the spiral **f , with the two endpoints connected by a straight_line possesses only one inscribed square . The square has one corner point on the straight_line segment , and does not lie entirely in the interior .</context>

      <context> The final sample was not significantly different from a normal_distribution in regard_to reading achievement or intelligence_test scores . Twenty-four classrooms in twelve unstructured schools furnished 156 cases , 87 boys and 69 girls . Eight classrooms in three structured schools furnished 72 cases , 36 boys and 36 girls . Administrative <head>restrictions</head> necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools . It was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with_respect_to the personality variables under investigation . An interview schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepared , and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home . The parent was asked to describe the child 's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self and others , irrational conformity to rules , orderliness , punctuality , and need for certainty .</context>

      <context> Indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific . In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliament - the elected representatives - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary . When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit - when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands - two purposes were served : Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law became a rational system for implementing that will , for serving conscious goals , for embodying the `` public policy '' . It is true that , initially , the task was to remove <head>restrictions</head> that , it was thought , inhibited the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy . Law was seen as an emanation of the `` sovereign will '' . However , the sovereign was not Hobbes ' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin . It was , too , an optimistic philosophy , and , though it separated law from morality , it was by_no_means an immoral or amoral one .</context>
