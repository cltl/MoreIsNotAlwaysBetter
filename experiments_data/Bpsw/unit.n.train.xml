Although the * * f calculation is obvious by_analogy_with that for gravitational_field and osmotic_pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects .

If * * f is the change per <head>unit</head> volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and |r is the density of the fluid , then the total potential_energy of the system above the reference height is * * f . * * f is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h . The total volume of the system above the reference height is * * f , and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential_energy of the system in_terms_of H . The minimum total potential_energy is found by taking the derivative with_respect_to H and equating to zero .</context>

The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data . A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table 5 - 1 . From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each <head>unit</head> increase in magnitude .

Since tone_systems typically comprise fewer <head>units</head> than either consonant or vowel_systems , we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis .

Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there . Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities .
