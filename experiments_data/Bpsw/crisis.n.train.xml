      <context> It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine . After_all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control . Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement . Such identification comes for each group in each <head>crisis</head> by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes . In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose . A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever_changing land . But we must never forget , most_of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends .</context>

      <context> Even so astute a commentator as Harold_Clurman of The Nation has said that `` Waiting_for_Godot '' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair '' . But to me Beckett 's writing had seemed permeated with love for human_beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism . Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ? Is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social <head>crises</head> we face ? Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ? I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing : in_the_last_analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself .

Life is further characterized , in antithesis to Piepsam , as animal : the image of a dog , which appears at several places , is first given as the criterion of amiable , irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle : a dog in a wagon is `` admirable '' , `` a pleasure to contemplate '' ; another wagon has no dog , and therefore is `` devoid_of interest '' .

      <context> Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each_day has increased tremendously since World_War_2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957 . Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New_York_City area .

At this time of <head>crisis</head> in our Nation 's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New_York_Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake_+_Ohio_Railroad 's proposal for control of the Baltimore_+_Ohio_railroads .

      <context> The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 , but the P.D.I. ( Parti_Democratique_de_l'Independance ) , the most important minor party at the time , objected to the Istiqlal 's predominance in the civil_service and influence in Radio_Maroc . There were rumors that the Ministry_of_the_Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings . The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be supported by the King himself . The Ifni <head>crisis</head> in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called_in and notices of further investigation appeared from_time_to_time . In January , 1958 , the Minister_of_the_Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied . In late 1957 the M.P.

They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held . But the eagerly sought `` homogeneity '' of the Balafrej Council_of_Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled over foreign_policy , labor politics and economic development .

      <context> During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration_of_Independence .

The Providence_Daily_Journal answered the Daily_Post by stating that the raid of John_Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican_Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' . The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the <head>crisis</head> , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history .

      <context> The Albany_Civic_Opera 's presentation of Spumoni 's immortal Il_Sevigli_del_Spegititgninino , with guest contralto Hattie_Sforzt . An unusual , if not extraordinary , rendering of the classic myth that involves the rescue of Prometheus from the rock by the U.S._Cavalry was given last week in the warehouse of the Albany_Leather_Conduit_Company amid cheers of `` Hubba hubba '' and `` Yalagaloo pip pip '' ! After a `` busy '' overture , the curtain rises on a farm scene - the Ranavan_Valley in northern Maine . A dead armadillo , the sole occupant of the stage , symbolizes the <head>crisis</head> and destruction of the Old_Order . Old_Order , acted and atonally sung by Grunnfeu_Arapacis , the lovely Serbantian import , then entered and delivered the well-known invocation to the god Phineoppus , whereupon the stage is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering Gorshek priests , symbolizing Love , Lust , Prudence and General_Motors , respectively . According to the myth , Old_Order then vanishes at stage_left and reappears at extreme stage_right , but director Shuz skillfully sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage_effects by simply having Miss_Arapacis walk across the stage . The night we saw it , a rather unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the armadillo , complaining - in ad-lib - that `` it smelled '' .</context>
