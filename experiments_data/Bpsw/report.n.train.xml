      <context> Until 1924 O_'_Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North_Side domain solidly Democratic . There was a question and answer gag that went_around at that time : Q. `` Who 'll carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards '' ? A. `` O_'_Banion , in his pistol pocket '' . But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine <head>reports</head> that O_'_Banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans . To forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O_'_Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay . The reception was held in a private dining_room of the Webster_Hotel on Lincoln_Park_West . It was an interesting fraternisation of ex convicts , union racketeers , ward_heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen .</context>

      <context> On November 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka_Peninsula . At 17_:_07 that afternoon ( Greenwich_time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu . The warning system immediately went into action . Within about an hour with the help of <head>reports</head> from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake 's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude . While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came_in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military_services and the police that the first big wave would arrive_at Honolulu at 23_:_30 Greenwich_time . It turned_out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 . They hurled a cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu_Harbor , knocked_down telephone_lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows .</context>

      <context> Today 's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth 's restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them . The effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized . The role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster . Superstition has often blended with fact to color <head>reports</head> . We have learned from earthquakes much of_what we now know about the earth 's interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled . These waves have shown that 1800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in_turn , has a solid inner core . Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths .</context>

The suburban high_school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high_school because of the absence of vocational_programs . The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community . Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high_school described in my first <head>report</head> . The separate vocational or technical high_schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions .

I should_like to underline four points I made in my first <head>report</head> with respect_to vocational education . First_and_foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic_program for graduation . Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more_than half the student 's time in those years ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought_to begin earlier . Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time .</context>

      <context> There are three levels on which to treat the subject . The first is the strictly scientific , which demands concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in_the_flesh . This approach rejects virtually all field measurements . The next level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced , sensible conclusion ; field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected , and even <head>reports</head> of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated . The third level leans_on a belief that a_lot of smoke means some fire . The argument against this last approach is comparable_to that which rejects stories about hoop_snakes , about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again , or even of ghosts that chase people out of graveyards ; the mere piling_up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of hoop_snakes , joint_snakes , or ghosts . Oliver has recently used the second level approach with the largest snakes , and has come to these conclusions :</context>

      <context> Thus , his estimate lies between Oliver 's suggestion of at_least 37 feet and the 50 - foot `` monstrous freaks '' intimated by Heuvelmans . The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern Colombia by Roberto_Lamon , a petroleum_geologist of the Richmond_Oil_Company , and reported in 1944 by Emmett_R_._Dunn . However , as a field measurement , it is open_to question . Oliver 's 37 - 1 2 feet is partly based on this <head>report</head> and can be accepted as probable . However , many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 feet .

      <context> When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing . Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easier than to the downtown department_store , though both are the same distance from home . Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown . Raymond_Vernon <head>reports</head> that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the lot next_door . If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened_away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program . And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble .</context>
