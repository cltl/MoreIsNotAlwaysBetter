Most software used for cricket scoring uses a form at the front end with buttons for the scorer to press to record ball by ball events .</context>

      <context> Traditionally , the score book might record each ball bowled by a bowler and each ball faced by a batsman , but not <head>necessarily</head> which batsman faced which ball . Linear scoring systems were developed from the late 19th century and early 20th century by John Atkinson Pendlington , Bill Ferguson and Bill Frindall , to keep track of the balls faced by a batsman off each bowler . Another early method of recording the number of balls faced and runs scored by each batsman off each bowler was devised by Australian scorer J.G. Jackschon in the 1890s , using a separate memorandum alongside the main scoresheet .</context>
