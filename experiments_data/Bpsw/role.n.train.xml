Here is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement .

The latter plays a prominent <head>role</head> in Roman_Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods . The Roman_Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end . This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God 's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements . Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race .</context>

There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world .</context>

One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the <head>role</head> of the B-70 , a long range supersonic bomber . This aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic_missile systems , all_of which are scheduled to become available earlier . The first Atlas ICBM 's are now operational , the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar_year , and the first Titan ICBM 's next year . The Minuteman solid fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about mid 1963 .</context>

Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army_Reserve .

I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . I again proposed a reduction in the Army National_Guard and Army_Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal_year 1961 . These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential <head>roles</head> and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives . - About 30 % of the expenditures for the Department_of_Defense in 1961 are for military_personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel . These expenditures are estimated to be $ 12.1 billion , an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social_security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) . Retired pay costs are increased by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel .</context>

      <context> In other studies , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned_reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatments , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes . It has further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ( 2 ) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned_reactions ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned_stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned_reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing ( alerting ) effect on the EEG . These are few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned_reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes . The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial <head>role</head> at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion . If this is the case , one would expect that not_only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional_state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise . We pointed_out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic_disorders and neurotic symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( `` abreaction '' ) may cure a battle neurosis . This phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may_not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses .</context>
