      <context> On_the_other_hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; no client would ever think_of asking him to do such things . Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private_eye ends_up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder . Operating as a one_man police_force in fact if not in_name , he is at_once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves . He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a <head>fee</head> at_all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished . Thus the fictional detective is much more_than a simple businessman . He is , first_and_foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society . It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts_for the great appeal of the mythological detective .</context>
