We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers . Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist <head>dollars</head> of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms . So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting_grounds of `` Uncle_Sam '' ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought .

Trig was one of the five volunteers . The patrol snaked around in back of the cave , approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls . You could hear them from our outpost .</context>

      <context> `` Nothing 's free in the whole goddam world '' , was all I could think_of to say . When I 'd delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink . `` I am '' , she said . I 'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky_Derby and how it was Thelma 's fifty <head>dollars</head> I was spending . It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used_to in the old days , and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch . Drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me . I was crazy about her all over_again .</context>

I raised some kale by hocking the good clothes I had left_over from my respectable uptown life , but when that was gone I did n't have a cent .

Of_course I had_to give her Eileen 's address , but she never came_near us . All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever . She never said a word about the fifty <head>dollars</head> . She added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking . I must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times . Afterwards I learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband away .</context>

      <context> The contributions were ahead_of what she had got the previous year , and while the money , of_course , was not hers , it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks . She stopped at the Surcliffes ' after dusk , and had a Scotch-and-soda . She stayed too late , and when she left , it was dark and time to go_home and cook supper for her husband . `` I got a_hundred and sixty <head>dollars</head> for the hepatitis fund '' , she said excitedly when he walked in . `` I did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans .

      <context> My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when '' ; and_others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commencing again her piano_lessons , her private_school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe . In my letters I took_on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real_life . Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after_school class I was enrolled . The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young_man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot_Sands - he of the porch steps anecdotes - who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty <head>dollar</head> suits , and sneaked_off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them . Like Eliot , in my fantasies , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night 's climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love . The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle - it must have been late in September - I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and bloody , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life . For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in_that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie_awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep .</context>

      <context> It was nine o_'_clock in the morning : the hour which , like a spade turning clods of earth , exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain_dormant in the quiet night . Mission_Street at this hour was populated by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his tour of duty - the neighborhood that had known Urbano_Quintana by day . Sol_Phillips had purchased the Alliance_Furniture_Mart seventeen years ago . It was professedly worth three thousand <head>dollars</head> in stock and good_will , and the name was written in gold in foot high letters across each of the two display_windows . On the right window , at eye level , in smaller print but also in gold , was Gonzalez , Prop. , and under_that , Se_Habla_Espanol . Mr._Phillips took a razor to Gonzalez , Prop. , but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele would be welcome . Language was no problem anyway ; Mr._Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of Mission_Street .</context>

      <context> We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted . It may have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it did n't prevent the paintings from being exciting . He also had , at_times , an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker ; he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For_Christ's_sake , Donald , you 've got Prussian_blue all_over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all_over his pants as_well .
