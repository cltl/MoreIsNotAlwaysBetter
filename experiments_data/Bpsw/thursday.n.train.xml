State representatives decided <head>Thursday</head> against taking_a_poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State_Affairs_Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . Rep._Wesley_Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West_Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman_Bill_Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 .</context>

      <context> The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice . All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep._Bill_Jones , who was absent . Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas ' big cities <head>Thursday</head> . Rep._James_Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water_development bill passed by the Texas House_of_Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort_Worth to cover_up places like Paradise , a Wise_County hamlet of 250 people . When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas . Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen._Parkhouse .</context>

      <context> Committee approval of Gov._Price_Daniel 's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain <head>Thursday</head> despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered_down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House_Committee_on_Revenue_and_Taxation . Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . But questions with which committee_members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of_it .</context>

Rep._Henry_C._Grover , who teaches history in the Houston public_schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester_hours the so-called `` teaching_methods '' courses required to obtain a junior or senior_high_school teaching_certificate . A normal year 's work in college is 30 semester_hours . Grover also would require junior senior_high teachers to have at_least 24 semester_hours credit in the subject they are teaching .</context>

      <context> His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott_Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor_B._Jones of Houston , J._B._Brady of Harlingen and Howard_Cox of Austin . Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . Senators unanimously approved <head>Thursday</head> the bill of Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day_schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . It would authorize the Texas_Education_Agency to establish county-wide day_schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of_age to attend the day_schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas_School_for_the_Deaf here .</context>

      <context> It is not news that Nathan_Milstein is a wizard of the violin . Certainly not in Orchestra_hall where he has played countless recitals , and where <head>Thursday</head> night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago_Symphony_orchestra , playing the Brahms_Concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed . There was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white_heat . Not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent . Those would be reserved for the orchestra 's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself .</context>

They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old Garnett_Lee ranch .

He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at_a_time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a_little and his breath came hard through his nicotine choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate_Gallery on a <head>Thursday</head> once . Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure_enough he pointed at her with his index_finger and said `` Toot '' ! once_more and roared_off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .
