      <context> Still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing . An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true . A century ago , Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English_Protestantism , and that even high_Anglicanism would someday no_longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own '' . That <head>day</head> is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' . One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite .

This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like New_York , Chicago , and Philadelphia . What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self_enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non Jewish world .

      <context> The constant temperature contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm by Coates ( 1959 a ) , and apparently the emission at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features . Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave_lengths in_order_that the radio_emission of the moon can be properly interpreted . The observations of Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described . Measurements at 3.15 cm were obtained on 11 <head>days</head> spread over the interval May 3 to June 19 , 1956 , using the 50 - foot reflector at the U.S._Naval_Research_Laboratory in Washington . The half-intensity diameter of the antenna beam was about 9 ' , and the angle subtended by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes . The antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 b ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid_angle of the moon was known . The ratio of the measured antenna temperature_change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85 .</context>

In the discussion which follows , the time average of the radio_emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component . The 10.3 - cm observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20 , 1958 , using the 84 - foot reflector at the Maryland_Point_Observatory of the U.S._Naval_Research_Laboratory . The age of the moon was about 2 <head>days</head> .

      <context> In_spite of this , the very large radio_reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio_emission of most of the planets in a_few years . The study of the radio_emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25 - cm wave_length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 ) . This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25 - cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) . They deduced from their measurements that the radio_emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less_than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared_emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio_emission came about 3 - 1 2 <head>days</head> after Full_Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared_emission , which reaches its maximum at Full_Moon . Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing_out that rocklike materials which are likely to make_up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio_waves , although opaque to infrared_radiation . The infrared_emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due_to solar_radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase . Since the absorption of radio_waves in rocklike material varies with wave_length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material .</context>

Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid_gland . In the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia , hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity ( Money , Rall and Rawson , 1952 ; Stanbury , Brownell , Riggs , Perinetti , Itoiz , and Del_Castillo , 1954 ) . In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre is about 100 | mg per <head>day</head> . With lower levels , thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine .

Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome . I have found , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior . For_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got_up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following <head>day</head> , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the end of each session . Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met . This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard_to the wishes of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy_chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair - in_short , behaving as if I owned her room .</context>

      <context> New , indeed , is Luther 's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at . Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in_theory or in_practice . Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; even houses changed once a decade ; six hours of manual_labor a <head>day</head> for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; no private_property , no money ; no sort of pricing at_all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term .

      <context> Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ_Church and Regius_Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance_English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . But to return to the main line of our inquiry . It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these <head>days</head> many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr . Utopia is still widely read because in_a_sense More stood on the margin of modernity . And if he did stand on the margins of modernity , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom . It was not even in writing Latin epigrams , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics , or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus 's philological study of the New_Testament .</context>

We find it in the later Stoic conception of man 's natural condition which included the community of all possessions . This conception was taken_up by the early Church_Fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle_Ages ; and More was far too well_read not to have come_across it in one or several of the forms thus given it . But although the idea of communism is very old even in More 's <head>day</head> and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it is not communism as_such that we are concerned with . We are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus : Platonic , Stoic , early Christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism ; we are concerned with Utopian communism - that_is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia , as More conceived it . Perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of communistic theory .</context>

At the close of Davis ' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously : Whereas , John_Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this <head>day</head> doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper : Therefore , Resolved that , while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects , yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor . Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas , occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent_on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call_for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice .</context>

      <context> In the midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . The high cost of land and a_few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume .

      <context> Ever since Bambi , and , more recently , Born_Free , there have been a_lot of books about animals , but few compare with Max_Fink 's wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable My_Friend_, the Quizzical_Salamander .

It is not an entirely happy book , as Mrs._Fink soon becomes jealous of Alicia and , in retaliation , refuses to continue to scrape the algae off her glass . Max , in a fit of despair , takes Alicia and runs_off for two marvelous weeks in Burbank ( Fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen <head>days</head> in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which Alicia tragically contracts Parkinson's_disease and dies .
