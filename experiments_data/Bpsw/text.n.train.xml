We are left helpless to cope_with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false . Even Mr._Miller himself seems uncertain on this score . In a long commentary which he has inserted in the published <head>text</head> of the first act of the play , he says at one point : `` However , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer 's many faced lieutenants .

Yesterday , I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U._S._News_+_World_Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its disadvantages .

In_fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment .</context>

      <context> If all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible . For_example , the inflected forms of a word can be represented , insofar as regular inflection allows , by a stem and a set of endings to be attached . ( Indeed , the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings . ) The full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the <head>text</head> form list . Similarly , if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary , the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form .

      <context> The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc. . A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such_as Russian . For English the reduction in size is less striking . This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each <head>text</head> word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary_entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word . The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file . Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis . We suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem .</context>
