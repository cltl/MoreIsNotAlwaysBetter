In any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions , particularly with_respect_to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature '' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required . In the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for_example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiments or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of <head>security</head> in a legitimized withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy_life regarded_as forbidden , or by half conscious ideas about the magical_power of words ?

      <context> Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National_Guard contained in the 1960 Department_of_Defense Appropriation_Act should likewise be dropped . I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . I again proposed a reduction in the Army National_Guard and Army_Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal_year 1961 . These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national <head>security</head> objectives . - About 30 % of the expenditures for the Department_of_Defense in 1961 are for military_personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel . These expenditures are estimated to be $ 12.1 billion , an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social_security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) .

A substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications_systems in the air defense_program , as_well as in all programs where speed and <head>security</head> of communications are essential . Also , the program for fleet modernization will be stepped_up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures .

      <context> In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them - and that with independence free_men do not have_to work to realize the benefits of modern life . For_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement . The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with <head>security</head> and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies .
