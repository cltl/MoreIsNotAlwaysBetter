Selamet and his colleagues have made extensive studies of whistle phenomena in ducts with side branches that are closed at one end .</context>

      <context> In the recent past , a number of researchers <head>have</head> attempted to explain the origin of the sound . One might consider this source an aerodynamic whistle since it is wind caused and one proposal is that the sand moves as an unstable fluidized sand/air mixture . There are several other theories , but the aerodynamic whistle possibility is not correct since it can occur by simple mechanical motion of the sand .</context>

In particular , the point at which the tongue body approximates the palate varies from near the uvula ( for low notes ) to near the alveolar ridge ( for high notes ) . Although varying the degree of pucker will change the pitch of a pucker whistle , expert pucker whistlers will generally only make small variations to the degree of pucker , due to its tendency to affect purity of tone .</context>
