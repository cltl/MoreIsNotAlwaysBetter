      <context> At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on_trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as_well_as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ?

The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government . Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final_Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living_space through violence , economic_strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . In_other_words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted_on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .</context>

      <context> But I think that something more than this is involved . How did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New_England as it did in other parts of the country ? Is n't it a_bit odd that the three states of Southern New_England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode_Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A_+_M_colleges ? Was it supposed , perchance , that A_+_M ( vocational_training , that_is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant_class which flooded that part of the New_England world in the post Civil_War period , the immigrants having been brought_in from Southern <head>Europe</head> , to work in the mills , to make_up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ? Is it not ironical that Roger_Williams 's state , Rhode_Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? The state universities of Maine , New_Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; they had less immigration to contend with . A Yale historian , writing a_few years ago in The Yale_Review , said : `` We in New_England have long_since segregated our children '' .</context>

      <context> It is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations . As a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of Sweden 's ancient glory . He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part . Being somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern <head>Europe</head> , for which he at_once developed a passion , so that he spent nearly all_of the following ten years abroad , at_first in Italy , then in Greece , Egypt , Asia_Minor , and Palestine . In one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth . Deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie_in that direction . He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` The_Happy_Artists '' .</context>

      <context> There is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement : Adam_Smith was wrong . Not_only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism . The rise of the giant corporations in Western <head>Europe</head> and the United_States dates_from the period 1880 - 1900 . Now , although the roots of the mystery_story in serious literature go_back as far as Balzac , Dickens , and Poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19_th century that the private_detective became an established figure in popular fiction . Sherlock_Holmes , the ancestor of all private_eyes , was born during the 1890 s . Thus the transformation of Adam_Smith 's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life .</context>

      <context> His father was a good friend of Rabbi_Szold , and Joe lived with the Szolds for_a_while . Both these youths , who greatly admired Henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring Friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine ; and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with Papa , whose mind - although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it - naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were . Besides , Miss_Henrietta - as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back - had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; so Cyrus_Adler became interested in her friend Racie_Friedenwald , and Joe_Jastrow - the only young_man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta , and signed himself Joe - fell_in_love with pretty sister Rachel . Henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe 's older and more serious brother , Morris , who was just_about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa , when he substituted for Rabbi_Jastrow at Rodeph_Shalom_Temple there during its Rabbi 's absence in <head>Europe</head> . Young Morris , who , while attending the University_of_Pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write Henrietta twenty page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of Sarah_Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` Sulamith '' on the Jewish reform_movement being promulgated by the Hebrew_Union_College in Cincinnati . Unlike his younger brother , Joe , he never presumed_to address her more familiarly than as `` My dear friend '' , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style . And when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and Papa did .</context>

      <context> On_the_one_hand , the major European_nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience . But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard_to most_of the rest of the world . Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere . Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin_America ( though limited in Latin_America by the special interest of the United_States as expressed in the Monroe_Doctrine , itself from the outset related_to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance_of_power '' system in <head>Europe</head> ) was necessary in_order to preserve both common economic_values and the European `` balance '' itself . A nation such_as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied_upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin_American countries ; out_of_the_question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa . This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19_th century scholars . More emphasis was put upon the fact that international_law was the law of `` civilized nations '' ; Kent and Story , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made_use_of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent .</context>

      <context> A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in <head>Europe</head> and America , broke this unity and this universality . It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action . To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy .</context>

It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will '' put_forward by the Germans , especially by Hegel , although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of Hobbes .

I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer .

In my letters I took_on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real_life . Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after_school class I was enrolled .
