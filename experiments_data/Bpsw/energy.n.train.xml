      <context> A group of researchers at the University_of_Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques . One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched . A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed . Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood_vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic <head>energy</head> . The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes about 16 | msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue . A sonar or radar type of pulse_generator and time-delay_measuring_system is required for body tissue evaluation . In_addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique .</context>

      <context> But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather_than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location . Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness . Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists_of minute waves of <head>energy</head> . We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound_waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite . So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states_of_matter , successive one_after_another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies . This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .</context>

      <context> This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' . There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed_out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar . If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar . The concept of the strain <head>energy</head> as a Gibbs function difference * * f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear . Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45 ` to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear . According_to Philippoff , the recoverable shear s is given by * * f where |c is the angle_of_extinction .

      <context> However , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship . In the United_States , most_of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces . The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor . This `` ejection '' momentum is linearly related to the particle <head>energy</head> . They quote about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater . There is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in_that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin . The threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of * * f in the U.S. work and * * f in the U.S.S.R. work .</context>

      <context> Historically , religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication , enforcement , sanction , and perpetuation of various other institutions . At_the_same_time that religion exercises a conserving influence , it also energizes and motivates both individuals and groups . Much of the important individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives . The great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon_lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force , mobilizing <head>energies</head> and inducing sacrifices ; for_example , the Crusades , mission efforts , just wars . Much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion . The insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating effects . Religion provides the most attractive rewards , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely abide_by its norms , but who engage in good works .</context>

      <context> The significant things in it , at the higher religious levels , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of self-preservation , self pacification , and self completion . The chief experience is the sensing of communion , and in the higher religions , of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power . Related_to this is the fact that most_of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered , dependable universe . Man has the experience of being helpfully allied_with what he cannot fully understand ; he is a coordinate part of all_of the mysterious <head>energy</head> and being and movement . The universe is a safe and permanent home . A number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal . Death is not permanent defeat and disappearance ; man has a second chance .</context>

      <context> There is also the possibility , among higher religions , of experiencing consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and expansiveness . The kind of religious experience that most moderns seek not_only provides , clarifies , and relates human yearnings , values , ideals , and purposes ; it also provides facilities and incitements for the development of personality , sociality , and creativeness . Under the religious impulse , whether theistic or humanistic , men have joy in living ; life leads somewhere . Religion at its best is out in_front , ever beckoning and leading_on , and , as Lippman put it , `` mobilizing all man 's scattered <head>energies</head> in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance '' . At_the_same_time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment , it also has great therapeutic value for him . It gives him aid , comfort , even solace , in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate . He is confronted with the recurrent crises , such_as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life - marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old_age , the certainty of death .</context>

      <context> Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state . The belief in immortality , where held , functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here_and_now . The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance . The feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as_well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving_vent to emotions and <head>energies</head> . In providing for these inner individual functions , religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace_of_mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution . In_addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society . The two have never been separable .</context>

      <context> The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools . According_to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit . The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released <head>energy</head> toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem . Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced . The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination . But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple .</context>

A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used_to often seclude herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door - as I would find on passing_by , between our sessions - for_all_the_world like two persons , a scolding mother and a defensive child . Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome .</context>
