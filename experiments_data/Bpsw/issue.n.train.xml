      <context> The Georgia_Legislature will wind_up its 1961 session Monday and head for home - where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly . Before adjournment Monday afternoon , the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban_areas to determine what adjustments should be made . Gov._Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment . Vandiver likely will mention the $ 100 million highway bond <head>issue</head> approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . Meanwhile , it was learned the State_Highway_Department is very near being ready to issue the first $ 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test_suit to test the validity of the act , and_then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway_Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural_Roads_Authority bonds for rural road construction work .</context>

      <context> That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' .

      <context> These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case . It might be contended , of_course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism . But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben_Gurion and set_forth in the indictment . In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have_to be tied to the <head>issue</head> by argument . One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages . Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell_into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism . Yes , he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of_course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; but he believed in the Jew as enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things .</context>

It called_for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives . The general board declared : `` Most_of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right . The general Protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral <head>issue</head> , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' . An action once universally condemned by all Christian_churches and forbidden by the civil_law is now not_only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant_denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty . This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country .

      <context> And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons . The name presumably derives from the French royal_house which never learned and never forgot ; since Bourbon whiskey , though of Kentucky origin , is at_least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South . The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North . The race_problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , <head>issues</head> which may fundamentally be even more divisive . It is these other differences between North and South - other , that_is , than those which concern discrimination or social_welfare - which I chiefly discuss herein .

      <context> In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old_South . Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no_longer any hope of sharing_in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother_country . And no_doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . Among Bourbons the racial <head>issue</head> may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors . All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did . Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties . But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South - to use the moderate words favored by Mr._Thomas_Griffith - finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North .</context>

      <context> In every war of the United_States since the Civil_War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country . So instead of being tests of the South 's loyalty , the Spanish_War , the two World_Wars , and the Korean_War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion . And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold_war against Communism . Had the situation been reversed , had , for_instance , England been the enemy in 1898 because of <head>issues</head> of concern chiefly to New_England , there is little doubt that large_numbers of Southerners would have happily put_on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain . It is extraordinary that a_people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have . The North should thank_its_stars that such has been the case ; but at_the_same_time it should not draw false inferences therefrom . The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .</context>

      <context> The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . The two ratings yield a correlation of + .04 , which is not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics . In_theory , compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer . The <head>issue</head> of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken_up later . In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress , and the children 's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years . In establishing criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself .

      <context> We should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels , but it has not been . This can only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are insufficiently general . If , as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems . One <head>issue</head> that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems . Since tone_systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel_systems , we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis .

Tone_systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal_systems .</context>
