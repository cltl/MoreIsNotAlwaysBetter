      <context> Extremophiles have been known to survive for a prolonged time in a vacuum , and can be highly resistant to radiation <head>,</head> which may even allow them to survive in space . Many types of microorganisms have intimate symbiotic relationships with other larger organisms ; some of which are mutually beneficial ( mutualism ) , while others can be damaging to the host organism ( parasitism ) . If microorganisms can cause disease in a host they are known as pathogens and then they are sometimes referred to as microbes .</context>

On 20 August 2014 , scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living 800 m ( 2,600 ft ; 0.50 mi ) below the ice of Antarctica . According to one researcher , " You can find microbes everywhere â€” they 're extremely adaptable to conditions , and survive wherever they are . "</context>
