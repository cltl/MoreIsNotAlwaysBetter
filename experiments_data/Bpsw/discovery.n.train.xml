It was with the assistance of one of the members of_this expedition , Lauritz_Esmarch , that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric_discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric_current was made to flow .

An early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo_Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage .

The <head>discovery</head> that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a French magician , Georges_Melies , and an American employee of Edison , Edwin_S._Porter . Of the two , Porter is justly the better_known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first_step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion_picture the intricate , efficient time_machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands . Melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film . One of these is the `` dissolve '' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene .</context>

      <context> The `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to_be_sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo . In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film . Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time . This <head>discovery</head> of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician 's tricks produced on film . It was Porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued . The movie was The Great_Train_Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all_but incalculable . Overnight , for_one_thing , Porter 's film multiplied the standard running_time of movies by ten .</context>
