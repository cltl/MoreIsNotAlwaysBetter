      <context> In law , appearance ( from Latin apparere , to <head>appear</head> ) is the coming into court of either of the parties to a lawsuit , and/or the formal act by which a defendant submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court . The defendant in an action in the High Court of England enters his appearance to the writ of summons by delivering , either at the central office of the Supreme Court , or a district registry , a written memorandum either giving his solicitor 's name or stating that he defends in person . He must also give notice to the plaintiff of his appearance , which ought , according to the time limited by the writ , to be within eight days after service ; a defendant may , however , appear any time before judgment .</context>

      <context> A large picnic_area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in_width in_preference_to a long narrow area less_than one_hundred feet wide . This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions . However , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman 's trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit . The values of the site may be affected by the <head>appearance</head> of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there . For_instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might_not .

      <context> My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a Jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near Paris .

Beckett 's <head>appearance</head> is rough-hewn Irish . The features of his face are distinct , but not fine . They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel .

      <context> The wife , Amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` bird like brain '' . La^utner , for his part , `` belonged_to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in_order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so_far not fulfilled : `` They will be destroyed '' . The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as_well . His <head>appearance</head> as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other_than abasement and humiliation . At_the_same_time the multiple transvestitism involved - the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby - touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby 's , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life . The music which La^utner has composed for this episode is for_the_most_part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' . But it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice '' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art '' .</context>

      <context> We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism . Accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which I shall call mimesis in_order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) . The word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle . For Plato , `` imitation '' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical <head>appearance</head> , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence . All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . In Plato 's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers . Presupposed in Plato 's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom .</context>

      <context> After only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree '' , to_be_sure . There were more indications by the mid twentieth century .

In town after town my companion pointed_out the Negro school and the White school , and in every instance the former made a better <head>appearance</head> ( it was newer , for_one_thing ) . It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker_T._Washington had been going_on .

Their <head>appearance</head> , next spring , coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants . In the Sacramento valley in California , for_instance , it has been observed that there was not one day 's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins . This must be_due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal . After the male and female andrenas have mated , the cycle is repeated .</context>

      <context> Consider what follows from the positivist view . On that view , nothing good or bad happened in the case until I came_on the scene and made my remark . For what I express in my remark is something going_on in me at the time , and that of_course did not exist until I did come_on the scene . The pain of the rabbit was not itself bad ; nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured ; badness , in the only sense in which it is involved at_all , waited for its <head>appearance</head> till I came and looked and felt . Now that this is at_odds with our meaning may be shown as_follows . Let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come_on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered . Are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did ?</context>

      <context> The injured German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head . This resulted in damage to the occipital_lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . In_any_event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` psychically blind '' , while at_the_same_time , apparently , the sense_of_touch remained essentially intact . Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for_example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure_up a memory-picture of the visible <head>appearance</head> of a well-known friend in his absence . This circumstance in the patient 's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at_hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that_is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . The necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense_of_touch , as_such . We do not arrive_at spatial images by means of the sense_of_touch by itself .</context>

      <context> Then he might finally recognize it , apparently by combining the visual blot , actually being seen , with tactual feelings in_the_head or body accompanying the tracing movements . This would mean , it can readily be seen , that , again , for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have_to be repeated because of the absence of visual imagery . As one would surmise , the procedure , however , could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as_to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference . Men , trees , automobiles , houses , and_so_on - objects continually confronted in everyday life - had each its characteristic blot <head>appearance</head> and became easily recognizable , at the very beginning of tracing , by an inference as_to what each was . Dice , for_example , he inferred from black dots on a white surface . He evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects , but their size and the dots gave them away . And the authors give numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient 's part to show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself and how proficient he became at it .</context>
