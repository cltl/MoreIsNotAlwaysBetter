      <context> If we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing . Records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music . This difference is made_up of many factors . Some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of <head>environments</head> and social settings . ( Music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat . ) From the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original . Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests .</context>

      <context> It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges .

But no : Prokofieff grew . He accepted the <head>environment</head> of his destiny - took_root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise . By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people : `` I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at_the_same_time I have by_no_means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody . This is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose - the clarity must be new , not old '' . How right he was ; how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism .</context>

      <context> The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17.3 per_cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) . Publicity accounted_for 1.1 per_cent of the initial contacts with new members . In_general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account_for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood . The inner life of congregations will prosper so_long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; the outer life of congregations - the suitability of the <head>environment</head> to their survival - will be propitious so_long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership . Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation . In a rapidly changing society congregations will run_into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more_than a single generation . The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of_this struggle to maintain economic balance .</context>

      <context> The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; the schism between central_city and suburb , Negro and White , blue_collar and white_collar can be viewed_as symptomatic_of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis . It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved_with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social_class identity of middle-class residential groupings . The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations . This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable <head>environment</head> . More_than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples . Since American life is committed above_all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis . Consumer communities have suffered at_the_hands_of the productive interests .</context>

      <context> A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an <head>environment</head> in_order to strengthen an organization . ) In a mobile society , congregational health depends_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like elements will have_to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation . In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per_cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' .</context>

      <context> What additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ?

In the life_sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio - and physiological chemistry .

In_addition , our way of dealing directly with natural_phenomena has also changed .

      <context> The hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching_method was supported , in this case , at the .05 level . While we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured , we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the whole-word_method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives . Indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant . We speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules and achieve in_spite_of the lack of direction from the <head>environment</head> . It is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores ( although not significantly lower ) . Possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure . Our conjecture is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work .</context>

      <context> The interaction effect , which is significant at the .01 level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores . While high anxiety children achieve significantly less well ( * * f ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children , they appear to do at_least as well as the average in the structured classroom . The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools . According_to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school <head>environment</head> . The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit . The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem . Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced .</context>

      <context> It is no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient , the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients , shows , as one of his characteristic symptoms , laughter - laughter which now makes one feel scorned or hated , which now makes one feel_like weeping , or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man 's despair ; and which , more often than all these , conveys a welter of feelings which could in_no_way be conveyed by any number of words , words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another . To a much less full extent , the hebephrenic person 's belching or flatus has a comparable communicative function ; in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at_least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch , or the passage of flatus , not_only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze , but also because he learns that even these animal like sounds constitute forms of communication in which , from_time_to_time , quite different things are being said , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings and concepts , to say them in words . As I have been intimating , in the schizophrenic - and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic ; this is a question which I have no wish to take_up - condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well sorted_out , but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well differentiated from one another . Freeman , Cameron and McGhie , in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard_to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the <head>environment</head> , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation '' . In my experience , a great many_of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience . Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene . Recently , for_example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was .</context>
