      <context> He conjures herds of deer , and wild birds crowding the air . He suggests that Gore_Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor . The stained-glass_windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas , the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political_platform . The vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on <head>occasions</head> when one is faced with a_thousand unexpected guests for lunch . Larkin has an answer to all that . The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas , for_example , will provide needed space for the extra television_sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids . Also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented .</context>

      <context> As the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of Salem in Puritan America at the end of the eighteenth century . Aside_from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community . The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age . There is no <head>occasion</head> to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people . Instead , the audience can sit_back at_ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no_longer believes_in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion . A teenage girl , Abigail_Williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the Reverend_Samuel_Parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings . For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air .</context>

      <context> Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation . In these readings , the double_bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown 's attire - the musical equivalent of a bull_in_a_china_shop . Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances . The <head>occasion</head> for this marathon : Angel 's long awaited reissue in its `` Great_Recordings_of_the_Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro_Arte version . Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . Whether considered alone or in_relation_to other editions , COLH 40 is a document of prime importance . Artur_Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable .</context>

      <context> In the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and_then to paint . He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the Academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium . Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique . It has been my privilege to paint with Roy_Mason on numerous <head>occasions</head> , mostly in the vicinity of Batavia . More_often_than_not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting . What I have observed time_and_time_again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes_on recognizable form ; color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition ; and that over_all , amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark . Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done .</context>

      <context> O_'_Banion 's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell_Prison for three months for burglary ; two years later he served another three months for assault . Those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery . But by now O_'_Banion 's political pull was beginning to be effective . On the <head>occasion</head> of his 1922 indictment the $ 10000 bond was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle_prossed . On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come_upon by a Detective_Sergeant_John_J._Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the Postal_Telegraph_Building ; the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $ 30000 in bribes , it was estimated . As promptly as Torrio , O_'_Banion jumped into bootlegging . He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the Sicilians , but he had his huge North_Side portion to exploit and he made a great_deal of money .</context>

The preparations were elaborate : flowers , candles , incense sticks , rice wine , dozens of delicacies , and pieces of white cotton string . The strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls ( page 261 ) . The candles were lighted , and we sat on split bamboo mats among the village notables .</context>

      <context> Immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time . Physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at_a_time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers '' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing . Linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement . The `` projection '' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different <head>occasions</head> . So is the time of the novel . The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know . The time of the motion_picture is fixed absolutely .</context>

      <context> They for their part are convinced that Holmes is too `` unorthodox '' and `` theoretical '' to make a good detective . Why do the police find Holmes `` unorthodox '' ? On_the_face_of_it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine . Another , more interesting explanation , is hinted at by Watson when he observes on several <head>occasions</head> that Holmes would have made a magnificent criminal . The great detective modestly agrees . Watson 's insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes and his arch opponent , Dr._Moriarty . The two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness .</context>

      <context> Thus the cocktail_party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness . In_spite_of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group , the * * f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving_system beyond comprehension if N exceeds about six . The crowd consequently breaks_up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes . For the <head>occasion</head> on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a_few honored newcomers , then the `` open_house '' system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door . We consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land_sites necessary for family subsistence . We assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most_of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in Figure 2 . Information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second - , third - , and fourth hand as a distortable rumor .</context>

      <context> The codes are mechanism for training in , and directing and enforcing , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group . Durkheim noted long_ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things - unite [ s ] into one single moral community - all those who adhere to them '' . His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit . This is brought_out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public <head>occasions</head> in the United_States ; and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds . The unifying effect of religion is also brought_out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more_or_less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized . The Jews for 2500 years have been a prime example , though the adherents of any world or inter people religion are cases_in_point . it might be pointed_out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings - political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic .</context>

      <context> This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard_to the wishes of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy_chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair - in_short , behaving as if I owned her room . Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement . One finds , for_example , that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression , seeming at_first to be a mere hollow convention , reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings , and the most unconventional of meanings . More_than anything , it is the therapist 's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a spread-out deck_of_cards , on sporadic <head>occasions</head> over the passage of the patient 's and his months of work together . one cannot assume , of_course , that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later_on when the stereotype was uttered ; probably it is correct to think_of it as a matter of a well grooved , stereotyped mode of expression - and no , or but a_few , other communicational grooves , as_yet - being there , available for the patient 's use , as newly emerging emotions and ideas well_up in him over the course of months . But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at_work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another . Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype - a `` How are you now '' ? or an `` I want to go_home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning .</context>

      <context> Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome . I have found , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior . For_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got_up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the end of each session . Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these <head>occasions</head> when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met . This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard_to the wishes of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy_chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair - in_short , behaving as if I owned her room .
