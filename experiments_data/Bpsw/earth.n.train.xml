      <context> Nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God , and he still rules . Even death , therefore , has a providential as_well_as a punitive function . `` Wherefore also He [ God ] drove him [ man ] out of Paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because He envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because He pitied him , [ and did not desire ] that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable . But He set a bound to his [ state of ] sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take_place in the <head>earth</head> , so_that man , ceasing at_length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to God '' . This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus ' theology ; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ . As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life . It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is .</context>

From God 's Will and Wisdom , and from virgin earth . For ' God had not rained ' , says the Scripture , before man was made , ' and there was no man to till the <head>earth</head> ' . From this earth , then , while it was still virgin God took dust and fashioned the man , the beginning of humanity '' . Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private individuals , but as universal human_beings , who were and are all_of humanity . Adam and Eve were perfect , not in the sense that they possessed perfection , but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection .</context>

      <context> He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as_well_as of mortality . Therefore Irenaeus describes man 's creation as_follows : `` So_that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted_up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take_up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all . And He laid_down for him certain conditions : so_that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into <head>earth</head> , whence his frame had been taken '' . These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result . There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) . Man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil 's promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality .</context>

He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .

By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , Roy_Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art .

The solar electromagnetic - and corpuscular-radiation_pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a_few microns . Also , it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( Best , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected . A measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the <head>Earth</head> is obtained from analyses of deep sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions ( Pettersson , 1960 ) . Most meteoritic material , by the time it reaches the Earth's_surface , has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere . For all meteorites , the average nickel content is about 2.5 per_cent . This is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx .</context>

      <context> The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was * * f for particles of mass greater than * * f ( Dubin , 1960 ) ; this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of * * f . The data show daily and diurnal_variations . Ninety per_cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order_of_magnitude . One may conclude that most_of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the <head>Earth</head> 's orbit . There have been contradictory reports from 1958 Delta_2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable .

Mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves , the many threes-fulfilled on Mars , corporate and discorporate , the precious few on Earth - the unknown powers of three on <head>Earth</head> that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at_last long waiting he grokked and cherished himself . Mike remained in trance ; there was much to grok , loose_ends to puzzle_over and fit into his growing - all that he had seen and heard and been at the Archangel_Foster_Tabernacle ( not just cusp when he and Digby had come face_to_face alone ) - why Bishop_Senator_Boone made him warily uneasy , how Miss_Dawn_Ardent tasted like a water_brother when she was not , the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping_up_and_down and wailing - Jubal 's conversations coming and going - Jubal 's words troubled him most ; he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling , struggling to bridge between languages , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in . The word `` church '' which turned_up over_and_over_again among Jubal 's words gave him knotty difficulty ; there was no Martian concept to match it - unless one took `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` God '' and `` congregation '' and many other words and equated them to the totality of the only world he had known during growing waiting &amp; &amp; &amp; then forced the concept back into English in_that phrase which had been rejected ( by each differently ) by Jubal , by Mahmoud , by Digby .</context>

      <context> Neither nation would give_up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic_War . So , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own borders ) . Its citizens spoke all_of the world 's surviving tongues , plus a new one called Lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet_of_paper . Hal saw in his mind the rest of <head>Earth</head> : Iceland , Greenland , the Caribbean_Islands , and the eastern half of South_America . Here the peoples spoke the tongue of Iceland because that island had gotten_the_jump_on the Hawaiian Americans who were busy resettling North_America and the western half of South_America after the Apocalyptic_War .

      <context> I called the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves_Moreland , the Anglo-American literary critic - his mother was_born in Ohio - who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson_Downs , raising_hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old_man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such_as human stature , hope , and humor . My unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in_terms_of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from <head>earth</head> , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe_in the cult_of_personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . A bee 's place is in the hive '' . `` I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and_then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand .</context>

      <context> All this , though , is simply a prelude , a curtain-raiser , for what ensues , and I doubt whether any Occidental could accurately forecast it . If , however , it would help to intensify your anguish , I can delimit the powers of a_few of the divinities you 've affronted and describe the punishment they meted_out in one analogous instance . Hold_on tight . First_of_all , the six figures of the Buddha you heisted - four Siamese heads , a black obsidian statuette in the <head>earth</head> touching position , and a large brass figure of the Dying_Buddha on a teakwood base . Now , you probably share the widespread Western belief that the Lord_Buddha is the most compassionate of the gods , much more so than Jehovah and Allah and the rest . ' Fess up - do n't you ? Well , ordinarily he is , except ( as the Wheel_of_the_Law specifies ) toward impious folk who steal , disturb , or maltreat the Presence .</context>
