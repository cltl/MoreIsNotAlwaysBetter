      <context> Some members of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives . Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo_bumblebee '' as it is called in some European_countries . Female individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize . The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind_legs which in the case of the idler , Psithyrus , lack the pollen <head>baskets</head> - naturally ! The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host . When she succeeds , she usually manages to slip_in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment . The hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally .</context>

      <context> After_all , social life in the group of the bees is by_no_means general , although it certainly is a striking feature . On the basis of its life_history , we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees . The way in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect , either . It lacks pollen <head>baskets</head> and possesses only a large_number of long , branched hairs on its legs , on which the pollen grains will collect . Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks_like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind . Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali_bees . Nomia_melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United_States west of the Great_Plains , for_example , in Utah and central Washington .</context>
