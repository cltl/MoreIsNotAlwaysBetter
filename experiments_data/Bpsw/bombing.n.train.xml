      <context> The positive wave shoves outward from the point of detonation , followed <head>by</head> the trailing vacuum space " sucking back " towards the point of origin as the shock bubble collapses . The greatest defense against shock injuries is distance from the source of shock .

      <context> Apart from the damage to <head>vehicles</head> and people , a bomb exploding in a transport network often also damages , and is sometimes mainly intended to damage that network . This applies for railways , bridges , runways , and ports , and to a lesser extent , depending on circumstances , to roads . In the case of suicide bombing the bomb is often carried by the attacker on his or her body , or in a vehicle driven to the target .</context>

      <context> However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation_Of_Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities . I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the <head>bombing</head> of a little Korean town . I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in_detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen . And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious_mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .</context>

      <context> He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill . But Greg 's area remained as placid as a Florida dawn . Finally , as time began to run_out , he headed into Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that Intelligence had thought might contain Japanese supplies . The low clouds made <head>bombing</head> difficult . There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run . The accuracy was deplorable . One of Greg 's bombs hung_up , and he was miles from the target before he could get_rid_of it .</context>
