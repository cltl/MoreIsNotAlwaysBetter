      <context> <head>In</head> mainstream economics , the concept of a market is any structure that allows buyers and sellers to exchange any type of goods , services and information . The exchange of goods or services , with or without money , is a transaction .

Markets of varying types can spontaneously arise whenever a party has interest in a good or service that some other party can provide .</context>

Baumol defined a contestable market in his 1982 paper as a market where " entry is absolutely free and exit absolutely costless " , freedom of entry in Stigler sense : the incumbent has no cost discrimination against entrants . He states that a contestable market will never have an economic profit greater than zero when in equilibrium and the equilibrium will also be efficient .

      <context> The Government submitted its proposed decree on October 25 , 1957 . The plan called_for divestiture by du_Pont of its 63000000 shares of General_Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders , as a dividend , over a period of ten years . Christiana_Securities_Company and Delaware_Realty_+_Investment_Company , major stockholders in du_Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten year period , of du_Pont 's General_Motors stock allocable to them , as_well_as any General_Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright . If , in the trustee 's judgment , `` reasonable <head>market</head> conditions '' did not prevail during any given year , he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten year period . In_addition , the right_to_vote the General_Motors stock held by du_Pont was to be vested in du_Pont 's stockholders , other_than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware ; du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over General_Motors ; du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in_common with General_Motors , and vice_versa ; and General_Motors and du_Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided_for the purchase by General_Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du_Pont manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent_rights , or for a grant by General_Motors to du_Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General_Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial_enterprise by the two companies . On motion of the amici_curiae , the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner_of_Internal_Revenue as to the federal income_tax consequences of the Government 's plan . On May 9 , 1958 , the Commissioner announced his rulings .</context>

Within a_few years various du_Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General_Motors ' eight operating divisions . The Fisher_Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting_trust even though General_Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from du_Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General_Motors divisions .</context>

      <context> Du_Pont would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General_Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of du_Pont could serve as a director of General_Motors without court approval . Du_Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General_Motors stock except through General_Motors ' distributions of stock or subscription_rights to its stockholders . On June 6 , 1958 , General_Motors submitted its objections to the Government 's proposal . It argued , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both General_Motors and du_Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; that the tremendous volume of General_Motors stock hanging over the <head>market</head> for ten years would hamper the efforts of General_Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity . General_Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as_required by the mandate of_this Court . The decrees proposed by the amici_curiae were filed in August of 1958 . These plans , like du_Pont 's contained provisions for passing the vote on du_Pont 's General_Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their spouses , and other people living in their households , as_well_as other specified persons , were to be totally disenfranchised .</context>

      <context> However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant <head>market</head> which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' . 353_U._S._,_at_589 . Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision .</context>

      <context> It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government . It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority . Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society . To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative_officials and judges - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free <head>market</head> ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with . Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society .

Government itself was based upon contract ; business_organization - the corporation - was analyzed in contractual terms ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement .</context>

Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; even houses changed once a decade ; six hours of manual_labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; no private_property , no money ; no sort of pricing at_all for any goods or services , and therefore no <head>market</head> in the economic sense of the term . Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist .
