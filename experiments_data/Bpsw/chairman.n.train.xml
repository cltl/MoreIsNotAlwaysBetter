      <context> State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called_for yesterday in a report of a `` blue_ribbon '' citizens_committee on the aid to dependent children program . The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New_York_City welfare consulting_firm , listed 10 long_range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case_load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C._Virgil_Martin , president of Carson_Pirie_Scott_+_Co. , committee <head>chairman</head> . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend_upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' .</context>

      <context> When we arrive_at the events concerned in the vanished majority , they , of_course , cannot impress us as anything familiar . Nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja_vu , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists . If deja_vu is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental_disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people . Chauncey_Depew , one-time runner-up for the Republican Presidential nomination , was attending a convention at Saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel_Theodore_Roosevelt for Governor of New_York when he noticed that the temporary <head>chairman</head> was a man he had never met . After the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt . If Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja_vu . But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene .</context>
