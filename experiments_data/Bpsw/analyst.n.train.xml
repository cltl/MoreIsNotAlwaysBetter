      <context> Tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone . The possibilities are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater . Often , therefore , there are a number of rules having the same effect , and commonly other sets of rules as_well , having the opposite effect . Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning <head>analyst</head> than consonantal morphophonemics , even when the total number of rules is no greater . The difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology is an inverse_function of the size - smaller systems are more troublesome - for any given degree of morphophonemic complexity .
