      <context> This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more_or_less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek_by_jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928_-_29 '' . However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever . O_'_Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican <head>deal</head> . On Election_Day - November 4 - he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes . The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates . This further demonstration of O_'_Banion 's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone .</context>

      <context> It did seem impossible . The bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in_arrears , and the real_estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming_in , and that none would be sold to colored folk . When it was proposed to rebuild the church , Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high . He was sure that he could do better if he went_to Atlanta to get the <head>deal</head> financed . But when this proposal was made to his Deacon_Board , he met unanimous opposition . The church certainly would not be removed . The very proposition was sacrilege .</context>

      <context> `` And you know , Angelo , Pretty , he always keeps it a strict cash_basis , like they say '' - `` Sure '' , said Angie . `` Sure , Mr._Skyros .

Never mind how much I cut it , how much I get '' , and he smiled his sleepy smile again .</context>

      <context> The expedient thing - yes , very true , one must make_do as one could , in some situations . It could all be straightened_out later . Not very_much later , but when things had settled_down a_little . After this <head>deal</head> with the Bouvardier woman went_through . An ace_of_spades . He was not a superstitious man , but he felt perhaps there was a little something in_that , indeed . He rather wished he had never got_into the business , and still - scarcely to be resisted , a nice little profit with not much work involved , easy_money .</context>

      <context> Mr._Skyros was not a man who thought very_much about moral_principles ; he found money much more interesting ; but all_the_same he thought now , uneasily , of the way in which Angelo earned his living - and paid for his own stuff - and eyed the soft smile , and the spaniel like dark eyes , and he felt a_little ill . `` Look , my friend '' , he said , `` in my life I learn , how is it the proverb says , better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure . I stay in business so long because I 'm careful . Two_weeks , a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this_and_that , then we make a little <head>deal</head> , is n't it '' ? `` That 's a long while '' , said Angie . `` I tell you , you want to leave it that way , I do n't fool_around with it .

      <context> The trouble was that he had virtually had_to protest . The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him .
