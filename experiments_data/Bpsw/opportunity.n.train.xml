      <context> Not altogether a successful play , `` Epitaph_for_George_Dillon '' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling . It is awfully talky , for_instance , and not all_of the talk is terribly impressive . But it strikes sparks on_occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten . There is a fine second act , as an example , one in which Samuel_Groom , as Dillon , has an <head>opportunity</head> to blaze_away in one impassioned passage after another . This is an exciting young actor to watch . Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura_Stuart , whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch .

      <context> In recent years many counties and the U._S._Forest_Service have taken aerial photos which show features in_detail and are very good for planning use . Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor 's office showing ownerships of land . Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation . This gives you a better <head>opportunity</head> to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons . It is usually helpful to make a sketch_map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site . These are a great aid for planning use back at the office . For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry_through the study .</context>

Of_course , it must_not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him ; time and economic security ; symphony_orchestras , opera and ballet_companies ; choruses , chamber_music ensembles ; soloists ; recordings ; broadcastings ; television ; large and eager audiences .

Thus in Prokofieff the Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century . That his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it . That he mastered every aspect of his medium according_to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture ; and perhaps of even greater significance - his music is strong 20_th Century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution , based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music .</context>

      <context> When these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior_design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth .

Fortunately , although only a_few years ago they held the student at_arms_length , today the business houses welcome the <head>opportunity</head> to aid the student , not_only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior_designer of tomorrow - that the student already is `` in the trade '' . Even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern_slides . Here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced . The professional organizations such_as American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers , National_Society_of_Interior_Designers , Home_Fashions_League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work .</context>

      <context> In_other_words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted_on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder . This , in_fact , it turned_out to be . Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed_forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of_it , conscious accomplices of Hitler 's crimes ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually . What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this <head>opportunity</head> to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man_of_affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No_doubt many_of the citizens of the Third_Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today . The Final_Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others .</context>

Its people , including Pierre_Bottineau and other American_Fur_Company employees and the refugees from Fort_Garry , were joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort_Snelling when Major_Joseph_Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840 . The resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father_Galtier 's mission , St._Paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take_on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red_River .

Accordingly , though the practice violated the no trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's_Bay_Company , some settlers went into trade . The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought_in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain_from trading in furs . Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort_Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs .</context>

      <context> First_and_foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic_program for graduation . Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more_than half the student 's time in those years ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought_to begin earlier . Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the employment <head>opportunities</head> in the general locality .

      <context> Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state . The belief in immortality , where held , functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here_and_now . The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance . The feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as_well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by <head>opportunities</head> in religious acts for giving_vent to emotions and energies .

The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the interview records , categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity , then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records .
