      <context> This claim , as submitted to the District_Court and dismissed by it , 126_F._Supp .235 , alleged violation not_only of 7 of the Clayton_Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman_Act . The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any <head>line</head> of commerce . This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' .</context>

      <context> 353_U._S._,_at_589 . Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision . Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du_Pont and General_Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` <head>line</head> of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute . We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints . The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition '' .</context>

      <context> One growth center in a short_bone - distal phalanx of the second finger - was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short_bones , occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage . Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , dietary patterns , and health during adolescence . The following summary , based on Figures 5 and 6 , is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with_respect_to the appropriate mean age for each growth center . At the top of Figure 5 , for_example , the Onset range and Completion range <head>lines</head> for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according_to their mean and standard_deviation values in Table 1 . The 34 arrows , denoting onset age plus completion age deviations , have been arrayed in an Onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 34 girls . The growth center depicted here , in the distal phalanx of the second finger , is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short_bones . The mean onset age was 25.3 months ( Table 1 ) , and the average Span of the osseous stage was 133 months .</context>

      <context> It is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group . A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage . Boys 32 , 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 had `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion ; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys . Boy 34 , like girl 2 , did not have `` same schedule '' ; his arrow crosses the <head>line</head> denoting the mean .

      <context> What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search . These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces . To interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period . The historian can only point_out those <head>lines</head> which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding . Throughout the Dark_ages , it is clear , the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently . The pace could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood_on_firm_ground .

      <context> Whenever artists , indeed , turned_to actual representations or molded three-dimensional_figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . At_the_least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter <head>line</head> . Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go_too_far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . The storms of the past had died_away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not_yet begun to disturb men 's minds .</context>

      <context> The pottery of the first_half of the eighth century is commonly called Ripe_Geometric . The severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years , the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying Geometric pottery ; but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance . The vases which resulted had different shapes , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style . Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader <head>lines</head> . In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos . They had had_to work_on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses .

Though the spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not_yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the Cyclades , which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century . As the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident .</context>

      <context> That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all_too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of . Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself .

It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr .

As for this rider , I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted , so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes , I can n't say ; but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction . The last thing in_the_world that resembled a war was our <head>line</head> of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone_wall , and this dashing rider made us feel a good_deal sharper and more alert to the situation . We came_down off the wall as if he had toppled all_of us , and we crouched behind it . I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars , but that only proves that a_lot of people talk_about things of which they are deplorably ignorant . Whatever we felt about the redcoats , we respected them in_terms_of their trade , which was killing ; and I know that I , myself , was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun .</context>

      <context> Jacopo_Galli introduced him into several Roman homes .

He was able to discern the body <head>lines</head> of the Roman women under their robes . He spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together : a Mary who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; and a Jesus who , though lean , was strong even in death - a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead_room of Santo_Spirito . He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketches . Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional_figure in clay .</context>
