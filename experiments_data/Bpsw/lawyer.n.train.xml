      <context> Brian_Thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator . His salary had reached the ten_thousand mark . His expenses ran another four or five_thousand . The <head>lawyer</head> did n't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner_party - Thayer , like himself , Madden reflected , was the extra man so prized by hostesses - and found him easy enough to talk to . But he did n't play golf , did n't seem to belong_to any local clubs - his work took him away a_lot , of_course - which probably accounted_for his tendency to keep_to_himself . Garth 's glance began to flicker to his watch . He said that he had already told the police_chief that he did n't know what insurance man had recommended Johnston to Mrs._Meeker .</context>

      <context> He would offer no theory to account_for her murder . The whole_thing , his manner conveyed , was so far outside the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept_under_the_rug . No_doubt Mrs._Meeker had snubbed him many_a time and he felt no grief over her passing . Even_so , Madden 's dislike of the suave , correct <head>lawyer</head> deepened . It would be all_right with him , he decided , if his investigation of the fraud , with its probable by-product of murder , led to Garth 's door . Motive ? Ten-thousand-dollar bequest .</context>

      <context> Pauling looked doubtful . Madden explained that he was thinking_of an application sent directly to Mrs._Meeker . Then he asked to use the phone and called Brian_Thayer , who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o ' clock . Madden said that he would see him at two and made another call , this one to Mrs._Meeker 's <head>lawyers</head> . Mr._Hohlbein was out for the day , but Mr._Garth would be free at one-thirty . The secretary 's tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice was a concession for which Madden should be duly grateful . He inferred that Hohlbein and Garth were high-priced lawyers .</context>

He disliked Garth on sight , conservative clothes and haircut , smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties , handclasp too consciously quick and firm . Youngish man on_the_make , Madden labeled him , and was ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion , the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions ; that Mrs._Garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young <head>lawyer</head> ; that there were three children , two boys and a girl ; that she was active in the Woman 's Club and he in Lions , Rotary , and Jaycee ; and finally , that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their wedding_day . Madden knew that he could be completely wrong about all this , but also knew that he would go right on disliking Garth . Garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair , which would not , he said more than once , have ever come_about if Mrs._Meeker had only seen fit to consult Mr._Hohlbein or him about it . Madden regretted not being able to find_fault_with so true a statement .</context>
