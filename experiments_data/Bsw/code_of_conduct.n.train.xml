      <context> Driven from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguises himself as a private_detective . The birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal . Even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which give_rise to the mystery_story are not fully resolved . The individualism and public service of the private_detective both stem from his dedication to a personal <head>code_of_conduct</head> : he enforces the law without being told to do so . The private_eye is therefore a moral man ; but his morality rests upon that of his society . The basic premise of all mystery_stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal . Unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good .</context>
