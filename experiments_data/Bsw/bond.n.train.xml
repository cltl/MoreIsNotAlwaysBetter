      <context> A drawing of the structure is to be_found in reference 6 . The gross details of the structure appear reasonable . The structure appears to be unique among ROOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by **f . The <head>bond</head> angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal . However , the possible absence of a center of symmetry not_only moves the hydrogen_atom off **f , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent , with **f at **f and **f at **f ( space group **f ) , where **f represents the oxygens on one side of the **f layers and **f those on the other side . However , any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short **f interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non hydrogen_bonded **f interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 A .

Hence it is difficult to conceive_of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence . The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen_atoms to occupy general , rather_than special , positions along the [ 111 ] axis . If the **f <head>bond</head> is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen_atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen_atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheets ; ( 2 ) all hydrogen_atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ( 3 ) hydrogen_atoms are asymmetrically placed , either randomly or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen_atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms . Position ( 2 ) appears to us to be unlikely in_view_of the absence of a piezoelectric_effect and on general chemical structural grounds . A randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen_atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit_cell , for which no evidence exists . Therefore , the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen_atoms are located symmetrically ( 1 ) or asymmetrically ( 3 ) .</context>

The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions . Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon_tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data .

His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit . This is brought_out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United_States ; and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds . The unifying effect of religion is also brought_out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more_or_less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant <head>bond</head> , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized . The Jews for 2500 years have been a prime example , though the adherents of any world or inter people religion are cases_in_point . it might be pointed_out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings - political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic .
