Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e._g. , quarterly and annual dividend reports .

      <context> Hence the prime issue , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature . We are already committed to establishing man 's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social political economical context we are fond of today . Otherwise , we go_on endlessly trying to draw_the_line , color and other , as to which kind_of man we wish to see dominate . We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal <head>goal</head> in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else . We must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? So in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control over himself and over other men . Naturally this includes all communication forms , e._g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .</context>

Similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat_of_formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride .

A 6 - year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed .

A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more_than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region . Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present . The results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1000 to 10000 * * f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from * * f to * * f times normal density .</context>

Final ratings were made on the basis of a point_system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that was deviant from the discovered norms .

      <context> Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law . Indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific . In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliament - the elected representatives - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary . When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit - when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands - two purposes were served : Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law became a rational system for implementing that will , for serving conscious <head>goals</head> , for embodying the `` public policy '' . It is true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , inhibited the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy . Law was seen as an emanation of the `` sovereign will '' . However , the sovereign was not Hobbes ' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin .</context>

Research at Fayette_, Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg / l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb BOD / day / acre . Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the <head>goal</head> for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds .
