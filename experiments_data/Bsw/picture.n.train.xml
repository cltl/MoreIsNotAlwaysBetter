      <context> But this statement is completely unconvincing . If Bultmann 's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant . Nor is it necessary to look_for such evidence in the great urban_centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated . On_the_contrary , even in the heart of `` the Bible_belt '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological_revolutions have long been under_way , together with the corresponding changes in man 's <head>picture</head> of himself and his world . In_fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann 's argument is disclosed . Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence . This is especially in_evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle_class .</context>

      <context> And even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as_yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human_race ; so also did Mary , having a man betrothed [ to her ] , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human_race '' . Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no_doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' . His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary . That parallelism affects his <head>picture</head> of man 's disobedience too ; for as it was Christ , the Word_of_God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word_of_God in_the_beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe . With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality . At the nadir of that circuit is death . `` Along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience ; and disobedience to God entails death .</context>

      <context> This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus ' theology ; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ . As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life . It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is . This applies to his <head>picture</head> of Adam . It is borne_out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next . It becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality . This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek speaking ones .</context>

In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created .

By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , Roy_Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art . Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all . The artist was_born in Gilbert_Mills , New_York , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California , he lived in western New_York , in Batavia .</context>

      <context> Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on_the_wing - almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . It is this subject_matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors . Mason had_to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting . Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family_business which , though it was allied to art of a kind - the design and production of engraved seals - bore no relation to the painting of <head>pictures</head> . But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial_art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia . On the death of their father , they returned to their home in Batavia , New_York . After more years of concentrated effort , Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family_business at the old stand .</context>

In method as_well_as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism '' , anticipates a kind of musical_composition , as_well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as Leverku^hn says , `` there shall be nothing unthematic '' .

The monk Savonarola , brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn_of_the_century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art shop of M._Bluthenzweig ; in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according_to gossip , upon the painter 's mistress .

      <context> The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner 's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil_War .

Faulkner 's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life .

In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high_temperature research tools often more than 50 % of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode . The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical_phenomena occurring in free_burning arcs . In plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the <head>picture</head> somewhat . The heat transfer to the anode is_due to the following effects : 1 . Heat_of_condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic_energy of the electrons impinging_on the anode . This energy transfer depends_on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode sheath .</context>

      <context> Hydroxides , orthophosphates , borates , carbonates , and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hard surface cleaners . In_addition , the polyphosphates are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else . The importance of the inorganic constituents in hard surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers . Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date <head>picture</head> of the physical_chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces . The purpose of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories given below : Dirt , which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties . Greasy soils , which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats ( esters of glycerol with long chain organic acids ) .</context>

      <context> A number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather_than by the natural portal of entry . Some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle size than by the natural portal . Botulinal toxin , for_example , is several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os . In some instances a different clinical disease <head>picture</head> may result from this route of exposure , making diagnosis difficult . In tularemia produced by aerosol exposure , one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of `` rabbit_fever '' on a finger . An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious . Agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such_as those causing Q_fever , tularemia , brucellosis , glanders , coccidioidomycosis , etc. , belong in this category .</context>

The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth .

      <context> But the inner , formal_logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shaping their decision . When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesized '' - into larger planar shapes themselves simply in_order to maintain the integrity of the picture_plane . Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut_away too abruptly into depth ; and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump_out of plane . Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to_the_extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a <head>picture</head> starts ( if it does start from a subject ) . It was because of this chain-reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_objects , or at_least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there . Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities .</context>

When he heard Calenda say : `` What about that picture you took this afternoon '' ? it still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for Frank_Ackerly . `` What picture '' ? he demanded . `` You took a <head>picture</head> of me at the corner of Washington and Blake about three_thirty this afternoon '' . `` Who says so '' ? `` One of my boys '' . Casey believed that much .</context>

      <context> We all painted in our spare_time , and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships , but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it . Not much ; he sold perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to Joyce_Monmouth or her friends . He had style , a real inner vision of his very own . It was strange stuff - it reminded me of the <head>pictures</head> of a child , but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults . There was the freshness of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of self-consciousness , but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye . We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted . It may have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it did n't prevent the paintings from being exciting .</context>

      <context> We shared the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap lodgings of one kind or another . Attending the life_class was my idea - or rather , Askington 's idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two would n't have gone if I had n't talked them into it . I wanted to paint again . I had n't done a serious <head>picture</head> in almost a year . It was n't just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse I often used , even to myself . It was the kind of work I was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting . I kept saying , `` If I could just build_up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get_to be well_known as an illustrator - like Peter_Askington , for_instance - then I could take some time_off and paint '' .</context>

      <context> And it is thought by many who think_about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet , progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso , and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De_Kooning . Quasimodo defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' . `` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to Franz_Kline and myself , `` the nothing that_is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non time '' . It is his relentlessness and unwavering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such <head>pictures</head> as `` The_Invasion_of_Cuba '' . In this work , his use of non color is startling and skillful . The sweep of space , the delicate counterbalance of the white masses , the over-all completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece . I asked Quasimodo recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and_then had her breathe on the canvas '' , which was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity .</context>
