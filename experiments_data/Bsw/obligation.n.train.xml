      <context> Civic engagement can take many formsâ€”from individual volunteerism to organizational involvement to <head>electoral</head> participation . It can include efforts to directly address an issue , work with others in a community to solve a problem or interact with the institutions of representative democracy .

      <context> The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family_planning . Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed . Family_planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring . Pope_Pius_12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal <head>obligation</head> of parenthood for a long_time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such_as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications '' . This means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring . These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics in family_planning . The laws of many states permit birth_control only for medical reasons .</context>
