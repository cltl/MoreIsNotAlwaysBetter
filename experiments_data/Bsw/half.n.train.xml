We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at_least , Bultmann .

      <context> It is at_least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break_down barriers of inequality in the South . I should_like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect_to vocational education . First_and_foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic_program for graduation . Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more_than <head>half</head> the student 's time in those years ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought_to begin earlier . Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality . This last point is important because if high_school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational_program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .</context>

      <context> Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built_up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate . A system had_to be used which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time . A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure .

      <context> Wherever you looked , you saw Committeemen running across the meadows , some away from the road , some toward it , some parallel to it ; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at_least fifty militia were making their way in our direction . Cousin_Joshua and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington and take_up new positions ahead of the slow-moving British column , but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road . I did n't offer any advice , but I certainly did not want to go_back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out . Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the_British would be gone ; but Cousin_Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning , and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken <head>half</head> an hour for their column to pass , what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts . While this was being discussed , we saw the militia to the west of us fanning_out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road . It was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the Committeemen who had been in the Battle_of_the_North_Bridge , which entitled them to a sort of veteran status , and we felt that if they employed this tactic , it was likely enough the best one .

      <context> As Broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted_down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas , the American theatre is going_through an inexorable renaissance in_that nebulous area known_as `` off-Broadway '' . For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a <head>half</head> ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor . The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue_pie , gets a plate of English_muffins instead .</context>
