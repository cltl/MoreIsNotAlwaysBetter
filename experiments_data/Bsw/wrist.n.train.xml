      <context> In <head>this</head> context the pisiform is regarded as a sesamoid bone embedded in the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris . The ulnar column leaves a gap between the ulna and the triquetrum , and therefore , only the radial or scaphoid and central or capitate columns articulate with the radius . The wrist is more stable in flexion than in extension more because of the strength of various capsules and ligaments than the interlocking parts of the skeleton .</context>

      <context> In human anatomy , the wrist is variously defined as 1 ) the carpus or carpal bones , the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand ; ( <head>2</head> ) the wrist joint or radiocarpal joint , the joint between the radius and the carpus ; and ( 3 ) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the metacarpus or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones , thus referred to as wrist joints . This region also includes the carpal tunnel , the anatomical snuff box , the flexor retinaculum , and the extensor retinaculum . As a consequence of these various definitions , fractures to the carpal bones are referred to as carpal fractures , while fractures such as distal radius fracture are often considered fractures to the wrist .</context>
