      <context> Such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ; nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters . One of the early humorists already mentioned , Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials . Thorpe came to Louisiana from the East as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty . But Thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier_settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new <head>regions</head> .

The young William_Faulkner in New_Orleans in the 1920 's impressed the novelist Hamilton_Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so . Besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native <head>region</head> even for short periods , and in_addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years .

His own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the South , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation . His denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no_doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the South or have written_about the South .</context>

      <context> However , this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung .

Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , ' 13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , ' 58 ) .

The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood . Onsets , Completions , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile . It may be assumed that differences in ratings due_to selection of growth centers from specific <head>regions</head> of the body will be small , according_to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body . Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence . It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as_well_as Hand , it seems to be the method_of_choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood .</context>

The reason for the failure of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known . In our work the best procedure for removing substances causing nonspecific staining in_order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second milliliter fractions with sweet_clover tissue powder . The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a_few thick walled cells in the xylem <head>region</head> , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors .

      <context> Similarly , higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase . This is not extended to anticipated levels of GNP , however - only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against wage price increases . Finally , since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call_for less_than proportionately larger price increases ( e._g. , if a wage increase of 5 % allows a price increase of 7 % , a wage increase of 10 % allows a price increase of something less_than 14 % ) . We assume that average total unit_cost in the relevant <head>region</head> of operation is constant with_respect_to quantity produced ( the average_cost curve is horizontal , and therefore is identical with the marginal_cost curve ) , and is the same for every firm ( and therefore for the industry ) . The level of this average_cost is determined by factor prices , technology , and_so_forth . As we have noted , however , we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate . The level of average_cost ( equal to marginal_cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate .</context>

There are many grammatical misconstructions other_than dangling_modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations . At the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving .</context>
