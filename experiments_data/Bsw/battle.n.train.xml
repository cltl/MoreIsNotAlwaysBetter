The news of <head>battle</head> on Breed_'s_Hill had already seeped through , and New_York itself was now left in the hands of the local Provincial_Congress .

      <context> Putting the pieces of this mosaic together , Rector had the vague outlines of a biography . Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in Chiba , and divided his life between the land and the sea , supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing_boat . Without exception Hino 's brothers turned_to either one or both of their father 's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller . He had gone_into the Japanese navy , had been trained as an officer , had participated in one or two <head>battles</head> - he never went into detail regarding his military experience - and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out_of_the_blue , he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian . Rector was often curious ; often tempted to ask questions but he never did . If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so unasked . Rector had no doubt that Hino would come_back from the village bursting with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellished with his active imagnation .</context>

Otherwise , she would be baited into a tantrum - teased and provoked until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another <head>battle</head> in the maddening struggle of Tom_Lord Vs. Joyce_Lakewood . The car lurched along at a snail 's crawl , the left front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire , occasionally scraping against the road itself . Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering_wheel . He seemed very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was working_out exactly as he had planned .</context>

And it was clear that Adrien was not mistaken , for both Small and Cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant_mast till Philip_Spencer had given the signal to obey . Then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work . Alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin <head>battle</head> and bloodshed . Their strategy was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by Philip_Spencer 's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated . When the mast was raised , Alexander gave the order for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers . Spencer 's potential followers were openly sullen and morose , missing muster without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons , communicating with the three by glance and signal .</context>

We have heard that after seeing Mr._Quasimodo 's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . And it is thought by many who think_about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet , progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso , and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De_Kooning . Quasimodo defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' .</context>
