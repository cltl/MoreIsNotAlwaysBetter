      <context> The draft forward ( <head>bow</head> ) is measured in the perpendicular of the bow . The mean draft is obtained by calculating from the averaging of the stern and bow drafts , with correction for water level variation and value of the position of F with respect to the average perpendicular . === Variations of the draft ===</context>

      <context> For submarines , which can submerge <head>to</head> different depths at sea , a term called keel depth is used , specifying the current distance from the water surface to the bottom of the submarine 's keel . It is used in navigation to avoid underwater obstacles and hitting the ocean bottom , and as a standard point on the submarine for depth measurements . Submarines usually also have a specified draft used while operating on the surface , for navigating in harbors and at docks .</context>

      <context> The water draft of a large ship has <head>little</head> direct link with its stability , the latter depends solely on the respective positions of the metacenter of the hull and the center of gravity . It is also true however , that a " light " ship has quite high stability which can lead to implying too much rolling of the ship ( due to memory ) . A fully laden ship ( with a large draft ) can have a strong or on the contrary , a weak stability , depending upon the manner by which the ship is loaded ( height of the centre of gravity ) .</context>

      <context> Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in_relation_to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat . When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor - if I have been working on a full sheet in the field . `` When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal . When this linear <head>draft</head> is completed , I dust it down to a faint image . From this point , I paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage . However , first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described . Then I plan my attack : the parts I will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details - all_in_all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness .</context>

      <context> District_Attorney M._W._Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms - he just did n't catch anyone . Increasing threats on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New_Mexico . His friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense , perpetuating the troubles . By early summer , he wrote from Laramie that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in_a_bad_way financially , so Pels sent him a <head>draft</head> for $ 100 , warning that it was still not wise for him to return . Pels also sent a check for $ 100 to Russell 's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his grave . Cattle stealing and killing , again serious during the spring of 1891 , placed the land_grant company officers in a perplexing position .

So Lolotte - or anybody - could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied_with the missing bottle of opium . That was not reasonable either .
