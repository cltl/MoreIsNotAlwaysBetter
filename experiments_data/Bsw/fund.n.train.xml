      <context> The investment trust sector , in particular split capital investment trusts , <head>suffered</head> somewhat from around 2000 to 2003 after which creation of a compensation scheme resolved some problems . One of the common misconceptions of the key differences between an investment trust and a unit trust , is that an investment trust manager is legally allowed to borrow capital to purchase shares , whereas the manager of an open ended fund may not . This is factually incorrect , both UCITS and non UCITS open ended funds can legally use gearing in exactly the same way as an investment trust , albeit there must be a risk management process in place which sets out how the leverage is measured etc .</context>

      <context> The name is somewhat misleading , given that ( according to law ) an investment " <head>trust</head> " is not in fact a " trust " in the legal sense at all , but a separate legal person or a company . This matters for the fiduciary duties owed by the trustees and the equitable ownership of the fund 's assets .</context>

      <context> As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action . Pelham pointed_out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . A veteran Jackson_County legislator will ask the Georgia_House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . Rep._Mac_Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided_that such <head>funds</head> be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would_like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday .</context>

After a long , hot controversy , Miller_County has a new school_superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election I ever saw in_this county '' . The new school_superintendent is Harry_Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix_Bush , a school_principal and chairman of the Miller_County_Democratic_Executive_Committee . Davis received 1119 votes in Saturday 's election , and Bush got 402 .</context>

      <context> The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . Throughout the history of the program , state_government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures , while local districts all_together have spent more_than either Federal or state_governments . Today , Federal funds account_for only one-fifth of the nation 's expenditures for vocational education . The greatest impact of the matching <head>fund</head> principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds . National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades . During World_War 2 , about 7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) Vocational Education for National Defense , and ( 2 ) War Production Training . The total cost of the five year program was $ 297 million .</context>

      <context> But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at_hand . In what ways , then , did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself ? He could not see objects as unified , self-contained , and organized figures , as a person does with normal vision . The meaning of_this , as we shall see , is that he had no <head>fund</head> of visual memory-images of objects as objects ; and , therefore , he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again . Instead , he constantly became lost in parts and components of them , confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects , and_so_on , unless he allowed time to `` trace '' the object in_question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours . According_to his own testimony , he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots '' of color of a more_or_less indefinite size ; at their edges they slipped pretty_much out_of_focus altogether . But by the tracing procedure , he could , in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner , find the unseen form ; could piece , as_it_were , the jumbled mass together into an organized whole and_then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned_out to be .</context>

      <context> We should think_of it more as an act of justice than compassion '' . Because community not severalty of property is the law_of_nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his . Indeed , of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a custodian . He is a trustee for the common good , however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his misuse of that share of the common <head>fund</head> , wisely or unwisely , entrusted to his keeping . In_contrast_to this Stoic patristic view , Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely_on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve . The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions . In a properly ordered society the massive force of public_law performs the function which in natural_law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small_voice so often still .</context>
