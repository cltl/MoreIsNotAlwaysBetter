He hoped he was free_of self-deception . Here he was , suddenly caught_up in the delirium of a war , in the <head>spite</head> and calumny of Whigs and Tories . There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war . David_Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface . He knew that many were using it for their own ends .</context>
