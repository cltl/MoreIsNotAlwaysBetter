      <context> <head>Lead</head> is a bright silvery metal with a very slight shade of blue in a dry atmosphere . It tarnishes on contact with air , forming a complex mixture of compounds whose color and composition depend on conditions , sometimes with significant amounts of carbonates and hydroxycarbonates . Lead 's characteristic properties include high density , softness , ductility , malleability , poor electrical conductivity compared to other metals , high resistance to corrosion , and ability to react with organic chemicals .</context>

      <context> This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element . A high-speed shutter has been developed in_order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion . The shutter consists_of two parts : a fast opening part and a fast closing part . Using Edgerton 's method , the fast closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel <head>lead</head> wires . The fast opening of the shutter consists_of a piece of aluminum_foil ( approximately * * f ) placed directly in_front of the camera_lens so that no light may pass into the camera . The opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil . During the discharge the magnetic_forces set_up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center_line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera .</context>

      <context> Local school districts are hard_pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training . Programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business_leaders demand it . Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in_sight and requests it . State_governments have been taking the <head>lead</head> in establishing area vocational_schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities . Only the Federal_government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs . If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states . However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment .</context>

      <context> It was because of this chain-reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_objects , or at_least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there . Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities . Synthetic_Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this was the_point at which he finally took the <head>lead</head> in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it . But even before that , Picasso had glimpsed and entered , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him . It was as though , in_that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all_the_way back - or forward - to literal three-dimensionality . This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in_general ) literally into the literal space in_front of the picture_plane .</context>

      <context> Eight or ten years ago , a_couple_of French hoods stole a priceless Khmer head from the Musee_Guimet , in Paris , and a week later crawled into the Salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy . Hell 's own amount of chaulmoogra_oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the Blessed_One to forgive their desecration . Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I 'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for_the_moment , let 's resume our catalogue .
