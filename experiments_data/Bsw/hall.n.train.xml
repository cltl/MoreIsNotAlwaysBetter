      <context> === The Well of Loneliness === Hall 's best known work was The Well of Loneliness , the only one of her <head>eight</head> novels to have overt lesbian themes . Published in 1928 , The Well of Loneliness deals with the life of Stephen Gordon , a masculine lesbian who , like Hall herself , identifies as an invert .</context>

In ancient Roman architecture , where the term originates , a vestibule was a space between the interior of a building and the street .

      <context> This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not_only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue . A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained . The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental_to playing . Yet you feel the orchestra is near at_hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect <head>hall</head> . Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation . The music is always allowed the living_space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi performer . The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .</context>

      <context> Linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement . The `` projection '' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions . So is the time of the novel . The drama in the theater and the concert in the <head>hall</head> both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know .

Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent_movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second .</context>

      <context> Following Day was Woodbury who spoke of his disapproval of Brown 's attempt at servile insurrection , his admiration of Brown 's character , and his opposition to slavery . Woodbury 's remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times and once there was hissing . The fourth and last speaker was Thomas_Davis . By this time large_numbers of the audience had left the <head>hall</head> . Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city . He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments . In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took_part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned '' .</context>

He looked very carefully at every piece of furnishing , as though hoping to store this information carefully in his mind . He observed the Florentine vase in the <head>hall</head> , the Renoir painting in the library , as_well_as the long shelves of well-bound volumes ; the pattern of the Oriental rug , the delicate cut-glass chandelier .

      <context> He was moving like a ballet_dancer , playing for laughs . If Rose_Mallory 's killer acted this way , catching_up_with him was going_to be a cinch . We 'd know him by his stretch_pants and the flowers he 'd wear twined in his hair . Perhaps if Felix had first come_upon us when this boy was not cavorting so gaily up_and_down the <head>hall</head> outside the murdered woman 's apartment , we might have had less trouble convincing Felix of our seriousness . This , you will remember , was still New_Year's_Day . By the time Felix turned_up it was early afternoon , which , one would think , would be late enough so that by then , except for small children and a_few hardy souls who had not_yet sobered_up , it could have been expected that people would no_longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night 's noisemakers and paper hats . Felix was the exception .</context>

      <context> Felix was the exception . He had retained his hat and his horn , and , whatever fun might still be going , he was ready to join it . That , incidentally , might give you some idea of what Felix was like . After_all , he had n't happened_upon us in_that second floor <head>hall</head> without warning . The ME 's boys had finished their on-the-spot examination and the body had been removed for autopsy . The meat wagon , therefore , was not out in_front of the house any_more , but the cluster of squad_cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings . There was , furthermore , the crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance .</context>

      <context> Presumably the same sun was shining upon little Drew also , and those who had kidnapped him . But where ? It was still a very big world , despite all the modern cant to_the_contrary . Hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the <head>hall</head> door . He was dozing , perhaps the only sleep he 'd gotten . He snapped to alertness at Andy 's entrance . `` Sorry , Mr._Paxton .</context>

      <context> That left three , possibly four , one looking much like the next . He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule . He quickly closed it again . He had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments , but this one , from a glance at the <head>hall</head> furnishings , was obviously still a functioning town_house , and its owners were in residence ; that made it doubtful as the hiding_place of a man whose plans had to be made in_advance . He went_on to the next building and found what he expected - the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule . On one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes ; there were six apartments . Now what ?</context>

      <context> Muller , nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car 's headlights , threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table ; his face wore a look of outrage . A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain ; a following volley of shots shattered glass , ripped the ceiling , and sent him lurching heavily from the table . He was dead before his body made contact with the floor . Hoag stumbled back into the <head>hall</head> , leaned_against the wall , and started to retch . After Captain_Docherty sent Arleigh_Griffith for Hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before Griffith returned , buoyed_up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne .</context>

      <context> Before midnight he speeded his heart , resumed normal breathing , ran_down his check_list , uncurled and sat_up . He had been weary ; now he felt light and gay and clear-headed , ready for the many actions he saw spreading_out before him . He felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet . He stepped_out into the <head>hall</head> , was delighted to encounter a water_brother . `` Hi '' ! `` Oh .

      <context> Less assured than the tall , wide shouldered man in_the_lead , Cobb followed alertly , a hand on his gun butt . The bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it . He said no more . A <head>hall</head> opened in back of the bar , running toward an ell . Pat moved_into it . Small rooms , probably for cards , opened off on either side . All the doors were open at this hour except one , and it was toward this that Stevens made his way with Russ close at his shoulder .</context>
