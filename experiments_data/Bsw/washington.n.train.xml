The Bureau contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr._W._A._Wildhack , General_Chairman , and Dr._C._M._Herzfeld , Program_Chairman . Dr._A._V._Astin , NBS_Director , opened the 5 - day session with introductory remarks , following which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week by NBS scientists , from both the <head>Washington</head> and Boulder_Laboratories . In_addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards , spectroscopy , solid_state physics , interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress , the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics . The programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared , the application of infrared techniques to solid_state studies , and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation . Two data centers have been established for the collection , indexing , critical evaluation , and dissemination of bibliographies and critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision cross_sections .</context>

For years the United_States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro 's representative from secret military talks . But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job . There is a new atmosphere of urgency in <head>Washington</head> this week . You can see it , for_example , in the extensive efforts President_Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by_the_way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past . What the next move will be only time , of_course , will tell . Personally , I think we ought to set_up an immediate naval_blockade of Cuba .</context>

Blockade , in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe_Doctrine . It could halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro .

There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams . Manchester 's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev._J._D._Wickham , headmaster of Burr and Burton_Seminary , was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , Samuel_F._B._Morse . At_any_rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between Baltimore and <head>Washington</head> .

Goodwin was telegrapher for the `` American_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Troy_and_Canada_Junction_Telegraph_Company '' .
