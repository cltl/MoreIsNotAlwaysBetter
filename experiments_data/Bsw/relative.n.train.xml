      <context> The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' . Other recommendations made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any <head>relatives</head> , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity . Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy .</context>

      <context> Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro community . Occasionally they would write to the slaves . Early in the war it was not uncommon for planters ' sons to retain in camp Negro `` body_servants '' to perform the menial chores such_as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoes , and laundering clothes . Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier masters messages to their <head>relatives</head> and to members of their owners ' families . Unmarried soldiers carried_on correspondence with sweethearts at home . Owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19_th century America , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling . Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond , Petersburg , Washington , or Nashville .</context>

      <context> As a result , the proportion of males ( which leave the nest ) increases , and eventually the old colony will die_out completely . The nest itself , the structure that in some cases housed about 2000 individuals when the season was at its peak , is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain beetles and moths . Not always , though , does the development of a bumblebee colony take_place in the smooth fashion we have just described . Some members of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking <head>relatives</head> . Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo_bumblebee '' as it is called in some European_countries . Female individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize . The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind_legs which in the case of the idler , Psithyrus , lack the pollen baskets - naturally !</context>

      <context> Occasionally , you may come_across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning_over sods in your garden , but you have_to be a really keen observer to see them at_all . They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in_spite_of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . I must add at_once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their <head>relatives</head> ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold_weather . Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50 ` F and there is not too_much wind . Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a_couple_of those wonderful flowering currants such_as the red Ribes_sanguineum of our Pacific_Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy_willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins .</context>

      <context> This meant , concretely , that the patient could not read at_all without making writing like movements of the head or body , became easily confused by `` hasher_marks '' inserted between hand-written words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters , and could recognize a simple straight_line or a curved one only by tracing it . The patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at_all ; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him . After a conversation with another man , he was able to recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe at_all what the other man looked_like . Nor could he call_up memory-pictures of close friends or <head>relatives</head> . In_short , both his own declarations and his figural_blindness , when he looked at objects , seem to present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at_all . He was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed , precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape , already learned and held in visual memory , as persons of normal vision do . He could not recognize it ; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at_all .</context>
