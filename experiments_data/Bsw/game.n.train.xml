The opinion continues here that with a 162 - <head>game</head> schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10 - team league and a most inviting target in Los_Angeles ' Wrigley_Field_Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe_Ruth 's 60 homers of 1927 . Mays ' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year . Willie 's wonderful walloping Sunday - four home_runs - served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin_Dark . Next to Leo_Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass green rookie rushed up_to the Polo_Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant .</context>

Taking first things first , let 's understand the sport called gymnastics . It is made_up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run_through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work . The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms , but about 1930 it was in_favor_of <head>games</head> . The parallel_bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal_bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football .

The gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection .</context>

      <context> Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account_for group_actions , to provide a focal_point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification . One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United_States in more recent years . The popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American_War , the steady currency of the Lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass_media are cases_in_point . Nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national <head>game</head> in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of American life , that learned societies such_as the American_Folklore_Society and the American_Historical_Association were founded in the 1880's , or that courses in American literature , American civilization , American anything have swept our school and college curricula . Of_course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth century United_States . Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man_in_the_street . It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine .</context>

      <context> It was a cold and calculated look . He turned and went_back across the field to his dugout . He called_in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston . The <head>game</head> started again and in the eighth inning Mike_Deegan came up to bat . Everyone in the ball_park seemed to be standing and shouting . The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mike 's head . Deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him .</context>
