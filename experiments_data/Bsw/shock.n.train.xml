The minimum current a human can feel depends on the current type ( AC or DC ) as well as frequency for AC. A person can feel at least 1 mA ( rms ) of AC at 60 Hz , while at least 5 mA for DC. At around 10 milliamperes , AC current passing through the arm of a 68-kilogram ( 150 lb ) human can cause powerful muscle contractions ; the victim is unable to voluntarily control muscles and can not release an electrified object .

      <context> This <head>design</head> first appeared on Mors racing cars in 1902 . One advantage of this type is , by using special internal valving , the absorber may be made relatively soft to compression ( allowing a soft response to a bump ) and relatively stiff to extension , controlling " rebound " , which is the vehicle response to energy stored in the springs ; similarly , a series of valves controlled by springs can change the degree of stiffness according to the velocity of the impact or rebound . Specialized shock absorbers for racing purposes may allow the front end of a dragster to rise with minimal resistance under acceleration , then strongly resist letting it settle , thereby maintaining a desirable rearward weight distribution for enhanced traction .</context>
