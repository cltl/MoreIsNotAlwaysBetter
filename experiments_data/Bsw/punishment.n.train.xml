      <context> The study of penology therefore deals with the treatment of prisoners and the subsequent rehabilitation of convicted criminals . It also encompasses aspects of probation ( rehabilitation of offenders in the community ) as <head>well</head> as penitentiary science relating to the secure detention and retraining of offenders committed to secure institutions . Penology concerns many topics and theories , including those concerning prisons ( prison reform , prisoner abuse , prisoners ' rights , and recidivism ) , as well as theories of the purposes of punishment ( such as deterrence , rehabilitation , retribution , and utilitarianism ) .</context>

      <context> Similarly , certain hudud offenses under Sharia <head>hadith</head> tradition may incur fearful penalties . Penologists have consequently evolved occupational and psychological education programs for offenders detained in prison , and a range of community service and probation orders which entail guidance and aftercare of the offender within the community . The importance of inflicting some measure of punishment on those persons who breach the law is however maintained in order to maintain social order and to moderate public outrage which might provoke appeals for cruel vengeance .</context>

      <context> Operant conditioning refers to learning with either punishment <head>or</head> reinforcement . In psychology , punishment is the reduction of a behavior via application of an unpleasant stimulus ( " positive punishment " ) or removal of a pleasant stimulus ( " negative punishment " ) . Extra chores or spanking are examples of positive punishment , while removing an offending student 's recess or play privileges are examples of negative punishment .</context>

      <context> This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek speaking ones . They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history . Death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience . It represents a <head>punishment</head> that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time . These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified . The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated . Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and_then older and_then still older , in_short , whether Adam 's life was intended to be part of the process of time .</context>

      <context> Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and_then older and_then still older , in_short , whether Adam 's life was intended to be part of the process of time . If it was , then it must have been God 's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity . One night , so some of these theories run , Adam would have fallen_asleep , much_as he fell_asleep for the creation of Eve ; and thus he would have been carried_over into the life_eternal . The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a <head>punishment</head> , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural_order of time and change . On_the_other_hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence . It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law .

      <context> We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates . For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody . Professionally a lawyer , that_is_to_say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed_up , disguised - that_is , paradoxically , revealed - as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child . That this abandonment takes_place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring_down upon him the <head>punishment</head> for art ; that_is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann 's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even_though the constant elements of the artist nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and La^utner . It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann 's early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic . In a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one_and_the_same . Something of this can be learned from `` The_Way_to_the_Churchyard '' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure .</context>
