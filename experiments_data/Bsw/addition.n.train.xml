      <context> The only requirements on dictionary information made by the text lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms . This leaves the ordering of entries variable . ( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it . ) Two very useful ways for modifying a form dictionary are the <head>addition</head> to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more_than one dictionary form . The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage . The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents . Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at_once .</context>

      <context> The actual power requirements indicated 2 lb oxygen transfer / hr / hp . The polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per_cent , indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather_than through the surface . During this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted . Shortly after this study ended septic conditions resulted which required the <head>addition</head> of sodium_nitrate . The location of the oxidation pond in a high value residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer . The organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from 160 to 270 mg / l of BOD with an average of 230 mg / l . The BOD data are given in Table 4 , .</context>

      <context> The oxidation pond has a surface_area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 ft . The pond is currently serving 1230 persons or 260 persons per acre . In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors . It was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond by regular <head>additions</head> of sodium_nitrate until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green to green_algae . The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium_nitrate . At_the_same_time further expansion in the Red_Bridge_Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities . The large land_areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer .</context>

      <context> She told me . ZING was the creation of two men , Louis_Thor and Bill_Blake , partners in ZING ! , Inc. . They 'd peddled the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when - with the <head>addition</head> of `` SX-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising_campaign - sales had soared practically into orbit . Their product had been endorsed by Good_Housekeeping , the A._M._A. , and the Veterinary_Journal , among other repositories of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you did n't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friends would think you did n't bathe . My lovely caller - Joyce_Holland was her name - had previously done three filmed commercials for ZING , and this_evening , the fourth , a super production , had been filmed at the home of Louis_Thor . The water in Thor 's big swimming_pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds - fashioned , of_course , from ZING - Joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious `` bath '' while cameras rolled .</context>
