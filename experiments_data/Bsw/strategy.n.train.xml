Your competition is now proportionately greater - you are competing not_only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products .

      <context> We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry - at both the manufacturing and retail ends . Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts . The change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention - practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted . Have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing <head>strategy</head> to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under_way during the first decade .
