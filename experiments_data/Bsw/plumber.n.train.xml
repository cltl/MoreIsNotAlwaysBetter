      <context> Journeyman <head>pipefitters</head> deal with industrial/commercial/marine piping and heating/cooling systems . Typical industrial process pipe is under high pressure , which requires metals such as carbon steel , stainless steel , and many different alloy metals fused together through precise cutting , threading , grooving ( Victaulic ) , bending and welding . A plumber concentrates on lower pressure piping systems for sewage and potable water ( tap water ) , in the industrial , commercial , institutional , or residential atmosphere .</context>

      <context> The separate vocational or technical high_schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions . By_and_large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system . It is not often realized to_what_degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few . One has_to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high_schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` I want to be a <head>plumber</head> '' , and then , by doing good work , find a job . It is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get_into the most selective medical_school in the nation . Two stories will illustrate what I have_in_mind . One vocational instructor in a city vocational_school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city .</context>
