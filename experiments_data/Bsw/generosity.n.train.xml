      <context> In this research , by Paul J. Zak and colleagues <head>and</head> published in Public Library of Science ONE , the peptide oxytocin or placebo was given to about 100 men and then they made several decisions regarding money . One , the Dictator Game , was used to measure altruism by asking people to make a unilateral transfer of $ 10 they were given by the experimenters to a stranger in the lab ; oxytocin had no effect on altruism . Another task , the Ultimatum Game was used to measure generosity .</context>
