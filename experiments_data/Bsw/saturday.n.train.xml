A fourteen year old girl from the Middle_West observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities - at_least with the peripheral activities that many middle_class Jews now regard_as religious .

Another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only Orthodox girl in town '' .
