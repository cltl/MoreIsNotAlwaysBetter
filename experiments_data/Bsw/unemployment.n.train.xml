Note that the hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic is not directly blamed for the Nazi rise – the Inflation in the Weimar Republic occurred primarily in the period 1921–23 , which was contemporary with Hitler 's Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 , and is blamed for damaging the credibility of democratic institutions , but the Nazis did not assume government until 1933 , ten years after the hyperinflation but in the midst of high unemployment .
