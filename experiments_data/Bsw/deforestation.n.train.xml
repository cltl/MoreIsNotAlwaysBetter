      <context> <head>In</head> temperate mesic climates , natural regeneration of forest stands often will not occur in the absence of disturbance , whether natural or anthropogenic . Furthermore , biodiversity after regeneration harvest often mimics that found after natural disturbance , including biodiversity loss after naturally occurring rainforest destruction . Deforestation occurs for multiple reasons : trees are cut down to be used or sold as fuel ( sometimes in the form of charcoal ) or timber , while cleared land is used as pasture for livestock and plantation .</context>

Between 2000 and 2012 , 2.3 million square kilometres ( 890,000 square miles ) of forests around the earth were cut down . As a result of deforestation , only 6.2 million square kilometres ( 2.4 million square miles ) remain of the original 16 million square kilometres ( 6 million square miles ) of forest that formerly covered the earth .</context>

One study found that population increases due to high fertility rates were a primary driver of tropical deforestation in only 8 % of cases . Other causes of contemporary deforestation may include corruption of government institutions , the inequitable distribution of wealth and power , population growth and overpopulation , and urbanization .</context>

Modern examples of this were the use of Agent Orange by the British military in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency and the United States military in Vietnam during the Vietnam War . As of 2005 , net deforestation rates have ceased to increase in countries with a per capita GDP of at least US$ 4,600 .</context>

However , the incineration and burning of forest plants to clear land releases large amounts of CO2 , which contributes to global warming . Scientists also state that tropical deforestation releases 1.5 billion tons of carbon each year into the atmosphere .</context>

      <context> A study in Rondônia , <head>Brazil</head> , has shown that deforestation also removes the microbial community which is involved in the recycling of nutrients , the production of clean water and the removal of pollutants . It has been estimated that we are losing 137 plant , animal and insect species every single day due to rainforest deforestation , which equates to 50,000 species a year . Others state that tropical rainforest deforestation is contributing to the ongoing Holocene mass extinction .</context>
