      <context> Cyberspace includes : a ) physical infrastructures and telecommunications devices that allow for <head>the</head> connection of technological and communication system networks , understood in the broadest sense ( SCADA devices , smartphones/tablets , computers , servers , etc . ) ; b ) computer systems ( see point a ) and the related ( sometimes embedded ) software that guarantee the domain 's basic operational functioning and connectivity ; c ) networks between computer systems ; d ) networks of networks that connect computer systems ( the distinction between networks and networks of networks is mainly organizational ) ; e ) the access nodes of users and intermediaries routing nodes ; f ) constituent data ( or resident data ) . Often , in common parlance ( and sometimes in commercial language ) , networks of networks are called Internet ( with a lowercase i ) , while networks between computers are called intranet . Internet ( with a capital I , in journalistic language sometimes called the Net ) can be considered a part of the system a ) .</context>

Splitting by country , in 2012 Iceland , Norway , Sweden , the Netherlands , and Denmark had the highest Internet penetration by the number of users , with 93 % or more of the population with access . Several neologisms exist that refer to Internet users : Netizen ( as in as in " citizen of the net " ) refers to those actively involved in improving online communities , the Internet in general or surrounding political affairs and rights such as free speech , Internaut refers to operators or technically highly capable users of the Internet , digital citizen refers to a person using the Internet in order to engage in society , politics , and government participation .</context>

      <context> Scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon . During a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night . The luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca_miliaris by the turbulence of the sea . Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their <head>nets</head> during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs ; the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance . The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami_Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3000 feet . Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands . The tsunami warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander_C._K._Green of the Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey staff .</context>

      <context> Alexander_the_Great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at_once . As time has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military_vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range and breadth of message sending has increased . Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision_making , network structure seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network has value . On the parade_ground the <head>net</head> may be similar to that shown in Figure 3 . The monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence . No questions , statements , or explanations are permitted - only commands . Commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower_rank .</context>

      <context> A further regulation is that commands always go_down , unaccompanied by statements , and statements always go_up , unaccompanied by commands . Questions and , particularly , exclamations are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor . It will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the networks in_vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice . Furthermore , the network in Figure 3 is only the basic <head>net</head> through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the_like are interlaced . Not discussed here are some military problems of modern_times such_as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision_making are not the bottlenecks . Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain_forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach . This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for_example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry .</context>

      <context> This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for_example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry . We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes . This problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis . Since the difficulty of drawing the <head>net</head> is great , we will merely discuss it . First , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist . But , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such . For_example , there are persons who are in physical_science , in the field of mineralogy , trained in crystallography , who use only X-rays , applying only the powder_technique of X-ray_diffraction , to clay minerals only , and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating_on the montmorillonites ; or persons in the social_sciences in the field of anthropology , studying the lung capacity of seven Andean Indians .</context>

      <context> Presumably a cocktail_party is expected to fulfill the host 's desire to get_together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors . The party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another . The information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air_waves , and is received by the ears . Since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the <head>net</head> . As shown in Figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points . This , and other qualifications , make the cocktail_party the most complete and most chaotic communication_system ever dreamed_up . All four types of message listed in Table 1 are permitted , although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum , while exclamations having complimentary intonations are more_than customarily encouraged .</context>

      <context> Hino talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject . Putting the pieces of this mosaic together , Rector had the vague outlines of a biography . Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in Chiba , and divided his life between the land and the sea , supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing_boat . Without exception Hino 's brothers turned_to either one or both of their father 's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired <head>nets</head> and proved immensely popular as a storyteller . He had gone_into the Japanese navy , had been trained as an officer , had participated in one or two battles - he never went into detail regarding his military experience - and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out_of_the_blue , he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian . Rector was often curious ; often tempted to ask questions but he never did . If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so unasked .</context>
