      <context> `` That 's Johnny '' , sighed the bank president , `` the best hearted boy in the world , but absent-minded '' . But Mercer 's explanation was simple : `` I made_out the check and carried it around a_few days unsigned - in_case I lost it '' . When he remembered that he might have not signed the check , Mercer made_out another for the same amount , instructing the bank to destroy the other - especially if he had happened_to have absent-mindedly signed both of them . When the family <head>business</head> failed , Mercer left school and on his mother 's urging - for she hoped that he would become an actor - he joined a local little theater group . When the troupe traveled_to New_York to participate in a one act play competition - and won - Mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in New_York . He had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah .

      <context> Here we may observe that at_least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian 's research . Let us quote once_more from R._G._Collingwood : `` History is properly concerned with the actions of human_beings . Regarded from the outside , an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world ; regarded from the inside , it is the carrying_into_action of a certain thought . The historian 's <head>business</head> is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them . It is a characteristic of thoughts that , in re-thinking them we come , ipso_facto , to understand why they were thought '' . Such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition . `` History has this in_common with every other science : that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in_the_first_place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based .</context>

      <context> With_respect_to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their illusions , we can afford to wait , for in_time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see . Our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments . We should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities , state and provincial governments , rural communities , and other smaller groups , making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected . Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships of technical progress in various fields , showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education , how health affects labor productivity , how small <head>business</head> can benefit the rural farm community , and , above_all , how progress in each field relates to national progress . Efforts such_as the Community_Development_Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development .

      <context> It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government . It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority . Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society . To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative_officials and judges - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that <head>business</head> be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with . Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society . Indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society . Government itself was based upon contract ; business_organization - the corporation - was analyzed in contractual terms ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement .</context>

      <context> There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams . Manchester 's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev._J._D._Wickham , headmaster of Burr and Burton_Seminary , was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , Samuel_F._B._Morse . At_any_rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington . In 1846 Matthew_B._Goodwin , jeweler and watchmaker , became the town 's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his <head>business</head> `` two doors north of the Equinox_House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont '' . Goodwin was telegrapher for the `` American_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Troy_and_Canada_Junction_Telegraph_Company '' .

By 1871 L._C._Orvis , manager of the `` Western_Union_Telegraph_Company '' , expressed willingness to send emergency telegrams on Sundays from his Village drugstore .

In the fall of 1878 , the `` Popular_Telegraph_Line '' was established between Manchester and Factory_Point by the owners , Paul_W._Orvis , Henry_Gray , J._N._Hard , and Clark_J._Wait .

In 1879 the same Clark_Wait , with H._H._Holley of South_Dorset , formed the `` American_Telegraph_Line '' , extending from Manchester_Depot via Factory_Point and South_Dorset to Dorset .</context>

It had come as no great surprise to Matson that the hot water in the showers did n't work , that Loren_Severe had thrown_up all_over the stairs , or that some thieving bastard of a cop had walked_off with his cigarettes . It was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in Killpath 's office . Now , as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the <head>business</head> office , he nodded and said good_night to the station_keeper and his clerks , not stopping to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing_out . Not that he gave a damn what the grapevine sent_out about Killpath 's little speech on the comportment of platoon commanders . He just did n't want to talk_about it . If the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night , Killpath would just have to go_out and drag Gun back by the heels once an hour ; because he 'd be damned if he was going_to be a mid-watch pencil-pusher just to please his ulcerated pro-tem captain .</context>

Mr._Phillips took a razor to Gonzalez , Prop. , but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele would be welcome . Language was no problem anyway ; Mr._Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of Mission_Street . Aside from the fact that <head>business</head> was slow this time_of_year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising , Mr._Phillips had no worries at_all , and he said as much to Gun_Matson , who sat across from him in civilian clothes , on a Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed , mauve velour , $ 79.89 nothing down special ! `` She 's honest_as_the_day '' , Mr._Phillips said , and added , `` Mr._Gunnar , I can say this to you : Beebe is a_little too honest . You can n't tell a customer how much it 's going_to cost him to refinance his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down ! A time_plan is a mere convenience , you understand , and when '' - He interrupted himself , smiling .</context>

      <context> Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son_of_a_bitch '' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer_bottle into Johnson 's quivering ribs .

The car was just about to us , its driver 's fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on <head>business</head> , on a family in Sante_Fe - on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human_beings desperately needed rescue .
