      <context> And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious_mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence . The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ? Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral <head>movie</head> ? Every dream , and this is true of a mental_image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic_phenomenon for which no explanation is available .

      <context> From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth century American folklore . On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought_out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make_up this nation . On the other we have the flag_wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , <head>movie</head> producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways . After_all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates . In_addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever expanding and changing society . The problems confuse even the experts .</context>

      <context> The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not_only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; these films and these sequences are also seeking_out - instinctively or by_design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative . There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . The man was D.W._Griffith . When he came to the <head>movies</head> - more_or_less by accident - they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes . In about seven years Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film_maker .

Of the two , Porter is justly the better_known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first_step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion_picture the intricate , efficient time_machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands . Melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film . One of these is the `` dissolve '' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene .</context>

      <context> For a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger . In a series of fairy_tales and fantasies , Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complications , resolutions , climaxes , and conclusions . Immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time . Physically , a <head>movie</head> is possible because a series of images is projected one at_a_time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers '' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing . Linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement . The `` projection '' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions . So is the time of the novel .</context>

      <context> I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' . `` What is it '' ? asked the children , whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable . Maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of Arlene . `` Just you wait '' , advised Arlene , echoing the dialogue in a recent British <head>movie</head> . And when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time . First , Arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults . They had protested that that was n't any surprise .</context>

      <context> For_example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate . Likewise , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely synonyms as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue-twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen '' all originated_in the same village in Bathar-on-Walli_Province and are all used to express sentiments concerning British `` imperialism '' . The terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start spouting them to your date , it might be best to find_out if he was a member of Major_Pockmanster 's Delhi_Regiment , since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in_that outfit . The_Breeze_And_Chancellor_Neitzbohr , a <head>movie</head> melodrama that concerns the attempts of a West German politician to woo a plaster_cast of the Apollo_Belvedere . As you have doubtless guessed already , the plot is plastered with Freudian , Jungian , and Meinckian theory . For_example , when the film is only four minutes old , Neitzbohr refers to a small , Victorian piano_stool as `` Wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano_stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of_course , was Doris ( the English equivalent , when passed_through middle Gaelic derivations , of Wilhelmina ) . For the remainder of the movie , Chancellor_Neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano_stool with a slat from a Venetian_blind that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag .</context>

In this manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt_pangs caused by his personal assaults against the_English at Dunkirk . As we find_out at the end , it is not the stool ( symbolizing Doris , therefore the_English ) that he is punishing but the piece of Venetian_blind . And , when the slat finally shatters , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` He loves me , he loves me not '' .</context>
