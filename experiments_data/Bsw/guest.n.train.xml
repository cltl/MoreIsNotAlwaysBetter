The <head>guest</head> list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time . It included the top O_'_Banion men and Chief_of_Detectives_Michael_Hughes .

I remember standing in a corner , watching Jessica act the hostess , serving soft_drinks to her <head>guests</head> . She was wearing her dark hair in two , thick braids to attain an `` American_Girl '' effect she thought was appropriate to Halloween . It made her look sweet and schoolgirlish , I was excited to be with her , but I did not know how to express it . Yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter_writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages , out of my mind , and plant himself in reality .</context>

It was not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel .</context>

      <context> If Mahzeer was planning to set_up the prime_minister for Muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes . Hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building . Wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories . On the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party <head>guests</head> ; the scene looked_like a Christmas_card . On the third floor one of the two windows was lighted ; it was framed in maroon drapes , and no faces were visible . This would be Mahzeer 's office . He and the prime_minister would be back from the window , seated at Mahzeer 's desk ; they would be going_over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting .</context>
