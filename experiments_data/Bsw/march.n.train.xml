Marches can be written in any time signature , but the most common time signatures are 44 , 22 ( alla breve , although this may refer to 2 time of Johannes Brahms , or cut time ) , or 68 .</context>

      <context> The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or_else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery . The image of God has simply disappeared . All such imitations of negative quality have given_rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at_least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak_to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved . The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the <head>march</head> of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems . Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually_exclusive , that they belong together .

Alphonse_R_._Hoge 's measurements of several very young specimens from Brazil suggest that at_birth the female is slightly larger than the male . I have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity . Carl_Kauffeld has written to me of sexual_activity in February 1943 of young born in <head>March</head> 1940 . One female , collected on an island off the coast of Nicaragua , was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from snout to vent ( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long ) . The female from Central_America which gave_birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long . What data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; unfortunately , no_one has kept complete records of one individual , whereas many have been made for a very short period_of_time .</context>

      <context> Serial serum potassium levels remained normal ; the serum glutamic_oxaloacetic_transaminase was 10 units per ml. per min. . The clinical impression at this time was either muscular_dystrophy or polymyositis . On Feb. 12 , 1959 , purified corticotropin ( ACTH_Gel ) , 20 units daily intramuscularly , was started but had_to be discontinued 3 weeks later because of excessive fluid retention . From <head>March</head> 3 to May 1 , 1949 , the patient was maintained on dexamethasone , 3 to 6 mg. daily . In May 1959 , prednisone , 30 mg. daily , replaced the dexamethasone . Muscle weakness did not improve , and the patient needed first a cane , then crutches . In_spite of normal thyroid function tests , a trial of propylthiouracil , 400 mg. daily for one week , was given but served only to intensify muscle weakness .</context>

      <context> In proportion as meanings are concrete , we can better rely_on their being insulated and distinctive . An elephant or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious , common-sense , indubitable identity , as do an eye or tooth or nail . They isolate out easily , naturally , and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence ; and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities . With the universal list as his weapon , Swadesh has extended his <head>march</head> of conquest farther and farther into the past , eight , ten , twelve millennia back . And he has proclaimed greater or less affiliation between all Western_hemisphere languages . Some of_this may prove to be true , or even considerable of_it , whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence . But the farther out he moves , the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence , and the larger the speculative component in his inferences .</context>

      <context> Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers_Ferry before they abandoned it ; of their first engagement at Falling_Waters after Old_Jack 's First_Brigade had destroyed all the rolling_stock of the B_+_O_Railroad . The men were restive , he wrote , ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished . The peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in Wheeling , Which had formed a new state_government by declaring the government at Richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors . Dangling his gaudy trinkets before them , he told of the Rebel losses in the mountains , at Cheat and Rich mountains both , and the Federal <head>march</head> on Beverly . `` Cleaned all them Rebs out'n the hills , they did ! They won't never git over inter loyal western Virginia , them traitors ! The Federals is making everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too '' , he crowed .</context>
