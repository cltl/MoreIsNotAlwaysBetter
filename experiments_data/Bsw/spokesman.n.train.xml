      <context> This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the District_Court . This Court 's judgment was filed in the District_Court on July 18 , 1957 . The first pretrial conference - held to appoint amici_curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of du_Pont and General_Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings - took_place on September 25 , 1957 . At the outset , the Government 's <head>spokesman</head> explained that counsel for the Government and for du_Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court . Du_Pont , he said , had proposed disenfranchisement of its General_Motors stock along with other restrictions on the du_Pont-General_Motors relationship . The Government , deeming these suggestions inadequate , had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du_Pont 's shares of General_Motors . Counsel for the Government invited du_Pont 's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if counsel for du_Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable , the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days .</context>
