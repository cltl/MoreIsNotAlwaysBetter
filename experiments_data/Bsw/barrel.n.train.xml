      <context> He looked_out of the tent at the company street . The rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street . Beyond that misty gray of the rain , he saw the stretching hutment , low diminutive log_cabins , chinked with mud , with doorways a man would have_to crouch to get through , with roofs of tenting laid_over boughs or boards from hardtack boxes , or fence_rails , with cranky chimneys of sticks and dried mud . The chimney of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef <head>barrel</head> with ends knocked_out . In this heavy air , however , that device did not seem to help . The smoke from that chimney rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other , and hung as sadly in the drizzle , creeping back_down along the sopping canvas of the roof . Over the door was a board with large , inept lettering :</context>

      <context> The burning air dried his sweat soaked clothes in salt edged patches . He cleared his throat and wet his lips . As cheerfully as possible , he said , `` Well , I guess we could all do with a little drink '' . He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a <head>barrel</head> . They could no_longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat_bag that cooled it by evaporation . The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste . But it was water .</context>

      <context> Quite candidly , fellows , I would n't be_in_your_shoes for all the rice in China . As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly . Sometime on Saturday evening , August 22nd , while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria_dell_'Orso , in Rome , you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks_County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . Hastening to the attic , the temperature of_which was easily hotter than the Gold_Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the_like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and <head>barrels</head> stored there . What you were looking_for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis_rackets and fly screens ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph_records scattered about a fumed_oak Victrola , you danced two tangos and a paso_doble , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu . You then descended one story , glommed a television_set from the music room - the only constructive feature of your visit , by_the_way - and , returning to the ground_floor , entered the master_bedroom . From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade handled magnifying_glass .</context>
