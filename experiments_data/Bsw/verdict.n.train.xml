      <context> It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as_long_as there are Jews . As_such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message '' . `` It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial '' - said Ben_Gurion , `` and not the Nazi regime alone - but anti-Semitism throughout history '' . How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-Semite contribute to a <head>verdict</head> against anti-Semitism ? And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all_but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a `` fiend '' ? These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case . It might be contended , of_course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism .</context>
