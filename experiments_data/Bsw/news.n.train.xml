      <context> Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .

I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in_detail , from the hodge-podge of <head>news</head> pictures I have seen . And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious_mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .

Under this program , property sales specialists in the Small_Business_Administration regional offices help small business_concerns to locate Federal property for_sale and insure that small firms have the opportunity to bid competitively for surplus personal and real_property and certain natural_resources , including timber from the national forests .

Proposed property sales of general interest to small business_concerns are publicized through SBA regional <head>news</head> releases , and by `` flyers '' directed to the small business_concerns . Each SBA regional office also maintains a `` want '' list of surplus property , principally machinery and equipment , desired by small business_concerns in its area .

Heiser , breathless and wild-eyed , brought the chilling <head>news</head> that the handspikes , heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places . `` And also , sir , two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely . An African knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by McKinley and Green . McKinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into Spencer 's possession and that '' -</context>

      <context> She kissed him passionately upon his reappearance . He kissed her back . Not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese . In <head>news</head> items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs . `` While Henry_Morgan was escorting Miss_Vera_Green from the church social last Saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit Mr._Morgan on the public_square '' . Such items recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie_star : `` The area in which Miss_N - was injured is spectacularly scenic '' . The double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gags of Weber and Fields .</context>

      <context> The Dharma_Dictionary , a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with Eurasian proto-senility cults . It 's somewhat off_the_beaten_track , to_be_sure , but therein lies its variety and charm . For_example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate . Likewise , and equally fascinating , is the <head>news</head> that such unlikely synonyms as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue-twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen '' all originated_in the same village in Bathar-on-Walli_Province and are all used to express sentiments concerning British `` imperialism '' . The terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start spouting them to your date , it might be best to find_out if he was a member of Major_Pockmanster 's Delhi_Regiment , since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in_that outfit . The_Breeze_And_Chancellor_Neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concerns the attempts of a West German politician to woo a plaster_cast of the Apollo_Belvedere .
