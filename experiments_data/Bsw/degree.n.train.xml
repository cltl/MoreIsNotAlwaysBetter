Some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings .

Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests . Yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records .

Command 's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one .

The principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy '' is Alfred_North_Whitehead .

We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some <head>degree</head> wholesome or threatening . Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience . It takes a great_deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one 's world simply as a collection of sense_data arranged in such_and_such sequence and pattern , devoid_of all power to move the feelings and actions except in_so_far as they present themselves for inspection . Whitehead is here questioning David_Hume 's understanding of the nature of experience ; he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from Hume 's presupposition that experience is merely sense_data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived .</context>

      <context> The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated . Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies_in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity . A state of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not_only an increase in the parasympathetic reactivity this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli , but leads also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus acting sympathetically under control_conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response ! Furthermore , conditioned_reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level , and several types of behavioral changes probably related_to the <head>degree</head> of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observed . If , for_instance , such a change is produced by one or a_few insulin comas or electroshocks , previously inhibited conditioned_reactions reappear . However , if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished . In other studies , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned_reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatments , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes .</context>

In_view_of the important role which emotional_disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes .</context>

From even a cursory inspection of its many aspects , however , the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B.C. The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant <head>degree</head> . Much which was in_embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 . In this process the Minoan Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected ; the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800 . Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times - granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside - are correct ; but all_too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took_place in the early first millennium .</context>

The focus of novelty in this world now lay_in the south-eastern districts of the Greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean , always excepting its northern shores , had accepted the Geometric style of pottery . While Protogeometric vases usually turn_up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as_many or more examples of local stamp , these `` non Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century . In their place came local variations within the common style - tentative , as_it_were , in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed .</context>

      <context> O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes . They indicated that a 4 - day retention , aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 per_cent BOD reduction . Later , Eckenfelder increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per_cent in the summer months . It appeared from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as_well as providing the same <head>degree</head> of treatment in a smaller volume . With the development of the Red_Bridge_Subdivision south of Kansas_City , Missouri , the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate sewage_disposal . The sewage_system from Kansas_City was not expected to serve the Red_Bridge area for several years . This necessitated the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 yrs. .</context>
