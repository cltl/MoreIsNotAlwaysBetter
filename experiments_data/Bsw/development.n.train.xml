      <context> <head>In</head> classical music , musical development is a process by which a musical idea is communicated in the course of a composition . It refers to the transformation and restatement of initial material , and is often contrasted with musical variation , which is a slightly different means to the same end . Development is carried out upon portions of material treated in many different presentations and combinations at a time , while variation depends upon one type of presentation at a time .</context>

Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone . Rarer still is a Mr._America or Mr._Universe of true Herculean build . The aspects of physical <head>development</head> that catch the judges ' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion - superior definition of the muscles . Now good definition is one thing that all_of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light weight workouts . But contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor 's chisel - is something quite different . This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him .</context>

      <context> Only when the newest Mr._America or Mr._Universe rediscovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once_again see how effective they really are . The exercise I shall discuss in this - the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition specialization of a particular body_part - is the One_Leg_Lunge . Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no_matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ! It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline - that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders - a criterion of muscle `` drama '' that_is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike - the facet of muscular <head>development</head> that wins prizes . Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable . The One_Leg_Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts . But for purely definition purposes - used in conjunction with your regular Squatting , Leg_Curling , Leg_Extensor programs - a heavy weight is not needed .</context>

You 'll need your Weider_Power_Stands for this fine exercise and here 's the way it 's done : Place your Power_Stands in position and adjust their height so_that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean .

In his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked_out '' equipment since Vic_Tanny . Mr._Claude is a specialist in torso <head>development</head> and he has long favored the now famous Weider_Push-Pull_Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . So right_away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull_Super-Set consisting_of the wide grip Straight-Arm_Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull_Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib_cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar Bench_Press which specifically works_on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids . As you can see , in this Push-Pull_Super_Set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises , so the complete torso remains pumped-up all_the_time !

      <context> Since then , many Protestant_denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not_only approved birth_control , but declared it at_times to be a religious duty .

This <head>development</head> is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National_Council_of_Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the US .

      <context> Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore .

As_long_as his material is Americana , can in_some_way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied . From all this we can now see that two streams of <head>development</head> run through the history of twentieth century American folklore . On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought_out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make_up this nation . On the other we have the flag_wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways .</context>

In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large_numbers from the simple-minded , one minute shows .

      <context> Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation . In a rapidly changing society congregations will run_into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more_than a single generation . The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of_this struggle to maintain economic balance . The expense of_this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant <head>development</head> . It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends - expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings . These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis . Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions .</context>

      <context> The central_city areas , in_other_words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life_principle of congregations of the major denominations : they have too few middle-class people ; they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents . Central_city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central_cities . With few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central_city . The key to Protestant <head>development</head> , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation . Members of higher and lower social_status often cluster around this nucleus , so_that Protestant figures on social_class give the impression of spread over all social_classes ; but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum . The congregation perishes when it is no_longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have_to recruit constantly in their core stratum in_order to survive ; they can lose higher - and lower status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in_order to preserve economic integration .

      <context> The word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle . For Plato , `` imitation '' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence . All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . In Plato 's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full <head>development</head> of their intellectual powers . Presupposed in Plato 's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom . Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato .</context>

      <context> As capitalism in the 20_th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private_detective is placed in a serious dilemma . If he is good , he may not be legal ; if he is legal , he may not be good . It is the gradual unfolding and deepening of_this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery_story . With the advent of Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle 's Sherlock_Holmes , the <head>development</head> of the modern private_detective begins . Sherlock_Holmes is not merely an individualist ; he is very close to being a mental_case . A brief list of the great detective 's little idiosyncrasies would provide Dr._Freud with ample food_for_thought . Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants ; he is prone to semi catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln ; he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist .</context>

      <context> The second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower 's Commission_on_National_Goals , titled Goals_For_Americans . They , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower requested that the Commission be administered by the American_Assembly_of_Columbia_University , because it was non-partisan . The Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of_what I would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism . And here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above : `` The paramount goal of the United_States , set long_ago , was to guard the rights of the individual , ensure his <head>development</head> , enlarge his opportunity '' . This group is secularist and their program tends to be technological . But it is the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as symptom of the common_man 's malaise .

      <context> But in looking_at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the South , it is important not to lose the broader perspective . His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers . Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic_romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in_particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry_James and James_Joyce among them . His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary <head>development</head> back of him . My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked_at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by_no_means new with him , and most_of the problems he takes_up have had the attention of authors before him . A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region .</context>

      <context> One who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger .

And , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature '' . Henrietta was discovering in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the <head>development</head> of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition . Dr._Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of Sara_Sullam that he considered submitting it to the Century_Magazine or Harper 's but he decided that its Jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in The_Messenger , `` so our readers will be benefited instead '' . Under her father 's influence it did not occur to Henrietta that she might write_on subjects outside the Jewish field , but she did begin writing for other Anglo_Jewish papers and thus increased her output and her audience . And she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of Judas_Maccabeus performed at the Hanukkah festival which came in December .</context>

      <context> I mean something more like Freud 's concept of the utility of `` play '' to a small child : he plays `` house '' or `` doctor '' or `` fireman '' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control . There is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time . In B._M._Spinley 's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience . Perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the <head>development</head> of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation . Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean . It is at_least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as_well_as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature . In any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions , particularly with_respect_to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature '' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required .</context>

It was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional <head>development</head> . The lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treating domestic sewage . The pilot plant was a circular lagoon 81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom , 4 ft below the surface , with a volume of 121000 gal . The side slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to prevent erosion .</context>

The bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in_arrears , and the real_estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual <head>development</head> for white working people who were coming_in , and that none would be sold to colored folk . When it was proposed to rebuild the church , Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high . He was sure that he could do better if he went_to Atlanta to get the deal financed . But when this proposal was made to his Deacon_Board , he met unanimous opposition .</context>

      <context> I called the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves_Moreland , the Anglo-American literary critic - his mother was_born in Ohio - who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson_Downs , raising_hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old_man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such_as human stature , hope , and humor . My unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in_terms_of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the <head>development</head> of the human mind . After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe_in the cult_of_personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . A bee 's place is in the hive '' . `` I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and_then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand .</context>

      <context> This was delivered in a forthright way , without coyness and over pretended interest - an admirable way with children . Only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command . This nettled the children into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment . `` We bump '' , one said ; and the other went_on to <head>development</head> of the idea . `` We grind , too '' , he said . My mother was beside_herself with curiosity . `` Say that again '' , she pleaded .</context>

Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; and they had told their mother about the tumbles .
