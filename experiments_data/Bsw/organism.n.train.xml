Robert Rosen ( 1991 ) built on this by defining a system component as " a unit of organization ; a part with a function , i.e. , a definite relation between part and whole . " From this and other starting concepts , he developed a " relational theory of systems " that attempts to explain the special properties of life .

      <context> Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional_arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . A previously extinguished conditioned_reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . It seems to follow that by_and_large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as_far_as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the <head>organism</head> . In_addition , the neocortical hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates . But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such_as the rat , sex_activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral_brain is enhanced by the neocortex .

      <context> Thus , a low intensity of hypothalamic cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition . Moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induces , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous_system . With the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur . Since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep , it may be said that the reactivity of the whole <head>organism</head> is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus . Similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals . Of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect . Although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance .</context>
