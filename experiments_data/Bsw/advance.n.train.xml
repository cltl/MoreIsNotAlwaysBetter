      <context> Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray_machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy_machine . Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis . Commonly used electronic_devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit TV and audio_systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices . In this article we will concentrate_on the <head>advances</head> in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow 's commonplace equipment originates . From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a_few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research . Many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible_light and must be stained for microscopic investigation . This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or_else colors only the outside .</context>

      <context> Marketing in the new decade will be no picnic - for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20 - 25 yr. . Why ? Companies of all types have made great <head>advances</head> in production capabilities and efficiencies - in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged R_+_D facilities , faster new product development . Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge . Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yr. ? Based on our experience with clients , we see 14 major problems which fall_into three broad groups - the market_place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management .</context>

      <context> Rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases . The machine quack makes his Rube_Goldberg devices out of odds_and_ends of metals , wires , and radio parts . With these gadgets - impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light_bulbs , ticks , and buzzes - he then carries_out a vicious medical con_game , capitalizing on people 's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age . He milks the latest scientific <head>advances</head> , translating them into his own special Buck_Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay_fever to sexual impotence and cancer . The gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $ 5 to $ 10000 - anything the traffic will bear . He may call himself a naprapath , a physiotherapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a `` doctor '' - or what have you . Not_only do these quacks assume impressive titles , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations - foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence .</context>

      <context> What additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ? In the physical_sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic_physics . In the life_sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio - and physiological chemistry . The major effect of these <head>advances</head> appears to lie_in the part they have played in the industrial_revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment . In_addition , our way of dealing directly with natural_phenomena has also changed . Even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking , but where some explanations are possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquakes , the appropriate kind of human_action has been more adequately indicated . Apparently the population as_a_whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears .</context>

      <context> Apparently the population as_a_whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears . How and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study . In some areas , the progress is slower than in others . In agriculture , for_example , despite the <head>advances</head> in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster . In child_care , the opposite extreme prevails ; procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory . There are many domains in which understanding has brought_about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear . Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared .</context>

      <context> As cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy increasing properties of the external world . The useful suggestion of Professor_David_Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments . One wonders about its applicability to people . Will <head>advances</head> in human sciences help us build social_structures and governments which will enable us to cope_with people as_effectively_as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic_acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? The answer is of_course yes . For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people . Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes .</context>

      <context> As I have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known_as the Buy American Act . I urge once_again that the Congress not reenact this rider . The task of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without endangering other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress . The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid <head>advances</head> in military technology in history . Some weapons_systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development . Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon_system , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems . This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons_systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_systems which have been overtaken by events .</context>
