      <context> the success of Communism 's war against the West does not depend_on such spectacular and definitive conquests . Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence . Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages . Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant - in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the <head>United_Nations</head> , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences - preferably at the highest level . The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first_step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West . Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country . The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in_fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy .</context>

      <context> The long road that had taken liberals in_this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State . And the USSR existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in_this country was spiritually Marxist . We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San_Francisco to set_up the legal framework , finally and at_last , to rationalize war - to rationalize want and fear - out of the world : the <head>United_Nations</head> . We of the liberal led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation . Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally . During the next five years the leaders of the Fair_Deal reluctantly backed_down from the optimistic expectations of the New_Deal .</context>

      <context> I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces . This means practically everybody in this room . Whether it will strike_home for you or not will be for you to determine . The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a colleague , a question from the Secretary or the President , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the agenda of the <head>United_Nations</head> or of any other of dozens of international bodies , a news_item read at the breakfast_table , a question to the President or the Secretary at a news_conference , a speech by a Senator or Congressman , an article in a periodical , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad , et_cetera , ad_infinitum . The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility . His first thought is about the question itself : Is there a question here for American foreign_policy , and , if so , what is it ?</context>

      <context> The selection of the wrong tools can mean waste , at_best , and at_worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself . Can the President or the Secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required ? Should the action be unilateral or multilateral ? Is the matter one for the <head>United_Nations</head> or some_other international body ? For , if so , the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem . What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in_general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it .</context>
