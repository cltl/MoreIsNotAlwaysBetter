Anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions . One is an imperial London stockbroker called Jerebohm .

      <context> The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration . Your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score . It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high_fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener . The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its <head>scope</head> since Feyer 's four-sided LP edition of 1958 for Angel ) , this set is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment . The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari 's melodramatic contrasts between ultra vehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality . And in its engineers ' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super high_fidelity '' . The home listener is overpowered , all_right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one .</context>

This masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people : earthy , salty and humorous . Of_course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them .

Considering the high cost of the F-108 system - over $ 4 billion for the force that had been planned - and the time_period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project . Meanwhile , other air_defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message . The size and <head>scope</head> of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans .

      <context> MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral_brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic_brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related_to fight and flight and also on sexual functions . It should be added that in man neocortical hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity . Previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response . The visceral_brain as_well_as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory , but this topic is beyond the <head>scope</head> of this paper . After this brief discussion of neo - , paleocortical , and cortico-hypothalamic relations , let us return once_more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance . Facilitatory processes take_place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways . Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges .</context>

      <context> In_theory , compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer . The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken_up later . In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress , and the children 's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years . In establishing criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the <head>scope</head> beyond the reading act itself .

Other classes are included only by myself ( interrogatives , adverbs ) or only by Swadesh and Hoijer ( pronouns , demonstratives ) .

      <context> No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action . To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy . First , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity . National identification was not new , but it was accelerating in intensity and <head>scope</head> throughout Europe as new unifications occurred . It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will '' put_forward by the Germans , especially by Hegel , although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of Hobbes . National identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which incorporated this Hegelian abstraction and saw law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection . In the international community this reduced law to Jellinek 's auto_limitation .</context>

      <context> Obviously , a satisfactory answer to the third question is imperative , if the argument is to get under_way at_all , for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient 's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital lesion , any findings whatsoever in regard_to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of_course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion . The answer the authors give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance . It is as_follows : `` The usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness ( pressure , pain , temperature ) , as_well_as the kinesthetic sensations ( muscular feelings , feelings in the tendons and joints ) , were , as_such , essentially intact , although they seemed , in_comparison_with normal reactions , to be somewhat diminished over the entire body . The supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member , as_well_as the direction and <head>scope</head> of a movement , passively executed ( with one of his members ) , proved to have been , on_the_contrary , very considerably affected '' . The authors insist , however , that these abnormalities in the sense_of_touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight . First_of_all , what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged ? ( 1 ) When an object was placed in the patient 's hand , he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it was made of wood , iron , cloth , rubber , and_so_on .</context>
