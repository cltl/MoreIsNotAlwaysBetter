      <context> For the special case of unconstrained uniaxial tension or compression , Young 's modulus can be thought of as a measure <head>of</head> the stiffness of a material . The stiffness of a structure is of principal importance in many engineering applications , so the modulus of elasticity is often one of the primary properties considered when selecting a material . A high modulus of elasticity is sought when deflection is undesirable , while a low modulus of elasticity is required when flexibility is needed .</context>

      <context> Stiffness is the rigidity <head>of</head> an object â€” the extent to which it resists deformation in response to an applied force . The complementary concept is flexibility or pliability : the more flexible an object is , the less stiff it is .</context>

      <context> It 's a complete thigh contraction extension exercise . It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from_start_to_finish of each repetition . It improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder , and helps to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed . It increases <head>flexibility</head> of the legs . It speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately , thus enabling a massive , concentrated effort to be focused_on each . You 'll need your Weider_Power_Stands for this fine exercise and here 's the way it 's done : Place your Power_Stands in position and adjust their height so_that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean .</context>

      <context> The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms , but about 1930 it was in_favor_of games . The parallel_bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal_bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football . But the Russians use gymnastics as the first_step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance . The gymnast must develop strength , <head>flexibility</head> , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection . In short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great_deal of character as_well . The addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen . Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life .</context>

      <context> I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in_relation_to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare . Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army_Reserve . Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National_Guard contained in the 1960 Department_of_Defense Appropriation_Act should likewise be dropped . I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the <head>flexibility</head> to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . I again proposed a reduction in the Army National_Guard and Army_Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal_year 1961 . These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives . - About 30 % of the expenditures for the Department_of_Defense in 1961 are for military_personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel .</context>

      <context> Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international_law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political_system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; second , it had to be compatible with the value_system that they shared . In both respects , international_law was Europeanized . It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions . On_the_one_hand , the major European_nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` <head>flexibility</head> of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience . But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard_to most_of the rest of the world . Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere . Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin_America ( though limited in Latin_America by the special interest of the United_States as expressed in the Monroe_Doctrine , itself from the outset related_to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance_of_power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in_order to preserve both common economic_values and the European `` balance '' itself .</context>
