      <context> Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria . Many types of bacteriophage exist , some simply infect and lyse their host bacteria , while others insert into the bacterial chromosome . A bacteriophage can contain genes that contribute to <head>its</head> host 's phenotype : for example , in the evolution of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Clostridium botulinum , the toxin genes in an integrated phage converted a harmless ancestral bacterium into a lethal pathogen .</context>

      <context> The third method of <head>gene</head> transfer is conjugation , whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact . Transformation , unlike transduction or conjugation , depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process , and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer . In order for a bacterium to bind , take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome , it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence ( see Natural competence ) .</context>
