      <context> By delaying the issue of republic versus monarchy for his <head>36-year</head> dictatorship , and by refusing to take up the throne himself in 1947 , Franco sought to antagonize neither the monarchical Carlists ( who preferred the restoration of a Bourbon ) , nor the republican " old shirts " , i.e. , the original Falangists . In 1961 , Franco offered Otto von Habsburg the throne , but was refused , and ultimately followed Otto 's recommendation by selecting the young Juan Carlos of Bourbon in 1969 as his officially designated heir to the throne , shortly after his 30th birthday ( the minimum age required under the Law of Succession ) . In 1968 , under United Nations pressure , Franco granted Spain 's colony of Equatorial Guinea its independence , and the next year , ceded the exclave of Ifni to Morocco .</context>

      <context> He does n't think that potting them from a deck_chair on the south_side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting . But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish . It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel_de_Cervantes ' `` Don_Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide_screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth_Street and Sixty-eighth_Street_Playhouses . More_than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho_Panza , in seventeenth century <head>Spain</head> , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . Nikolai_Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander_Nevsky and Ivan_the_Terrible , performs the lanky Don_Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . His addle-brained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no_doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues . Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do .</context>
