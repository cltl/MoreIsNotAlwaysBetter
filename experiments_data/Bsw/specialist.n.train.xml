      <context> In some countries Anesthesiology is classified as a surgical discipline , since it <head>is</head> vital in the surgical process , though anesthesiologists never perform major surgery themselves . A further subdivision is the diagnostic versus therapeutic specialties . While the diagnostic process is of great importance in all specialties , some specialists perform mainly or only diagnostic examinations , such as pathology , clinical neurophysiology , and radiology .</context>

      <context> Strange , but true - authenticity and realism often are n't related at_all . Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic - in_fact , impeccably so .

The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research <head>specialists</head> who look to this matter . During the making recently of an important Biblical film , some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not_only of costumes and interiors , but of architectural developments , sports_arenas , vehicles , and other paraphernalia were compiled , consulted , and complied with . But , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set 's edge . The drama itself - and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama - often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at_all .</context>

      <context> That 's when he went_to Professor_Claude . And at_once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it . In his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked_out '' equipment since Vic_Tanny . Mr._Claude is a <head>specialist</head> in torso development and he has long favored the now famous Weider_Push-Pull_Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . So right_away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull_Super-Set consisting_of the wide grip Straight-Arm_Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull_Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib_cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar Bench_Press which specifically works_on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids . As you can see , in this Push-Pull_Super_Set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises , so the complete torso remains pumped-up all_the_time ! Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 1 , the professor allows him about a five minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 2 .</context>
