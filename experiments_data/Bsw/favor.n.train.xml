      <context> This opinion is supported by one of the nation 's leading psychiatrists , Dr._Maurice_E._Linden , director of the Mental_Health_Division of the Philadelphia_Department_of_Public_Health . `` When the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower '' , Dr._Linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' . In one extreme case , cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker 's wife refused to have sexual_relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded . To win her <head>favors</head> , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer . Caught at_last , he was sentenced to prison .

One wife , described by a New_York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual_relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday night neighborhood card parties . Another put sex on a dollars and cents basis . After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband 's overtures until the matter was settled in her <head>favor</head> . Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed . The wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart_as_a_whip - often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage .
