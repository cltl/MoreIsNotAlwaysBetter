      <context> That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' . One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite . Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy . The London_Universe devoted its centenary issue last <head>December</head> 8 to mapping_out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one_hundred years . With traditional nationalistic spirit , some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best . I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics . It has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses at Mass .</context>

      <context> The good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well_known in England . The Holy_Sacrifice of the Mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months . And it was interesting to observe that B.B.C. . 's television film on Christmas_Eve was The_Bells_of_St._Mary's . Of_course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr._Fisher , then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury , to the Vatican last <head>December</head> . It was the first time an English Primate has done this since the 14th century . English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope . Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants ; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary_school during the sickness of one of its masters ; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` Catholics , if the present system is still in_operation , will constitute almost one-third of the House_of_Lords in the next generation '' ; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic_church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave .</context>

      <context> It was Dickson who suggested to Lord_Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United_States . In September 1817 at Fort_Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of Sioux , he escorted to Prairie_du_Chien . During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United_States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red_River and that the United_States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England . Upon arriving_at Baltimore , Selkirk on <head>December</head> 22 wrote to John_Quincy_Adams , Secretary_of_State at Washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois_Territories '' . This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at_first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements '' . The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop_into a trade_route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected .

      <context> Henrietta was discovering in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition . Dr._Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of Sara_Sullam that he considered submitting it to the Century_Magazine or Harper 's but he decided that its Jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in The_Messenger , `` so our readers will be benefited instead '' . Under her father 's influence it did not occur to Henrietta that she might write_on subjects outside the Jewish field , but she did begin writing for other Anglo_Jewish papers and thus increased her output and her audience . And she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of Judas_Maccabeus performed at the Hanukkah festival which came in <head>December</head> . By her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that Papa and Mamma gave her a Life_of_Dickens as a spur to her aspiration . Another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of Johns_Hopkins_University within walking distance of home . It was established in a_couple_of buildings in the shopping district , with only a_few professors , but all eminent men , and a_few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings .</context>

      <context> Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue . They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held .

By <head>December</head> , 1958 , when ' Abdallah_Ibrahim became President_of_the_Council , elections had even greater importance . They were increasingly looked_upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new , constructive national effort .
