      <context> I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention . You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment - I certainly do - but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United_States not_only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U._S. - Soviet relations for the foreseeable future . I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr._Jameson_Campaigne has done it well in his new book American_Might_and_Soviet_Myth . Suppose , he says , that the tables_were_turned , and we were in the Soviets ' position : `` There would be more_than 2000 modern Soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in <head>Mexico</head> and the Caribbean .
