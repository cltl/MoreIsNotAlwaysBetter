      <context> This help is offered to applicants who ordinarily would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds from commercial sources on reasonable terms . Each applicant is required to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored . The Government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up_to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses . The applicant pays the rest of the cost , but his own time spent on the work and <head>charges</head> for the use of equipment which he owns may be applied toward his share of the cost . Funds contributed by the Government are repaid by a royalty on production from the property . If nothing is produced , there is no obligation to repay . A 5 - percent royalty is paid on any production during the period the contract is in_effect ; if the Government certifies that production may be possible from the property , the royalty obligation continues for the 10 - year period usually specified in the contract or until the Government 's contribution is repaid with interest .</context>

However , a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes_under_the_name_of van_der_Waal_'s_forces .

I realized , now , that she had been showing me , in what impressed me as being a very accurate way , something her mother had once said to her ; it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her . What had been an unmanageably powerful introject was now , despite its continuing <head>charge</head> of energy disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like . Earlier , this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at_times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice . A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used_to often seclude herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door - as I would find on passing_by , between our sessions - for_all_the_world like two persons , a scolding mother and a defensive child . Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome .</context>

      <context> The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long known hymn tunes .

In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . Dominant stress is of_course more than extended duration , and normally centers_on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center_on its first syllable rather than its last .

He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments . In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took_part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the <head>charge</head> that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned '' .

At the close of Davis ' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously : Whereas , John_Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper :</context>
