      <context> Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers . Despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before - traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer . Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : Has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for <head>future</head> planning ? Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? Have you actually checked_out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ?

The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them .

If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real_life . Dr._H._V._Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University_of_Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification . As_a_matter_of_fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr._Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day .</context>

      <context> There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams . The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental_image can find no logical support . A `` mental_image '' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at_all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth_dimension . Dreams that display events of the <head>future</head> with photographic detail call_for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja_vu , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem . As in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain . But then this theory confesses that it is completely at_a_loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain . The opening paragraph of the chapter titled The_Theory_Of_Representative_Perception , in the book Philosophies_Of_Science by Albert_G._Ramsperger says , `` passed_on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception '' .</context>

      <context> Gone is the tabula_rasa of the mind . In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one 's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught . The principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy '' is Alfred_North_Whitehead . Our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the <head>future</head> . We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening . Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience . It takes a great_deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one 's world simply as a collection of sense_data arranged in such_and_such sequence and pattern , devoid_of all power to move the feelings and actions except in_so_far as they present themselves for inspection .</context>

      <context> It was true that they could be approximated , but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations ? Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo . Consider the tense_system . Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or <head>future</head> , Siddo used an entirely different word . Thus , the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai , meaning to live , was , in the perfect_tense , ksu'u'peli'afo , and , in the future , mai'teipa . The same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses .

      <context> My unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in_terms_of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe_in the cult_of_personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . A bee 's place is in the hive '' . `` I have come to talk with you about the <head>future</head> of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and_then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand . `` I seem to remember '' , he said , `` that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live . Did you go_to their funeral '' ? `` I was wrong '' , I admitted .</context>
