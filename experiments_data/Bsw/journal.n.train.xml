      <context> The earliest use of the word to mean <head>a</head> book in which a daily record was written was in Ben Jonson 's comedy Volpone in 1605 . The oldest extant diaries come from Middle Eastern and East Asian cultures , although the even earlier work To Myself ( Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν ) , today known as the Meditations , written in Greek by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius in the second half of the 2nd century AD , already displays many characteristics of a diary . Pillowbooks of Japanese court ladies and Asian travel journals offer some aspects of this genre of writing , although they rarely consist exclusively of diurnal records .</context>
