Similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz_groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal . `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' may have wound_up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer . By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today 's artists , the program turned_out to be a not quite perfect <head>example</head> of either . Still , the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated . Even Joan_Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan_Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti 's `` Lucia_di_Lammermoor '' Sunday night . The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing_ovation as Miss_Sutherland took curtain_call after curtain_call following a fantastic `` Mad_Scene '' created on_her_own and with the help of the composer and the other performers .</context>

It might be contended , of_course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism . But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben_Gurion and set_forth in the indictment . In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear <head>example</head> and not have_to be tied to the issue by argument . One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages . Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell_into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism . Yes , he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of_course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; but he believed in the Jew as enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things .</context>

      <context> The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave_rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize . It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter_solstice . This and other fears of the solar_system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic_system and its built-in concept of periodicity and_then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions . This understanding provides a very simple <head>example</head> of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .

Will advances in human sciences help us build social_structures and governments which will enable us to cope_with people as_effectively_as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic_acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? The answer is of_course yes .

Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes . But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides .

      <context> The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it . In_fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in_this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears . In_fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty . Perhaps the most illuminating <head>example</head> of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease .

      <context> There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud . And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact . Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man . Constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor_unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world_courts , and the veto power in world_councils are but a_few <head>examples</head> .

      <context> There is evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William_Gilmore_Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such_as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him . Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus_Baldwin_Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy_Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an <head>example</head> followed by many after him . Others who wrote_of low characters and low life included Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , creator of the Big_Bear of Arkansas and Tom_Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson_Jones_Hooper , whose character Simon_Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem_Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried_out his will ; and George_Washington_Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut_Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner 's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a_hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner 's time . Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long established literary precedent .</context>

      <context> This , no_doubt , is part of what Gilbert_Seldes implies when he says of the arts , `` They give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense '' . Men seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that_is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized . Feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation . A need so deeply planted , asking for direction , so_to_speak , is likely to be gratified by the vivid <head>examples</head> and heroic proportions of literature . The terms `` renewal '' and `` refreshed '' , which often come_up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal '' of purpose and a `` refreshed '' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction . The notion of `` inspiration '' is somehow cognate to this feeling .

Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times - granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside - are correct ; but all_too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took_place in the early first millennium . The focus of novelty in this world now lay_in the south-eastern districts of the Greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean , always excepting its northern shores , had accepted the Geometric style of pottery . While Protogeometric vases usually turn_up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as_many or more <head>examples</head> of local stamp , these `` non Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century . In their place came local variations within the common style - tentative , as_it_were , in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed . Attica , though important , was not the only teacher of this age . One can take a vase of about 800 B.C. and , without any knowledge of its place_of_origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable .</context>

      <context> The readers of the Providence_Daily_Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old_Brown '' had a fair trial . Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' . In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical . J._Wheaton_Smith , editor of the Warren_Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary <head>example</head> must be set , in_order_that all those misnamed philantropists [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' . The editor of the Newport_Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment . In direct_contrast to the other Rhode_Island editors , Samuel_S._Foss of the Woonsocket_Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair . Concerning the sentence , Foss wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John_Brown 's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment , it would be well - well for the country and for Virginia '' .</context>

      <context> The appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly_line and wants enough land_area to do the entire job on one floor . To light industry , the economies of being on one floor are much slighter , but efficiency_engineers usually believe_in them , and manufacturers looking_for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning_to efficiency_engineers . This movement of industry away from the central_cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe . It is merely the latest <head>example</head> of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities . The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities - the rubber factories in Akron , Chrysler 's Detroit plants , U._S._Steel 's Pittsburgh works - often began on these sites at_a_time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( piers ) and power ( river ) . The `` leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam_turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not_yet blighted . The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in selecting his plant site .</context>

      <context> But there 's one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just do n't think there is , and that 's a sportin ' way o ' killin ' a man '' ! After the first two murders , the warning notes were rarely ignored . The lesson had been learned . The <head>examples</head> were plain . When Fred_Powell 's brother-in-law , Charlie_Keane , moved_into the dead man 's home , the anonymous letter_writer took no chances on Charlie taking_up where Fred had left_off and wasted no time on a first notice : If you do n't leave this country within 3 days , your life will be taken the same as Powell 's was . This was the message found tacked to the cabin door .</context>

      <context> `` Not in the largest sense of the words '' , I said . `` The other day Arnold_Toynbee spoke against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe_in the uniqueness of its religions , its ideologies , and its virtually everything else . Why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something else ? Forty years ago an English writer , W._L._George , dealt with this subject in Eddies_of_the_Day , and said , as an <head>example</head> , that ' Saint_George for Merry_England ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' Strike frog eating Frenchmen dead '' ' ! `` There was also Gott_strafe_Angleterre '' , Moreland reminded me , `` and Carthago_delenda_est , or if you will , Deus_strafe_Carthage . It is n't what the ideologist believes_in , but what he hates , that puts the world in jeopardy . This is the force , in our time and in every other time , that urges the paranoiac and the manic-depressive to become head of a state .</context>
