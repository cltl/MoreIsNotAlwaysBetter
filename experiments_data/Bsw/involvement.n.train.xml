      <context> Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man_in_the_street . It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine . After_all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control . Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional <head>involvement</head> . Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes . In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose . A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever_changing land .</context>

      <context> The central concern of Erich_Auerbach 's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved . Following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels , the Christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures '' of divine power and reality . Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent . Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the <head>involvement</head> of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama . The artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction . He is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped . I have chosen to use the word `` mimesis '' in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the Christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the Greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection .</context>

In the first instance , `` mimesis '' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in_terms_of vivid images rather than in_terms_of abstract ideas or conventional designations . By `` image '' is meant not_only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith . This is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated .</context>

      <context> With this enlarged role in mind , I should_like to make a_few suggestions : What we in the United_States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world . We in this Department must think_about foreign_policy in its total context . We cannot regard foreign_policy as something left_over after defense_policy or trade_policy or fiscal_policy has been extracted . Foreign_policy is the total <head>involvement</head> of the American people with peoples and governments abroad . That means that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in_terms_of the total context of our situation . It is the concern of the Department_of_State that the American people are safe and secure - defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department_of_Defense . It is also the concern of the Department_of_State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active - this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department_of_Commerce .</context>

      <context> There has been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance . This seems naive . Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology when designing orthographies . Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be <head>involvement</head> in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs . The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic ' esthetics ' , which usually turns_out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried_over from European languages . Many_of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they purport to represent . Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance .</context>

      <context> Juanita drooped about the place , wearing a haunted , brooding look , which Kate attributed to the baby 's death , until the day a letter came for her addressed to `` Miss_Juanita_Fitzroy '' , bearing a Grafton postmark . Seeing the slanting hand , Kate knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel . The Federal forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving to take all the mountains . Kate tried to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended , at what <head>involvement</head> existed for Juanita . Uncle_Randolph and Joel had replanted the bottom_lands with difficulty , for more of the slaves , including Annie , had sneaked_off when the soldiers broke_camp . Joel worked like a field_hand in the afternoons after school . He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers_Ferry .</context>
