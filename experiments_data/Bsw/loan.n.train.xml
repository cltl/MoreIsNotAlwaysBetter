      <context> Examples of loanwords in the English language include café ( from French café , which literally means " coffee " ) , bazaar ( from Persian bāzār , which means " market " ) , and kindergarten ( from German Kindergarten , which literally means " children 's <head>garden</head> " ) . In a bit of heterological irony , the word calque is a loanword from the French noun , derived from the verb calquer ( to trace , to copy ) , and the word loanword is a calque of the German word Lehnwort , and the phrase " loan translation " is a calque of the German Lehnübersetzung .</context>

      <context> Rep._James_Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water_development bill passed by the Texas House_of_Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort_Worth to cover_up places like Paradise , a Wise_County hamlet of 250 people . When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas . Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen._Parkhouse . The bill would increase from $ 5000000 to $ 15000000 the maximum <head>loan</head> the state could make to a local water_project . Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas . Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water_program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten 's attack . The bill 's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J._W._Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio_(_Kika_)_de_la_Garza of Mission , Sam_F._Collins of Newton and Joe_Chapman of Sulphur_Springs .</context>

      <context> But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman . For three years , since the liquor territorial conference , Torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated O_'_Banion 's impudent double-crossing . They had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in Cicero . When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the <head>loan</head> of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O_'_Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $ 20000 a month . In six months O_'_Banion had boosted the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb . These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; once_again O_'_Banion 's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill_will . The revenue from O_'_Banion 's Cicero territory went_up still higher , until the yield was more_than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago 's South and West_Sides .</context>
