      <context> Our pitching is much better than it has shown '' . The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch_Stadium yesterday . Until the Bucs ' bats quieted_down a_bit in Cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over .300 . Despite the <head>recession</head> , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky_Burgess .455 , Gino_Cimoli .389 , Bill_Virdon .340 , Bob_Clemente and Dick_Groat , each .323 , Dick_Stuart .306 , Don_Hoak .280 and Bob_Skinner .267 . Bill_Mazeroski with .179 and Hal_Smith with .143 were the only Pirates dragging_their_feet . Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit_out most of the series is Bob_Friend , who was beaten by The_Man twice last season on dramatic home_runs . Friend is off to a great start with a 4 - 0 record but is n't likely to see action here this week .</context>
