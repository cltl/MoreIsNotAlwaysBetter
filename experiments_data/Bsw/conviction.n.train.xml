      <context> Then Rudy_Bond was simply grand as Ben , the distraught Republican_Party district chieftain . And Paul_Lipson , as Morris , the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley 's dinner , was fine , too . As for the ladies , they were full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man . Charlotte_Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie , who became the second Mrs._LaGuardia , singing and acting with remarkable <head>conviction</head> . Jen_Nelson , as Thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive . And little Zeme_North , a Dora with real spirit and verve , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for Floyd , the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings . Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` On_the_Side_of_the_Angels '' and `` Politics_and_Poker '' were handled splendidly , and I thought Rudy_Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` Little_Tin_Box '' even better than it was done by the New_York cast ; all the words of its clever lyrics came_through with perfect clarity .</context>

      <context> It casts a spell upon them so_that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power . It is not enough in accounting_for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect . For this does not account_for the integral , elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell . The reality of spirit emerges in_this play in_spite_of the author 's <head>convictions</head> to_the_contrary . There is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit . Apart from spirit there could be no community , for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity , cohesiveness , and permanence . Think , for_example , of the spirit of the Marine_Corps .</context>

      <context> But , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a_fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God 's providence , presents it . And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men . Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends . In arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ; and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set_forth reasons to justify such a <head>conviction</head> . But the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable . This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition . If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the right to say anything at_all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian .</context>

      <context> That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard_to birth_control today . Up_to the turn_of_the_century , contraception was condemned by all Christian_churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine_law . This was generally reflected in the civil_laws of Christian countries . Today , the Roman_Catholic and Orthodox_Churches stand virtually alone in holding that <head>conviction</head> . The various Lambeth_Conferences , expressing the Anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken_place among Protestants generally . In 1920 , the Lambeth_Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together_with the grave dangers - physical , moral , and religious - thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' . Denouncing the view that the sexual_union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded_as the governing considerations of Christian marriage .</context>

      <context> The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family_planning . It called_for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives . The general board declared : `` Most_of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right . The general Protestant <head>conviction</head> is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' . An action once universally condemned by all Christian_churches and forbidden by the civil_law is now not_only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant_denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty . This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country . Repeated polls have disclosed that most married_couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth_control .</context>

      <context> This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country . Repeated polls have disclosed that most married_couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth_control . For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral <head>conviction</head> of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief . Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil_law is concerned with public crimes . Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil_authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin .</context>

      <context> Still another boy asserted : `` To be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; it 's to be a good_person '' . When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It 's the same thing '' . This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad . They discovered that , although 42 per_cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per_cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per_cent of the Jewish students had this <head>conviction</head> . The most important aims of the Jewish students were as_follows : to make the world a better place to live in - 30 per_cent ; to get happiness for yourself - 28 per_cent ; and financial independence - 21 per_cent . Nevertheless , most_of the teen-agers I interviewed believed_in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple . However , they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy , professing to believe_in Judaism `` but in a moderate way '' .</context>

      <context> Into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama Henrietta , as every artist delights to do , wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and - especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair - into the relations of men and women : `` In their relations , she was the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander . His feeling always exacted sacrifices from her . One is so accustomed to think_of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and women as submissive and yielding , that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned , and we condemn the woman as a coquette . The very firmness of her <head>convictions</head> and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts ; usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived_notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly . She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man . Women themselves have come to look_upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld . She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done .</context>

      <context> In_addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society . The two have never been separable . Religion is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation . The value-system of a community or society is always correlated with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more_or_less shared system of religious_beliefs and <head>convictions</head> . The religion supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values . Even in the united_states , with its freedom of religious_belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values . This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value_orientation elsewhere ; for_example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism .</context>

      <context> Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . At another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother introject began to emerge more_and_more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' ! I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; but a_few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you '' ! Again , I at_first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication , and I quickly cast through my mind to account_for her being able to speak , with such utter <head>conviction</head> , of an opinion held by my father , now several years deceased . Then I replied , coldly , `` If you despise me , why do n't you say so , directly '' ? She looked confused at this , and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make . It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you '' ?</context>

      <context> The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic ' esthetics ' , which usually turns_out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried_over from European languages . Many_of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they purport to represent . Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance . As a result , many people have been confirmed in their <head>conviction</head> that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion . A._E._Sharp , in Vowel-Length_and_Syllabicity_in_Kikuyu , examines one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in_detail . His objective is merely to determine `` what distinctions of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography '' ( 59 ) . To do so , he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in_detail .</context>
