      <context> The purpose of the Christian Church Militant is <head>to</head> struggle against sin , the devil and " ..the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places " ( Ephesians 6:12 ) , but it is not a violent movement . An example of the adjective usages is demonstrated when The New York Times ran an article titled Militant Environmentalists Planning Summer Protests to Save Redwoods describing a group that believes in " confrontational demonstrations " and " nonviolent tactics " to get across their message of preserving the environment . Another usage example includes ' a militant political activist ' , drawing attention to behaviours typical of those engaged in intensive political activism .</context>
