      <context> He won the Masters , the United_States_Open and a record $ 80738 in prize_money . He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports_Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional_Athlete_of_the_Year '' , a distinction that earned for him the $ 10000 diamond - studded Hickok_Belt . But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . A_couple_of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a <head>par</head> 5 hole . It made him human . And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair . If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all .</context>

      <context> If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . The world 's best golfer , shooting below <head>par</head> , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los_Angeles_open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . He boomed a 280 - yard drive . Then the pixies and the zombies took_over while the banshees wailed in the distance . On the narrow fairway of a 508 - yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot .</context>

      <context> Perhaps a list of some of the `` practices '' of my company will help here . The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles . From an initial investment of $ 1200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $ 10000000 ( we do n't disclose financial figures to the public ) . Its growth continues steadily on a <head>par</head> with past growth ; and no limitation is in_evidence . Our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a_few years time , despite substantial , well established competition .</context>
