      <context> They germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily . It does n't really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours . I like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold_frames . Pansies do n't have to be coddled ; they 'd rather have things rugged , with only moderate <head>protection</head> on the coldest days . If you do use a cold_frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate . For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting . I dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray .</context>

      <context> Few rural_areas are protected by zoning . A tavern , filling_station , junk_yard , rendering plant , or some other business may go_up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value .

      <context> Generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city . The savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed . Usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more . Where schools , fire and police <head>protection</head> , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real_estate taxes are usually about the same . A part-time farmer and his family can use their spare_time profitably . Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational . For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner .</context>

      <context> Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks <head>protection</head> in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the nations . But though this characterization in_no_way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of_it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final_Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ?</context>

      <context> Will advances in human sciences help us build social_structures and governments which will enable us to cope_with people as_effectively_as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic_acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? The answer is of_course yes . For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people . Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant <head>protection</head> of a boat the formulations of Archimedes . But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides . We have ample light when the sun sets ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; the range of our voice ignores distance . At what stage are social_sciences then ?</context>

      <context> It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins ' pronouncement in Pleas_of_the_Crown from a metaphysical point_of_view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married_couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such_that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal_law as if there were no marriage . By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the <head>protection</head> which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of law '' .</context>
