      <context> The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it . In_fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in_this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears . In_fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty . Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased <head>knowledge</head> of the nature of disease . The situation with regard_to our attitude and `` control '' of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with_respect_to people . The fear of disease was formerly very_much the kind of fear I have tried to describe .</context>

      <context> Not discussed here are some military problems of modern_times such_as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision_making are not the bottlenecks . Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain_forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach . This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for_example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry . We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and <head>knowledge</head> for useful purposes .

      <context> While Protogeometric vases usually turn_up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as_many or more examples of local stamp , these `` non Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century .

Attica , though important , was not the only teacher of this age . One can take a vase of about 800 B.C. and , without any <head>knowledge</head> of its place_of_origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable .
