      <context> In_the_first_place our business is foreign_policy , and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem . Mr._Truman emphasized this point by saying , `` You fellows in the Department_of_State do n't know much about domestic politics '' . This is an important consideration . If we sit here reading editorials and looking at public_opinion_polls and other reports that cross our desks , we should realize that this is raw , undigested opinion expressed in the absence of <head>leadership</head> . What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership . We cannot test public_opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action . I doubt , for_example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk_about what came to be the Marshall_plan , any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals .</context>

      <context> We in this Department must think_about foreign_policy in its total context . We cannot regard foreign_policy as something left_over after defense_policy or trade_policy or fiscal_policy has been extracted . Foreign_policy is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad . That means that , if we are to achieve a new standard of <head>leadership</head> , we must think in_terms_of the total context of our situation . It is the concern of the Department_of_State that the American people are safe and secure - defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department_of_Defense . It is also the concern of the Department_of_State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active - this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department_of_Commerce . We can no_longer rely_on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments .</context>

      <context> Annual authorizations of $ 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians . The Federal program of vocational education merely provides financial_aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools . The initiative , administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts . Even the states remain primarily in an assisting role , providing <head>leadership</head> and teacher training . Federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local districts must pay at_least half . The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . Throughout the history of the program , state_government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures , while local districts all_together have spent more_than either Federal or state_governments .</context>

      <context> Russell had reached the house as Cook surmised , dismounted , but just as the old trapper opened the door to receive him , he fell into the trapper 's arms - dead . A bullet fired by one of the Mexicans hiding in a little chicken house had passed_through his head , tearing a hole two inches square on the outgoing side . Finding him dead , Cook caught Russell 's horse and rode to the cattle foreman 's house to report the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins . Before daylight Sunday morning , a posse of twenty-three men under the <head>leadership</head> of Deputy_Sheriff_Frank_MacPherson of Catskill followed the trail to the house of Francisco_Chaves , where 100 to 150 Mexicans had gathered . MacPherson boldly approached the fortified adobe_house and demanded entrance . The men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even_though he offered medical_aid . The officer demanded the names of the injured men ; the Mexicans not_only refused to give them , but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it .</context>
